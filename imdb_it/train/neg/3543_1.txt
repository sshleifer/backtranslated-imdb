I have been lurking for about a couple of years. I've never been moved to post here before, so maybe this movie deserves a star for that, but I doubt it. I've just seen it on DVD, having lost to movies due to illness and never been able to watch it until now. I hadn't read much about it, I certainly didn't even think about the movie in a few months. It was just what the friend picked up in the store, so it was looked at. <br /> <br /> Bad mistake. <br /> <br /> The shot I mentioned at the top of the summary is in the trailer and on the poster. Soon after, Jason Statham has hair. As in no other GR film. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities on display here. And Ray Liotta in his underwear SHOULD be warned in advance. It's scary and fun but not in a ha-ha-humor way. It is more in a quasi-TheOffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-fail-sort-of-humor way. Each of them says the same thing: "This movie doesn't look like anything you expect from this movie." <br /> <br /> Now, based on the previous extensive film experience, I expected this film to be a film with few things. Type: <br /> <br /> () Consistent, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () It is not a complete and complete farrago of the navel, < br /> <br /> () Something more substantial than a heterogeneous group of badly made fables from what is only a standard oriental mystical ideology, dressed as a "modern, modern and self-conscious art form", <br /> <br /> () I hope it's better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed from my tone, no box could be ticked above. Instead it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Modified badly (rhythm throughout the store, jumps 70s style amateurs in high-8 style, incomprehensible "plot" "twists !!!" delivered through mounted flash-back tricks, I could go on ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shot like a depressed 14-year-old goth who had just spent the weekend looking at Truffaut and Godard with the drawn drapes <br /> <br /> (x) So he finds himself with the motive / message "I'm really smart, I", who is determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure that stupid people (ie: to all those who don't appreciate it) in the public make sure they get the point, <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> Regarding the certain capacity of some people to " get "something from this, well. I'm glad you enjoyed it. A poster said something that caught my attention: probably under-25s have figured it out better or thanks to the assembly. Maybe, but editing should make your work more accessible, not less. As for the brigade "Genius is recognized only by the illuminated" out there, go suck an onion and grow. There is nothing more conceited and selfish than those who say that the reason another person does not know great art is because he does not understand the "trade / materials / lunar cycle / filaments of supreme rational thought" that the author / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant 'is using to explain his' vision / grand scheme / unity with Gaea / great big bucket of dog patients'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, his garbage. <br /> <br /> Movies, art, stories, poems, anything designed to be seen by another human being should be engaging and moving. In some directions it is metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you are having yourself. <br /> <br /> The only way this moved me was ahead in time, two hours closer to my inevitable end. "The biggest trick I've ever done was to make you believe that any part of this film meant anything to everyone" <br /> <br /> And now, please, please, toast my sandwiches for me.
