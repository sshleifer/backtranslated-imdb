A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee a terrible movie? Economical Canadian production. THE BRAIN IS PERFECTLY ADAPTED TO THESE WORDS. The terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make it a must for all fans of BAD movies. The horror is hilarious. It seems that the post-production team has given up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, actually trying to be good! Can some ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? <br /> <br /> It's around for Christmas. A mother and daughter are killed by one of the funniest villains ever. The next day, a rebellious teenager finds himself in trouble enough to be sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a policeman's head is cut off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody ax told you some children did, who would you believe? What starts out as fun becomes boring and tiring towards the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be afraid of moments of fear. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try to be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than the main production facilities! Our ugly villain and his cohorts get the credit for dragging some of the worst recitations I've seen. Viewer discretion recommended heavily.
