Played by an unknown cast that seems to remain so, this "film" is another slasher economic film that amazes me of how it was released. In particular, I have no problems with horrors and slasher movies, in fact they are my favorites. But when they finished THIS BAD, he really takes the monkey and it's no wonder the genre has such a difficult time. The story is like a clich√© and without imagination possible with a group of people in a cabin in the middle of the woods that is torn and torn to pieces by this type of zombie / ghost. It is not the story that sucks the most, it is the atrocious acting and dialouge, the quality of the home-made direction and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the laughable effects and some incredibly lazy movies - these morons are out in full light, but are we meant to believe it's night? What the hell was the director thinking with this move? What, did you only have one day to film this? Was he afraid of the dark? (It is exhilarating to see a policeman walking in full light with a torch that acts as if it were all black, though). I imagine the positive side for the actors is that they look like people working in the local supermarket so at least they could get away from this film without ever being noticed. I'm sure one of the "boys" plays bingo in the local pub - but he's 40-45 years old. <br /> <br /> However, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time.
