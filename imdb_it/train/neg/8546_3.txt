Highly unlikely, unbelievable and inconsistent Spanish production ... well, let me see how close I can get there. The film opens with a woman who has one of her cats killed by a young girl. Then he asks his lover to take her somewhere on vacation. Call the job and ask me to lose the holidays and she says she will pay for it. The relevance to which all this is played is the assumption of anyone at the end of the film, because the boy, a dark photographer, spies on a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of Spanish horror movies apparently, taking off his bikini for a moment so as to being able to take a picture, ask her out to lunch, and then to her assignment at Witches Mountain - for reasons once again we are never aware of it. Before they leave, Patty must stop near the house and scream "scary" in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film continues with these two stop at an inn, go to the mountain and finally understand why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects of this movie that make it better than a bad movie. It has a bit of atmosphere, some of the characters are really very good (especially the deaf innkeeper and the old one), the contacts are at least adequate, and the climax - even if it makes absolutely no sense - is well choreographed (literally) with the witches in white bra and long black hair. However it doesn't make any sense, and this is a huge detractor to me. I could watch the movie ten more times and I still don't know more than I did after the first viewing. This is a big problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film based on the long series of inexpensive and atmospheric European horror films that have covered that decade. If you can get more from me than me, better power you.
