This fake journey never comes close to combining the intelligence and madness of the excellent adventure that these guys had in their first film. This episode tries to deviate from its prequel to capture some new blood from the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and does not travel anywhere interesting or fun. <br /> <br /> There is almost a half hour wasted to show the guys that they do a rock concert (and many people watch on "free TV" - since when does it happen?) Surely the writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first film were neatly joined by a convergence to the scientific presentation. Not in this film, which has practically closed the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over. <br /> <br /> The Grim Reaper was thrown into the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is hurt and lacks sparks for comedy or public involvement. There is a ZZ Top impression, hammered in for no reason. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or fun. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
