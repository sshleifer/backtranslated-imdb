After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some reviews, which I compared to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I could see the reviewers immediately. <br /> <br /> This film was a poor attempt at a similar theme. It is interesting to note that the format of the film is almost identical, but the STIMULATION is incredibly different. "10 Articles" rushes into the viewer through the 1-day movie line, while the "Lost in ..." planned better seems to stretch for a few long days. <br /> <br /> I am sure some people will see this because they have Morgan Freeman and will be disappointed. It seems that his best roles are now supporting roles in great successes, rather than leading roles in films with limited duration films of $ 10 million and independent films.
