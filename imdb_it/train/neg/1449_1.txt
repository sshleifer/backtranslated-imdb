First, before continuing to read, you must understand that I am not a neo-Nazi, I am just trying to understand Hitler correctly to make sure that no one like him regains power. <br /> <br /> I saw this series and found it horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to watch, but is it real? I searched for answers and found one: absolutely not. First, Hitler was not angry all his life, the series shows an angry Hitler, even when he is a child. Secondly, Hitler never wanted to abuse his daughter, on the contrary, it is highly probable that Hitler was actually gay and fought all his life to stifle this secret. Thirdly, people will hate me but it's true: Hitler was fascinating. How do you think he managed to come to power if he was so hateful and ugly? Because it was fascinating. This is a common point that I found in interviews with people living near or far from him (obviously, non-Jews). <br /> <br /> This series was terrible because if you think Hitler was just an angry, ugly, and of course, not at all charming bastard, you're wrong. If you think about it, you will let people like him take power in countries and don't want it. If you really understand how Hitler managed to come to power and stop thinking it was simply horrible, you will be able to find dangerous politicians like him (obviously, remember he was elected) and stop the issue before it's too late. /> <br /> Life is important to protect, this series is simply horrible to show us the truth, if we continue to see Hitler like this, another will take place exactly like the first.
