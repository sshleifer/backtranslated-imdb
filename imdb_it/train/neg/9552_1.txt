Simply good, old fool. <br /> <br /> I mean really stupid, not stupid good guys like Killer Tomatoes, or Ed Wood, this is probably the stupidest movie I've ever seen. To give this film a golden Turkey is an insult to turkeys. Calling this stupid movie is offensive even to stupid people. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of American cinema and art, it is better to really start the 3rd and 4th world war at the same time and let the cockroaches perform the show later. <br /> <br /> Now I have to get drunk to wash this insult to my disagreeing single .... <br /> <br /> This is really a good movie if you're suicidal.
