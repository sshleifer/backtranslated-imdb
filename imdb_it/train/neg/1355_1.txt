I saw "What Is It?" By Crispin Glover? at the Ann Arbor film festival. Of course, the film had at least an appropriate name, because I had the distinct feeling that even the writer / director could not provide any answer. At the question and answer session after the screening, Glover said that the film was originally to be a short film to show the virtue of using actors with down syndrome. However, this is not in itself a sufficient reason to create a film. Actors are, in my opinion, constitutive elements for a broader vision - a broader vision that seemed confused at best and absent in the worst case scenario. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said he wanted to deal with taboo topics. Well, it does. But why? The film seems to have no position, no reason to deal with anything. Do you think these things should not be taboo? The film does not even give me an indicator. Taboo is not interesting for the taboo. He can't even afford to make the taboo disturb or incite at any level because he didn't make the public worry in any way. <br /> <br /> Ignoring the problems with the concept for a moment, the thing that shocked me the most was the poor quality of the film. Editing, cinematography and other technical aspects seemed to be extremely amateurish. Glover said that 125-150 thousand dollars went into the film, and I think the money should have been spent on several designers (Glover actually did some design - I know I saw at least the sound design in the credits ). The painted sets are ok (not large), but misused. The parts feel like a photographed theatrical work, which would be fine if it were intended for any kind of purpose, but in Glover's hands it is simply sloppy. Other parts are filmed as a sort of Home Movie, of inferior quality to many of the things I see first time directors on iMovie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem with "What Is It?" I can't even understand how seriously the film should be taken. There are some parts that seem like Glover is screaming at you to think seriously. In other places, it seems out of his little joke. Perhaps he meant that this was ironic, or significant in some way, but I felt that Glover could not even give himself some kind of serious attention to his film. <br /> <br /> Glover said he originally wanted to be a short film. If only it had been. At seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of images and ideas in the first twenty, and it is questionable if the ideas were formulated enough to state that they were even there for that period of time.
