I was expecting something from "K-911", ie it looked like a nice movie I could enter. I've always loved comedy films for dogs. But it looked like it was Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was rather lame and the two love interests really didn't have the chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a totally sexist vision in the film, despite the fact that the writer was not going in that direction. James really drove me crazy for more than half of the movie. The dogs were the real stars and this is sad enough that the actors shone. <br /> <br /> So I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize that it was his brother Jim who was talented, without offense, but not everyone can be their twin brothers. Don't you want Ashlee Simpson to take the same advice? : D <br /> <br /> 3/10
