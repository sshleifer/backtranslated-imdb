This is a film about animal cruelty. In the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally a horse from dead to dead IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this has his conscience spiritually cleansed from the flames of the horse's burial / burning, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. This is one of the most nauseating and muddy films I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. Like Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we should admire their spirit for finishing the race. I would like to put the producers and the director in a marathon race; I will decide when they are finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
