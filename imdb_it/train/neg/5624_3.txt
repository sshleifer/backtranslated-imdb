In his brief 40 years on Earth, the author Jack London managed to encompass all the adventure and the accident that seems possible. This 90-minute film, presumably a biography of man's life but densely fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface and remains a very mature story for a modern revisitation. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, plays London, and his performance is harsh and sympathetic at the same time. He is not the problem here. Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, who plays her future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the "base" for this film. The life of London has been divided here into a series of episodes, which the film slightly jumps through. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a welder in the Bering Sea, a gold digger in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese war ... colorful events, of course, but hardly given anything like treatment of depth. And the direction of Alfred Santell (he also directed one of Susan's first films, "Our Leading Citizen", in 1939) is rather absurd. Making things more difficult here is a poor quality DVD, with a poor-looking print source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the extras on the DVD: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, with hundreds and hundreds of color movie posters. We only hope that these films are more in the form of "Jack London"!
