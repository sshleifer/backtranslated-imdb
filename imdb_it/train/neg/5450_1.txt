An attempt so pretentious and lame for elegance. Evil screenplay and really embarrassing dialogue and acting. Truly the worst film I've ever seen (in the cinema). Nothing in my opinion saves this film from being a total disaster. I saw it when it came out in a cinema in Brighton. People were going out and there were more people chatting outside the restrooms than in the auditorium! In the end there were whistles and disdain from the scarce crowd left, which was rather sad since the relatives of one of the main actors were present and seemed really embarrassed. However, the film was so bad that I couldn't really like them. Everyone has to start somewhere and their son started his acting career with this terrible attempt at "Tarantinism done in the UK". Five years have passed, but sometimes I still feel the burning of the sad night at the cinema! This is a movie with no saving features whatsoever! I gave a 1 as 0 was not available. They should invent a "vergometro" for all those involved in this sad movie mess. I know some of them have moved on to better things, the good thing is that none of them could have sunk lower than this.
