*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Do all teen slasher films suffer from a drought of originality? It sounds terribly so. First of all, this is a noble premise that could have been used well. A young nerd refused growing up, chasing and killing all the girls who tortured him to death when he was in junior high? I can't say you have nothing to work with. But this film follows the same movements as all the other recent woodcutters. Everything, from the score to the camera angle, allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will hit. We know the model now. These stupid slasher films push the envelope of credibility more and more per minute. Let me ask you one thing: who, in their right mind, will surprise a friend of theirs in a dark and dark morgue in the middle of the night and will suddenly surprise her while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Does it make absolutely no sense? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. A good shot involves the slaughter of the character of Denise Richards. She is trapped in a pool and the killer hits her with a chainsaw. There are some nice songs on the soundtrack, including an Orgy song. The music video is contained in the special functions section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even acting is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep through their roles. Obviously, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal of the title character in "Angel". Denise Richards is a beautiful actress, though, and keeps a stone in the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is just as you would expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheese and without a good fright in sight. Don't even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
