I can't believe I've wasted time with this movie. I couldn't even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I like low-budget movies and bizarre movies but that made me bored to death. Bad deed and bad acting ruined him by being curious. You have to ask yourself what these people were thinking when they spent money producing this film. I wonder what I was thinking looking up to the end. I recommend this film to anyone. How did they release it? Was there an audience that likes this kind of movie? There must be why you can find it in almost all video stores. But why? <br /> <br /> Deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, then this is for you.
