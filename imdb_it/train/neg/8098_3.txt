This is one of the most atrocious rewrites I have ever seen. If they want to make a film with a bad story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a good book. There is almost no relationship between Wolfe's book and this film besides the title. I don't care about changes if they help a flow of stories on the screen. At least the modifications should not damage the final product. The last scene of the film is painfully unconvincing. The actors are miscible. The director and / or screenwriter obviously could not decide whether to play a lame comedy or to preach an unconvincing sermon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this movie and haven't appreciated it, try the book. If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, read the book.
