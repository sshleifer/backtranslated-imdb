I grew up in a "very Christian" family from birth. I was saved before seeing this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a group of young people from my church. This film was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 and I literally had nightmares for years. I used to lie in bed and listen to my mother's footsteps upstairs. If I hadn't heard his footsteps, I would have sneaked upstairs to make sure she wasn't kidnapped. I used to pray so intensely every night for salvation because I was terrified that Jesus would forget me. This is definitely not something I will show my children until they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
