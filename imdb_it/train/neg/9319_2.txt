I don't know what you're talking about. The first time I saw this movie with two of my friends, we couldn't stop crying. This is one of the most fun shit I've ever seen. That comment on porn is so right even though hahahaha. <br /> <br /> Yes, this film is actually the worst, but it brought tears to my eyes due to fake characters, poor dialogues and acting. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it ?! It looks like one of those movies out of my drivers and. class. The props seem to come from a high school theater show. The music seems to come from an original Nintendo game. The only thing that even came close to me scared me for this film that had a killer clown who, who is not afraid of fat, lurks clowns? hahaha if anyone ever looks at it, though, they have to look for the verbal errors of the actors like the words and some of their facial expressions. ahahaha I'm dead. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
