There really wasn't a lot of history in this film. It is freely based on the events of the first Lion King movie. It should be the way Timon and Pumbaa met through their solitude. But there's not much more. <br /> <br /> Mix some scenes from the original, then ab-lib about how this movie changed them a bit. But still, is that so? I was hoping for something a little more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with few explanations. I imagine that if I wanted to see more meerkats in the Lion King universe, then it really is. But apart from that, it gives the animators little justice. Disney should really stop these direct-to-video productions. It was really boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D-"
