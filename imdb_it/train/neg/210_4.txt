Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street has many original artists of the early Hip Hop years, but they were clearly made clear that this could be their big break, obviously for some it was nice. But if you see it as an original Hip Hop culture you're wrong. It is too much produced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather, look for the first two films I mentioned. They conveyed the determination that comes from life in the ghetto. Yes, the evaluation of this film is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even delusional. This is probably because although history, acting, dialogue and direction are all terrible, music and dance are what people love about it. I love dance but at the time I thought the electro was the death of Hip Hop (I was so happy when around 1986 a new generation of classic hip hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers , Bizmarkie to name a few), and I still don't like most of the rhythms in this movie and that's why it doesn't work for me. I mean, Wild Style doesn't have much of a story, but the music there is great and authentic. Of course the tastes are different and that's fine. But as far as I'm concerned, this movie is rubbish except for break dancing and some music so I can't rate it higher than a 4 out of ten.
