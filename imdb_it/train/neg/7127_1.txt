This film was nothing short of ugly !!! The myriad of superb machines have fallen out of favor for being featured in this LAME movie. Start with a race by L.A. in Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in a Ferrari F430. I did it in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4-cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie doesn't do justice to these machines. Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive below the speed limit with their hands at 10 and 2 o'clock. I remember seeing on the news that Eddie Griffin had brought down a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo that went to 30-40 MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> E ... director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people enjoyed orally just to break into Hollywood. He has participated in a film that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE manner. Asian women >> cheap money whores. Asian men >> losing compulsive gamblers and thugs who fight all the time. What the hell is all the fear of Asians? Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation ?? I'm so fed up with the way Hollywood ALWAYS interprets Asians in such a false and false pretext.
