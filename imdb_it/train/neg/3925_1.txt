I saw this "hot" movie when it came out in 1986. It had an X rating for a short scene involving oral sex, but it played in mainstream theaters (it was an "art" movie). Presumably it is the first film to show a respected actress in an explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> What I saw was a boring story of a high school boy (Federico Pitzalis) in love (understandably) with an older woman (Maruschka Detmers). As has been said before, Detmers is very beautiful with a good physique, but he also gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (to put it mildly) rather poor. No wonder he never made another film. And yet, despite the infamous sex scene (which is explicit but rather short), this is a boring and slow story that bored me. Detmers' good acting only contributed to a certain point. Mostly I was looking at my watch waiting patiently for it to finish. If it didn't have this sequence, this film would have been forgotten long ago. Boring and slow. You can skip this.
