What an empty and luster-free version of the classic novel. I wish people would stop joking with the classics when they clearly have no idea of ​​the true intention or point of the original. This version is no different. I heard that Ralph Fiennes' version is much worse, even though the casting of Juliette brioche like Kathy was the worst casting decision EVER ... anyway back to this version. It aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary environment and in a musical style. It happens in both but high art is nit. Vision to throw away for a rainy day maybe ... The direction was average and the editing was abysmal. Worse than old Quincy. Deepak Verma makes a big breakthrough as Hindley and is indeed one of Britain's wasted talents. Heath's part has been interpreted with great charm and conviction and I think that casting is the strength of this project. Even if a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had. It is clear that he was a rental manager and did not instill the project with the passion he deserved.
