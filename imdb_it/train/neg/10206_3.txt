From director Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw a little of this in my course of media studies, and I recognized the lead actress, so I tried it, despite the critics' judgment. The basically cool guy Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling of Half Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt of Bully) come together to kill a girl randomly to challenge themselves and see if they can get away without the police finding them. Investigating the murder is the murder detective Cassie "The Hyena" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with the new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who are rather baffled by the evidence found on the scene, eg. Unrelated Hair The plan doesn't seem to go completely well because Cassie and Sam do Richard or Justin fairly quickly as suspects, it's just a matter of whether they can influence them. Also played by Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D .. Call Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. FROM. Al Swanson. I can now see the same concept of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope with the murder for a challenge, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a good enough Bullock can save him from being boring and predictable. Adequate!
