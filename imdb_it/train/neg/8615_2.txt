This film was so bad, outdated and stupid that I had a hard time watching it until the end. I saw this Rodney in Natural Born Killers and thought it was fun to die, but this movie sucked. The "jokes" weren't funny, the actors weren't funny, nothing about it wasn't even funny. Don't waste your time on this! Only the good things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon that I'm sure made her her best, but the script was really terrible. That's why I rated it "2" instead of "1", but it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
