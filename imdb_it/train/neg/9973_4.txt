"Problem Child" is one of the most entertaining films ever made. It's not the worst (although some people don't agree with me on this), but it's not even the best. He is a diabolical 7-year-old boy who destroys the comic chaos on a childless couple (John Ritter, Amy Yasbeck) who adopts him foolishly. This movie is too stupid and unbelievable because I wouldn't buy for a second that a child can behave in a way that is not as hard as a child does in this film. It is asinine and absurd, even if I laughed several times (I really don't know why). But I can't recommend this movie. I know I'm too kind to this. If there is a positive thing about "Problem Child" is that it is better than the sequel which was simply horrible. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
