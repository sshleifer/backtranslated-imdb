Why did I lose 1.5 hours of my life watching this? Why was this film made? Why am I even commenting on this movie? <br /> <br /> A reviewer said that this film had the patience to watch and was not for everyone. I can't figure out who this movie is for. maybe after dropping a shot of acid, SOMEONE, SOMETHING could look at this and make sense of it all. It's inconsistent, it's not experimental, it's simple and simple garbage. The movie doesn't follow any plot, just when you think you have something, well ... you don't. <br /> <br /> I think the ending has brought some end to the movie (no pun), the viewer can take a look at what might have happened. I don't think I put a spoiler here, not that it would have been important. This film is another must miss in the world of filmdom.
