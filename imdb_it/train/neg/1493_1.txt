I really don't understand how people made this film and I thought it was worth all the work they gave us. Even more disconcerting are those who have watched this film without feeling robbed of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading Leviticus. <br /> <br /> First of all, surely they could have found 2 real Irish people, and some good-looking women who could express their lines better than the old porn stars consumed and scattered in this movie. Of course, the gore works - but strangely, it is not as worrying as one might think of seeing the organs torn from the (previously) hot bodies close right and left. It probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrible and inhuman acting you just want them to die of pain. <br /> <br /> So, if you don't care at all about the following: <br /> <br /> - acting (seriously, they all sucked. I never witnessed this before. EVERYONE sucked). <br /> <br /> -plot (some disgusting horror films are remotely linear, or at least surprising. the film makes no sense unless you are as scruffy as writers obviously were). <br /> <br /> - theme (Nothing to learn from this film: nothing to fear in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or to understand, or to explain to others). <br /> <br /> - soundtrack (shit, shit, shit, music as ordinary and boring as the script). <br /> <br /> - scenery (It could have been the saving grace of this film, but not ... nothing pleasant here. Even the rocks are false). <br /> <br /> So, yes. If you don't care about this, and you're just an excited teen with a bad taste for music and "women", this movie is for you. Positive comments: sometimes interesting cinematography, wasted on the other elements. Very realistic gore; again, wasted. But the intestines scene is classic. I agree with the mutant-disembowelment solves the problem of false accent.
