A film with Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, seems like a great idea. An independent film sounds even better. The studios will control less content allowing the actors, writers and director more creativity. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so bland? Ask for the powder. <br /> <br /> This film immediately takes on the fact that we are deeply involved in the characters. No one is given an adequate background, so we never know why the characters act like them. <br /> <br /> Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination, if you still have one left at the end of this film. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I went to see this movie, and that I thought it was horrible. <br /> <br /> His question: "Could not even Colin Farrell save him?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save him."
