All Hype! What better way to describe a film about people who are upset because they can't publish their film through a mainstream distributor? As a result, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the film's hype does not justify the content of the film. The story is absent and could easily be brief. The acting is poor, but the animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise, don't waste time - don't believe the clamor! However, if you have the chance to watch the movie for free, do it. Then you won't have to waste money. However, filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent miniseries. Otherwise, they are a marvel of success that has never been successful.
