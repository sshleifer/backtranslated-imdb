When I first saw a small scene in some ads, I thought the show would be fun to watch. The little robotist looks a little cute. The animation style seems familiar to some classic shows. Before the show was aired, I studied it through some sources. There, I became slightly baffled. The three children (Tommy, Gus and Lola) are expressed appropriately, but Robotboy is an exception. It would have been much nicer if he were played by a young boy. A good example is Robot Jones, a robot character from "Whatever Happened To Robot Jones?" The show is not really bad. But the way in which Robotboy is portrayed in an inappropriate way is my only criticism. So, I don't look at him much.
