The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this film is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood, whose work I admire immensely. The contacts had absolutely no chemistry. Not for a second could I believe there was something deeper than lust between them. The story was not true. Add to that drawn up conversation, tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow storyline that basically doesn't lead anywhere, and you have a real stink. Kay Lenz's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those looking for salacious dishes, but otherwise it's a colossal waste of time. My thoughts while watching the movie were that it would be better called "Cheesy".
