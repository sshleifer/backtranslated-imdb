Some very interesting photographic works and a story with a lot of potential. But it never comes together as anything more than a thesis in a film school. <br /> <br /> There are two main reasons for this. Fist, there is not a single nice character, not even a villain that we could admire for his nerve. Secondly, all the acting is horrible - even by veteran Willem DaFoe. The ham is so abundant here, you feel like you're at a picnic - but one of those miserable company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and hangover before you even stop drinking. Then eat an expired hot dog and vomit. <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm a little upset for a young director who could still go to places - like I said, camera work is pretty good. <br /> <br /> But I feel deceived - the blurb of this film suggests that we will see a "modern western", and the DVD pack contains images that suggest this, but nobody is actually connected to the film do seems to know that this is the kind of movie they should do. <br /> <br /> That betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we do not like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly confused, and ultimately we simply don't care. <br /> <br /> I extracted it from the DVD player about halfway through. but the store wouldn't give me my money back. <br /> <br /> Now it really hurts.
