An interesting idea that involves an alternative dimension within a hospital. He recalled: Stephen Kings "Langoliers", "Kingdom Hospital" and old twilight episodes. Atmospheric, the set up was great. There have also been very clever moments in the "time loop" that always have that name as a head-melt. The story contained many vague references that led me to believe that all the resulting strangeness of time flowing / ghosts / a strange bat-winged demon and a rather ghoul thing with a rather silly heavy metal would be explained. AND THAT was the fact that Dark Floors had disappointed me. Based on my vision, the film does not provide EXPLANATIONS on what is behind the events. While, we always expect some ambiguity / welcome in this type of film. The dark floors have led to new heights of vagueness. I don't expect things to close in a nice ribbon, but I shouldn't even hear "Eh? ... is that so? ... have I made a dosage? Maybe I skipped the chapter by mistake jumping?" Dark Floors left me with a deep unsatisfactory suspicion that "it was all a dream" and it's a shame because until the very end I was very much on board and I was enjoying the movie.
