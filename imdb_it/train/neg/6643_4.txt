Terminus Paradis was exceptional, but "Niki ardelean" comes too late. We already have enough and we want something new. <br /> <br /> Great directors should have no problem seeing beyond their time, not behind. Why do people see Romania only as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We are just born not reincarnated, and no one gives us more of the old times. Most people don't remember or don't want to remember, and the new generation of movie consumers doesn't understand a little. This should be the first day of the Romanian film not the final song - priveghi! Perhaps the younger directors should make the move.
