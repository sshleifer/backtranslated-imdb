This film creates a thin line between satire and nonsense. While a system of bridges that has no rules can promote marital harmony, it certainly cannot promote the winning bridge, so satire did not work for me. But there were some elements that I still found amusing, especially with the big meeting between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk towards the end of the film. It is treated as a championship boxing match. Not only does the competition arena unfold in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee poised between competitors, and the radio station Roscoe Karns offers non-stop chatter about events. At a certain point he also notes "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if the offer of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for all this, a common occurrence for championship boxing matches. This parody worked very well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few actors provide the comedy needed to support satire. Paul Lukas does not have much talent for comedy and is mixed; the beautiful Loretta Young and the usual comedian Frank McHugh did not have enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the beginning of the film, but practically disappears from then on. What a waste of talent!
