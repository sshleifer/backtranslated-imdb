There is almost nothing to recommend this film. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and can actually act, even if his role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately the rest of the cast goes from bad to mediocre. In many films like this, someone will shine through the material and take note of it for future reference. I don't have this luck here. Creature Unknown "a monster-on-the-loose flick clich√© with kids being thrown down one after another. The monster is a man in a rubber suit who remembers the times of Paul Blaisdell. So bad it's okay! show is so ugly that it is ugly. A little humor could have made it more enjoyable, but everyone plays the deadly boring material, straight up, in the end there is one or two, but then you will not be interested more.
