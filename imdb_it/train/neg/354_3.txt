Watch carefully the wonderful assortment of talents put together to make this film: Connery, Fishburne, Capshaw, Harris, Underwood, Beatty, Thigpen, even cameos by Slezak, Lange and Plimpton. In turn, they demonstrate the adage that a good cast cannot save a bad script. The plot requires so many leaps of faith from the public that its implausibility should have exceeded even Hollywood standards. It is not particularly original, and the "turns" are decidedly cruel.
