Woody Allen has made some of the most beautiful comedies ever and would seriously consider the idea that Annie Hall is the greatest film of all time, but if I think about it I will probably think of one or two that are better, but it would be difficult. He obviously had some movies that aren't good enough, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he never had a bad film like Melinda and Melinda. He's not so tired and not so funny, his films are usually witty and funny but how did it happen, is he still our good old Woody? The plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together. Two are game writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of his. It's about a young woman who breaks into an unexpected dinner. We never hear the rest because the two plays begin to discuss whether it would make a comedy or a better tragedy. When we begin to see the two points of view. Both are centered on this woman named Melinda who is having problems with both the drug and her ex-husband. In the tragedy she is an old friend from the family who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old home door of her best friends for no apparent reason. The comedy talks about Melida coming across dinner after taking 28 sleeping pills. Both go into a wild whirlwind of events that never really make sense or interlock, or that make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some nice performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they can't make it. They don't prevent it from sinking deeper than most other films this year.
