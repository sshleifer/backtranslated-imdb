This typical Bollywood melodramatic film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the acting is exaggerated and seems poor. The only reasons to watch this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain on the legendary Meena Kumari. Watching the actress, who was sick during filming and who would have drunk to death until she was 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same charm of seeing a train crash. Her ex-husband, Amrohi, has written and directed, but does not have the competence to perform both tasks well. Bollywood has produced much better films.
