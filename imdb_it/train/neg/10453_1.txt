This film deserves more than a 1. But I give a shit because so many nasty fan fans have given a 10 and got a score that will take him to the top 100. Seriously it's not so good, it's not so bad. It's a stupid cult classic with so many nerd fan fans that it's ridiculous. These are the types that probably still laugh at Chuck Norris' jokes and continue to say "I'm rick james b! Tch". It doesn't matter how old he is or becomes boring. I'm afraid of having to hear "I'm tired of the MFn snakes on this MFn plane" months from idiots trying to be funny. His crap shit acting plot etc. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you still have to admit it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Wait for the Marino movie with John Cena if you want to see a real movie
