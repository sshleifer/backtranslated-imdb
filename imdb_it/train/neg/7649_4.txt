Joyce Reynolds seems a bit too big for the role of Janie, a sixteen-year-old girl in little America, who sends her boyfriend to safety for a visiting soldier and ends up on the cover of Life magazine (smoking at a covered party) all in the same week! Endless barrier of witty jokes, put-downs, bull talk and unhealthy business like Janie's little sister who corrupts family members, Hattie McDaniel (like the maid) constantly told after a sassy girl, Janie's mother involved with the Red Cross, and Janie's father who is trying to write an editorial on problems with today's teenagers (like parents, Edward Arnold and the tireless and talkative Ann Harding make an unlikely pair, even for 1944: it seems unable to help conceive a child much less by raising two). Nominated for an Academy Award (!) For the editing of Owen Marks, Warner Bros. followed him in 1946 with "Janie Gets Married". Reynolds must have passed his co-horts by then - was replaced by Joan Leslie. * 1/2 from ****
