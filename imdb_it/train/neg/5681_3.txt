After seeing and loving Postal (yes, I actually loved Postal), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and chose Seed because I happened to stumble on it in a local DVD store and it should be one of the his best films. <br /> <br /> While the first 10-15 minutes of the film were very promising and seemed the beginning of a not too traditional psychological thriller, it soon went downhill from there and eventually degraded itself into one of the most generic slasher movies I've seen so far, including a huge amount of holes in the plot, unrealistic emotional responses and comparable acting. It seems that Boll did his best to invent a decent plot, but he gave up after a while. Maybe he should stick to the play ?! The few positive things about this film are that it manages to create a disturbing atmosphere, that the special effects are better than I expected and the soundtrack goes well with the general atmosphere, but the unbalanced rhythm of this film combined with the total its generic nature means that the last half hour is rather boring to look at, which has completely ruined my experience. There are shocking scenes very well done, but they seem to be there only for the value of the shock. And let's not forget that working with the camera was quite sickening at times. I hope Uwe Boll can one day learn what makes a good movie, because from a lot of horrible movies it seems to make a decent film from time to time. The seed is not one of those.
