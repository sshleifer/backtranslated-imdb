This was a waste of time. Danger: if you look at it you will be tempted to tear your DVD off the wall and lift it through the window. <br /> <br /> An amateur production: a terrible, repetitive, vacuous dialogue; thin line plot; wood shows; Lucy Lawless has been pathetically portrayed. <br /> <br /> Seriously imperfect story, absolutely incredible characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. they are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins. <br /> <br /> The "twist" plot? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like looking at a train going down the prairie in the middle of the day. It doesn't even resolve properly. Evil is not punished for the original crime. <br /> <br /> Please, please, please - do not watch it even if it is free and the only other choice is to go to a synagogue.
