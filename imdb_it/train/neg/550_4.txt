After the superb AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a Gujarati comedy, comes with WAQT which also looks like a theatrical game <br /> <br /> In theatrical performances, we have characters that scream, which they also move the same here <br /> <br /> The first half shows Amitabh who is almost joking with the 40-year-old Akshay Kumar who behaves too much like a little nerd <br /> <br /> The film has a good message on how not to ruin your child but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants to make Akki accountable is absolutely false <br /> <br /> Also his reason for hiding his illness, his runnign from the hospital and the speech melodramatic of Akki is a postponement <br /> <br /> Some emotions I touch you but most is too exaggerated <br /> <br /> The comedy of Rajpal is hilarious but too tense in the second part <br /> < br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is too exaggerated even if some scenes are good Music it's okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh takes the lead in the first half among the actors, but he is superb in the emotional scenes. Akshay Kumar also does his part well, but he seems humbly at ease. Rajpal is a culminating moment, it makes you laugh without exaggerating and only its presence and its stupid behavior and impassive humor is a revolt Boman is good in some comic parts but too noisy in places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do , this is his last film with Akki so far Shefali is fantastic even though he looks too young for Bachchan
