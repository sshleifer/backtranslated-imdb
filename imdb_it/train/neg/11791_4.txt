I don't understand this. The film obviously has a good budget. He has good cinematography. He has a good rhythm, good editing and also good direction. Then WHY OH WHY they didn't hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so that it wouldn't be so damn mischievous and WHY OH WHY they hired such nasty actors who can't make their way from a paper bag? This movie could have been good. In most cases, it reads well and feels good but in the end you understand that the film was not good at all. <br /> <br /> So I'd say it's a good production but a bad movie. Too bad indeed. <br /> <br /> And eels? Come on, really!
