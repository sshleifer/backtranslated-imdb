I had to leave the theater. After an hour, all I was seeing were people who betrayed their wives, took slaves like dogs in a furrow, and used f-word as a diabetic with Equal. <br /> <br /> No thanks. <br /> <br /> It was particularly frustrating because the film could have done a lot. Any character could have been quite interesting if they had given him more to do than fornicate, talk about it and swear between them. <br /> <br /> The few times it seemed they were going to be some kind of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. The development of the plot in the first hour can be summarized as 1) several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees the murder scene 3) Vinnie stares at the Atlantic / East / Hudson River 4) Vinnie betrays his wife, and 5) Joey (the most sympathetic character in the show) is kicked out of his parents' home. Besides, I couldn't wait to see. <br /> <br /> The photography and the interaction between the characters were excellent, but there was NOTHING to do for them. The flood of sex and vulgarity was not worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen. <br /> <br /> Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption. Or one is a better study in community and interpersonal relationships.
