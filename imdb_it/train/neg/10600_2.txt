I'll be honest The only reason I saw this on TV is that it's at the bottom of IMDb. And now, I wonder if the hour and a half of my life was really worth another "check" on that same list. > <br /> Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, who finds himself in a big fight with Universal Soldiers after the main computer has thrown a 'HAL' to defend itself. And yes, after all the compulsory explosions, shootings and chases, he is the last one standing. Combined with terrible acting and a boring attitude, it ensures that the place on the infamous list is right. <br /> <br /> Only for idiots like me who want to see that complete list. 2/10.
