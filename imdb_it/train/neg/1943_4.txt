What a disappointment! This started with an intriguing mystery and interesting characters. Actually, he moved at the speed of a snail, but I was still caught and kept looking. <br /> <br /> David Morrissey always has good value and Suranne Jones was a good protagonist. The Muslim aspects were very interesting. We have been teased by possible terrorist connections. <br /> <br /> But then the character of Morrissey was killed and all the air left the ball. The last episode was boring, boring, boring. The whole thing turned out to be a very small beer and the denouement was incredibly weak. <br /> <br /> Five hours of my life for that? My advice: look at the dry paint instead.
