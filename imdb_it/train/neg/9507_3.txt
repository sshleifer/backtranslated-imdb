I always feel frustrated by films that have obviously been written by a genre. Especially when obviously they don't do enough research to find out when something doesn't just sound real, but sounds blatantly false. <br /> <br /> The scene I'm remembering is the one in the bathroom where Jack tells his football teammates that he got Diane pregnant. In no way, shape or form, a boy would ever cheer up another boy to have a pregnant girl in high school. They could cheer on the guy who has sex with the sexy cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first soccer team to know it wouldn't be in a urinal. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that this film hadn't done it. It takes it so seriously, and it wasn't terribly bad, but come on!
