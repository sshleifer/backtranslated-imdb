I was a passionate spectator until I spent long cold hours building a home for the White Family, only to be disgusted to see the house a year later. All the beautiful rocky landscape was removed, the beautiful rock sidewalk and the front fountain were removed, all the pines and pecan trees in the front were felled, the irrigation system was torn away. Now it looks like a disaster area. They don't even live there ... they live "in the city" and only go out for the weekend. It hurts me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma have given to these people and to see the result. The story we all saw on TV was not completely the truth ... don't believe everything you see and hear.
