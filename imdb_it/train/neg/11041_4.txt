The show is average. It doesn't make me laugh particularly. However, I think Courtney really does lower it. You don't look natural. You have these three ways of talking, all robotic. He speaks quietly (without intonation), speaks normally (without intonation), or does that thing in which he starts speaking normally, and begins to scream gradually. However, his screams are like "let's pretend to scream because I shouldn't be too loud on the set". <br /> <br /> You are constantly aware of being this nice actress who does this fun thing. It's annoying. You can't really get his personality, because he doesn't really produce emotions and he doesn't get angry. She has this husband, who is doing all these stupid things, and there is no reaction from him. Very dry and simple acting.
