I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave the line for 10). If a film does not go well in the first 5 or 10 minutes it will probably never improve. I have yet to try any film that has been shown to challenge this theory. Dan in Real Life is absolutely no exception. I was looking at this turkey and I thought; wow, this is not funny, not moving, not sad, and I don't like characters at all. <br /> <br /> The story of a councilor of advice / widower who raises three young daughters, who falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. I suppose the slogan would be "advice columnist who could use the advice"? I do not know. The character of Dans in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. I guess it's irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in a kind of family retreat, which seems very sweet, and a potential fodder for a good comedy, plot ... no one ever emerges. Central history is basically how she loves this woman, but she can't have it. Anyone with a pulse will understand that in the end he will take it, but you will have to suffer through dialogues of TV movie "love killers" painfully little funny, trivial, to get to the inevitable happy ending. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
