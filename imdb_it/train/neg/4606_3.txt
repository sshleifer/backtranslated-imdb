This film was an attempt to go to places where most don't and perhaps we shouldn't venture into it. It was a process similar to the bizarre perspective of the casuistry that was given to us in The Cell, although it was not so thorough and well represented. The plot is built simply with an initial campy feel to it. Then, when the film takes its supposed "dramatic" turn, the plot crumbles over which few legs it had to endure in the first place. <br /> <br /> Basically the idea is that of a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. He assumes the role of a hit man, killing a city accountant. Then he is not paid for his work but is tortured for several days because he devised the "brilliant" idea of ​​trying to use a backup file he had as a lever for payment. This idiotic move in trying to force them to pay it backfires while it is horribly and endlessly abused. He starts to go crazy (some very disturbing scenes). Then, thinking he paid for his sins and can start over, visit the wife (Kari Wuhrer) of the man who killed and wins his affections. Shortly after he discovers who he is, the tragedy strikes and revenge sweeps the air while the boy chases his torturers (Daniel Baldwin, George Wendt, Vernon Wells) for their previous "kindness". <br /> <br /> I have to ask though, what is it with Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore movies? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything you've published lately has been in this genre. Sure, I liked it in "Eight-Legged Freaks" and she was fine in "Anaconda". But despite all its obvious beauty and charm (wow, it's sexy!), It can behave much better and choose better roles. Or maybe, I was wrong and this is just a misunderstanding. For all you guys out there, you get to see the "complete monty" of her in this movie, even though it's rather bizarre and short lived. I almost felt like he had made a soft-porn after seeing this movie (something not a stranger to Kari's career). The simulation of sex is such as to force you to ask yourself what really happens during filming. <br /> <br /> In any case, I will say that there is good acting. Just don't expect much from Daniel Balwin, whose career seems destined forever to conquer his brother Alex. The film brought out some of the greats of the past, George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Weird Science). Above all, Chris McKenna does the best job in the lead role, Sean Crawley. His little acting experience and his credible nature as a naive young man, bring some elements of substance into the film. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to go out of my way for this. If you're bored and you're tired of the same old episodes of "The Hitchhiker", then I might advise you to watch it. <br /> <br /> And Kari, please start acting in some better movies!
