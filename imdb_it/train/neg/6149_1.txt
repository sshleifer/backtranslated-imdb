I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I have completely erased his work. Having, unfortunately, faced Lucas at a young age, Howard is now involved in so many of Lucas' traits. How else do you explain his fury of disasters? His only useful film, of course, was 'Salice'. Everything else, including this one, is too dependent on superficial stuff. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> It can't even have a semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard has stuck with his Spielbergian knockoff qualities that will soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old adage: "love conquers all, even illness". Too bad for Howard that Lynch has already passed the entire subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than that. Ron even feeds on the possibilities offered by imagined realities. <br /> <br /> The track of Howard's comments is simply horrible. Don't even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Cinematic Dud
