Feh. This film started off in an interesting way, but quickly moved the range from confusing to boring. The confusing parts happened mainly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that it is difficult to say what is happening in the first twenty minutes or so. The boring arrives later, with a lukewarm love story between the two living beings (both pussano). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the liveliest person in the film, which is sad. If the rest of the cast had lived up to its caliber, the film could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the plot becomes really interesting for a while, since it seems that the crazy mother of the sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from death, with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all the other dead would come back as well, take a solid shape human and most likely start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystic Night of the Living Dead. But this does not occur. Although this hairy and unwashed priest with a small basket tied to his head tells uninteresting young people that this will happen if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person to manifest is her daughter. No rising mass of the dead, no walking corps of corpses, nothing. The priest simply returns the spirit of the girl to the land of the dead, taking with him the casual taste of a boyfriend, while she crushed his spine like a fragile peanut (at that point I was tempted to loudly cheer, since this is the idiot went to kiss and caress the DEAD girl, ewwww !!!). The sucker Robitussen, the best friend without a spine, has a long introspective blow at the end while leaving the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real anxiety, which the Japanese tend to do much better than American filmmakers with their emphasis on exaggerated face make-up, without screaming mimosas. I was very disappointed.
