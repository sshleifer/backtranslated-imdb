In the glory days of the 90s (the god rests his soul) it is possible to activate the great Comedy Central at any time of the day and see the greatest show of sketch comedies of all times Saturday Night Live. Whpat was a glorious show, whether it was the original Non-Ready-for-Primetime Players or the second golden age of SNL with the greats - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then, everything went to hell. I was exposed for the first time at MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I passed the shock. How can such a terrible sight prevail for so long? There are so many horrible flaws. I suppose I'll start with writing. Writing, for the most part, is terrible. It is nothing but the humor of the kindergarten bathroom. The cast, for the most part, is without talent. There are some sketches that I enjoyed, like some of Mrs. Swan and Stuart, and there are some talents on the show like the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, not just a comedian. Even if there are a few scattered moments, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible crap populated by stuttering idiots. Miss this.
