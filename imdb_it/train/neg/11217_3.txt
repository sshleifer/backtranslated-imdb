So my wife and I have just finished, despite several threats from both to deactivate it. For the most part boredom was the worst part of this film, there was only little excitement. The acting was atrocious, to the point that we actually chuckled several times during some of the worst scenes (the church woman for example). The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin, although instead of sending useful information she concentrated on trying to scare her to death instead of looking a lot like the Ring. Rather, get the police involved - I'm sure the ear plugs they found would have DNA everywhere - she instead devises a horrible plan to "catch" the man who covered her sister's accidental death. I call it a horrible plan because in the end she lets him kill her too, which then the film vanishes in black. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad ending.
