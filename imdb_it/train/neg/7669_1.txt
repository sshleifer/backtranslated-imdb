This film manages to be one of the most unique films you've seen. However this stems from the fact that you cannot make the head or the tail of this mess. It almost seems like a series of challenges set to determine whether or not you are willing to leave the movie and give up the money you just paid. If you don't want to feel offended, you will sit through this horrible film and develop a real sense of pity for the actors involved, everyone has seen better days, but then you realize that in reality a lot of money has been paid to do this and you'll lose pity for them just like you've already done for the movie. I can't go far enough on this horrible movie, it's almost something that Ed Wood would have done and in that case it would surely be his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> To start you are forced to sit down by opening dialogues like those you've never seen / heard, this thing must last five minutes. Furthermore, it is narrated to suggest that the user cannot read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and the barrage of terrible lines gets under way, it's like he's working exclusively to get lines on the film's tag line. Soon we meet Stephen Dorff, who usually amuses me) and does his best not to drown in this, but in the end he does. Then comes the last insult, Tara Reid who plays an intelligent role, oh help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actress and, somehow, she continually gets roles in the movies, in my opinion though she should stick to the American pie type films. <br /> <br /> All in all you might want to see all this alone when it comes out on video, I know I enjoyed it, I mean to be honest here, sometimes it's comforting to reveal the shortcomings of others.
