I work as a concierge at a Washington DC hotel and I stood up to it, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply don't go around with our pockets full of theater tickets and $ 100 notes! # 2 If I ever allowed someone to use a room for a bit of "afternoon delight", I would be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very defined ethical and conduct standards that we take seriously. # 3 Equally false was the concept, at the end of the film, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and handing it to some other employee - we were earning those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge that you can wear their. There is a whole application and control process to become part of our organization. <br /> <br /> This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a goalkeeper as nothing more than a mercenary to eradicate money. In short it does a bad service to our organization. I welcome any comments.
