I'm Irish and I've been living in Denmark for a while, so I couldn't wait to go home last week, so I could see the Intermission. And I will continue to record as mentioned: <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS NOT FANTASTIC. <br /> <br /> Something like "The most fertile man in Ireland" is not bad at all, but it certainly doesn't hold up there with other Irish films like The Commitments, I Went Down or Michael Collins. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny, such as Colarda Meaneys in American style. But the film itself is completely wrong. The camera bounce and the constant zoom-in, zoom-out try to give the film a sharp look as if it were a gritty drama. But it is not. This is an Irish Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and should be filmed this way. It should have a smooth movement from one shot to another. The film seems a little neglected and put together. <br /> <br /> The shows are in place, given the terrible script. A friend of mine told me it was like they had followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week. It gives a decent show like a Dublin Dirtbag, but in no way comparable to his performances in Minority Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was Dierdre O'Kane, who plays a sexually frustrated middle-aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank's husband for a younger woman. I think she should leave her divine position and focus more on her acting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it does not in any way live up to the expectations expressed by the Irish press or deserve to be considered one of the best Irish films ever. <br /> <br /> I expect a negative reaction from these comments because most of the people I spoke to told me it was great. But before answering, ask yourself: do you think so much about this film if it was set in England or America?
