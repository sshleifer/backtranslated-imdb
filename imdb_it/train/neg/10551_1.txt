Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a boy who wanders the earth performing self-mutilation shows as a way to face his violent childhood. I use the word "apparently" because without listening to the comment by director Andy Copp (which I didn't have at my disposal) or reading the film before watching, the spectators don't have the slightest idea what it is. br /> <br /> Gorehound and extreme film fans can be lured to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of some tough splatter scenes and disturbing real-life movies, but unless they're also pretentious, sore head that induces, experimental art cinema, will find this a real effort to sit. <br /> <br /> 82 minutes of ugly images accompanied by disharmonious sounds, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogues, this shockingly horrible drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you still have all the marbles, you will pass this garbage and look instead at something decent (I looked at the whole thing, but I am well aware that I am completely barking!).
