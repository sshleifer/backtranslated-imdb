What a waste of cast. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most disappointing films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Usually Roger Ebert does not disappoint me, but I feel betrayed after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> The only thrill is to see Elizabeth's banks in her bra. This is an unpleasant statement about this film. He had so many promises, but it was like a wet disguise dressing up. <br /> <br /> This is a self-absorbing tripe. <br /> <br /> I can't express my bitterness deeply enough for sitting in this film and I hope I can warn you of the same disappointment.
