One of the previous reviewers wrote that there seemed to be no middle ground for the Love Story opinions; one loved it or hated it. But there seems to be a noticeable distribution of opinions across the scale of 1 to 10. For me, this film got a score of 4. There are some beautiful scenes and places, and Ray Milland turns into a fabulous job as Oliver's father . But the film did not do a particularly compelling job in telling its story, and the story was not so unique as to merit multiple visions, at least, not for me. I could be a little snobbish, but I tend to avoid the movies with Ryan O'Neal - I haven't seen Barry Lyndon yet - because most of them, but not all, are ruined for me by his presence. The only exception is What's Up, Doc?, In which its direct performance is the perfect underlining for the protagonist of Barbra Streisand's goofball - and, not surprisingly, makes a good choice in Love Story! McGraw and O'Neal tend to attack their lines rather than recite them. <br /> <br /> This film is noteworthy for the start of a beautiful career: it was the first Tommy Lee Jones film.
