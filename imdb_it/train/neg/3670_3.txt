For a science fiction movie to work well it must be really original or very interesting. This film is neither one nor the other. Of course, there is a pseudo-original twist as the boy kills people because of a toxin and not because of an illness, but this is a very minor turnaround. There is the corner of the government conspiracy, the Crusader protagonist who has personal experience ... <br /> <br /> And a real drawback of this film is that the contaminated man has no pathos. Even if the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied, he is not. Without pity the film is useless. The other characters are cutters so ridiculous. The subplots are twisted and annoying. And the saddest thing is that the film is too flat to be even appreciated as a fake material. Make the movie a short 45 minutes and it might be worth watching.
