SPOILERS WORLDWIDE: <br /> <br /> The Gettaway is primarily an action movie. And what action is there to do !! Shootout, chases, dumpsters and much more. The protagonists are Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I didn't see the original, but I really didn't care about this at all, even though Bassenger and Baldwin have a nice chemical screen. But the film itself didn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> The Gettaway has become really boring very quickly. The plot is obscured by one combat after another and while violence continues to accumulate, Bassenger and Baldwin maintain their magnificent appearance regardless of the dangers in which they find themselves. In fact, by the end of the film they seem to be BETTER beginning. I don't think Bassenger's eye make-up moves just once during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, certainly not, but it is not very nice and unless you are an action film purist I can't really see enjoying this movie because here there isn't much. Even the Gettaway is not terribly original, and goes from unnecessarily brutal to rather boring. I think it could have been better. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin offer OK performances, but they don't have much to do but be chased and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it becomes stale. I didn't like this very much.
