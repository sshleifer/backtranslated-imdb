A particularly vilified example of Italian cult cinema with an absurd title to use (if anything, altering THE BRAND OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), This hybrid of Gothic Horror and Yellow (with a strong dose of Erotica ) only builds a sort of flat atmosphere in all ?? actually combined with a treatment that is decidedly terrible! Here, we have the usual group of people (an acting company) stuck on an island (to which they have been invited by a Count since he fell in love with the protagonist, a dead man for his missing husband)! The characters are practically stereotypes: middle-aged but truculent hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history bears more than his share of violent tragedy), a shy heroine, a sloppy companion (remembering Mae West and emerging the more annoying than a lot!), a mild but devoted stage manager (forever scolded by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once , enters into action, if you know what I mean), an envious maid (the nominal star Femi Benussi however, for what it's worth, this really is a piece of ensemble), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable maid, etc. . While the film is not meant to be unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, the snail rhythm, the poor production (with scenes depicting the stormy sea raised by a black and white film!) And the fact that the murders occur only within the final half hour does not help things. Furthermore, the soundtrack by Marcello Giombini, however pleasant in itself, appears out of the circumstances as incongruously modern; That said, the revelation turns out to be surprisingly elaborate (considering that in this case there is certainly no shortage of suspects).
