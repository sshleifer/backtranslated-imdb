ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY <br /> <br /> Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Bland, soap-dramatization of the rise and the fall of the first American female television actress. With a closer script and direction - and a better cast - this may have passed the rally, but the frail story wasn't really worth it. A good documentary on the subject may have been the best way to go. Typically high production values ​​in the mode of a TV movie film transporter, but it's all as superficial as the old fluff and just as engaging.
