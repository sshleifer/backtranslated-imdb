In a nutshell: this is a romantic cookie-cutter comedy that really WANTS to TRY to be something more. She wants to be Harold and Maude, Annie Hall, The Graduate. He wants to be deep and human. It has interesting shots, lights, music, editing, which give the feeling of an important film. Dialogue is smart - sometimes. There are some moments of "loud laughter". <br /> <br /> But here's what ultimately prevents it from being anything more than a terrific late-night, full-time flight: <br /> <br /> 1. David Schwimmer - how many times the Is Joe's puppy sad-sack staring into space with his jaw open before it starts to get annoying? Maybe some smear would have helped. <br /> <br /> 2. Gwenneth Paltrow - she's really flat here and not just in the chest. Her role should be this lively, kind and caring girl, who continues to be in wrong situations, is very confused as a result, which is why a loser with a sad bag like Schwimmer has some chance with her. But Gwenneth sounds very boring. Combine this with the drool-face with a puppy dog ​​(above) and you have little chemistry to cure. <br /> <br /> (I continued to imagine someone else in this role - Kate Hudson for example.) <Br /> <br /> 3. The script and the plot - the things that happen simply don't sound real; all the problems end with such a neat and neat bow that it looks like a whistle and the writers have just said "oops, it's time to conclude, I have a train to take!" So they pulled out the Hollywood recipe book, checked all the boxes and went home.
