I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes would not work for Gilligan's island. If this had gone to the series, would they have been beaten on Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven, just to suggest to Adolf the type that seats 50? Another post compared this show with I love Lucy. The problem is that Lucille Ball was a genius in physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was simply badly done and an insult to my intelligence. <br /> <br /> After the damage the Nazis did to England and the number of people killed, I thought the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would have seemed repulsive and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episode were produced
