In 1985 I discovered this thing (I can't even call it a movie) by cable. I was in college and was with a high school friend whose hormones were going out of control. I knew immediately that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a group of old people hiring some young boys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The abundant female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while - but he too was bored after 30 minutes. Remember - this was a SCHOOL CHILD! This was again before nudity was so easy to get from the Internet and so on. We continued to watch hoping for something interesting or fun but it never happened. The funniest thing was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted that this movie was crap! (A poster had a fictitious review that said, "This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead has shown talent and has actually embarked on a career in the industry. T & a no-budget and boring. Salta.
