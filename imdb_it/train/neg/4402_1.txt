I usually love lesbian movies even when they are not very good. I'm biased, I guess! <br /> <br /> But this is just the hole. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this film is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between pouting and becoming tall / stoned / fainting on any drug or alcohol is at hand, and Ella inexplicably puts this abominable behavior back through the entire movie. At no time did we give an idea of ​​why this is so, or why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If there had been at least some sort of closure in the (potentially romantic? 'Tso also!) relationship between the two, there could have been some sort of satisfaction. But even if Annamarie at one point asks Ella "why do you love me?" She doesn't even recognize him. It is never really clear if this is something more than a lesbian (badly educated) on a boring road trip with a heterosexual woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey, which could have been lively and informative, is instead flat, boring and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it wasn't intentional. Women travel in a Ford two-seater coupe with a medium-sized trunk. And yet, when they camp, they have a huge tent, a crib, a sleeping bag and even a table, a chair and a typewriter! Moreover, when they board a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably their own, presumably also carried in the trunk of little Ford! <br /> <br /> And through the whole movie, we never see a service station, or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gas. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel? <br /> <br /> There can't be too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there are many that are better than that, and very few are worse. Leave this in the rack.
