This film is so ugly - dialogues, stories, actors and actresses - everything! - that it is difficult to imagine that we will see a worse film this year or in later years. "Love's Brother" (set in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but simple clich√©s about Italian culture to offer, and it is quite clear that even Italians from and to Italy speak English in the film. The message of the movie - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry nice people - it's really annoying. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good at films like "Suburbia" or "Lost in Translation", but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Trash like basket!
