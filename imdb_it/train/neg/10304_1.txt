here, let me shake hands on the keyboard, I'll tell you what salad she's about to order. over and over again, it works like a charm: it's a genius, how does it do? my crap drives me crazy if I can pass this show even when I'm scanning the channels, I have to be very careful (these days it's useful too often, so I don't need it to break on idiotic bullshit like this ... be careful with that TV remote!). should this be fascist propaganda to make people believe in an invisible realm of superb control and mastery? or what? why does it exist ?? <br /> <br /> this is the silliest show, completely unbelievable and artificial, and I can't understand why it's still on the air. so geeks can give SO much more difficult shows (Sarah Connor Chronicles, True Blood), but give this senseless drivel a pass. shows like Firefly (if there were any) go away after a season, but stuff like that that doesn't make logical sense continues to march. yeccch.
