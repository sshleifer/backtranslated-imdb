And the Oscar for the most underrated classic horror actor goes to Dwight Frye. Seriously his name should be declared with the same amazement as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to watch this movie. Dwight gave this misfit a little more than slightly disturbed a lovable but disturbing demeanor that led you to hope for a wider role in the whole film. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being myself in the medical profession I must congratulate the expert execution of a hypochondriac prone to self-pity. Although other "medical errors" gave a brief laugh, especially when the good doctor tastes his medical colleagues ... "Well, keep giving it to him" Unfortunately these 2 exceptional performances did not keep me awake during 3 attempts to sit through this unbearable slow movie. The plot is predictable with only a few minor twists. Filming while pulling out a legitimate ghostly atmosphere was more productive in making me yawn - yes, you can use too much shade. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - look this time to see Frye and Eburne - but only when you are fully awake and caffeinated.
