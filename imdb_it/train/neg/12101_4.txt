I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I didn't care about his delivery. He has just come out of an asshole in a poorly conceived and elaborate advertising campaign. Edit cuts galore, etc ... The camera would focus on him, and you would see 2 or 3 edit cuts only during a minute or two of dialogue. Add the constant microphones of the shot, which is a no-no movie. <br /> <br /> This documentary hits a subject with so many points of view, so many interesting stories, that the film is made so easily. Choosing religious fanatics is like choosing the retarded boy. It's so easy it's just wrong. I mean, how hard is it to make these people look like crazy people? To make them contradictory, simply let them recite more than one verse or two. I like it when he jumped among people of the same religion and showed them completely at odds with themselves. I think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist that talks about brain activity was never developed. Could it have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious crises compared to drugs, or sex, or ???? He could have played more on the women who rejoiced for the work of the Passion that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. Others may have entered the story of John Smith, the Mormon founder who had a rather colorful past. Deepen the science v.s. religion. One is a very methodical and very strict process to increase confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom up, a new layer on top of a more tried layer. A huge burden of proof is required at every stage of the journey. The other starts at the top and descends with unquestionable statements. Is that so, why good? I said it. <br /> <br /> Done right? Would I say turn it into an original HBO series ?? hit a different religion every week. <br /> <br /> It was a glance on one thing. I must have been blind. Good old G. W.Bush ... no wonder he was elected. He had a religious majority. And well ... now that it's the blind leading the blind. <br /> <br /> Bill Moyer .. Well .. what can I expect from a boy who delivers Sutra to Newport beach?
