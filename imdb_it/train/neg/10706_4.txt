Wow and I thought any Steven Segal movie was bad. Whenever I thought the movie couldn't get worse, it turned out to be wrong. The story was good but the actors couldn't take it forward. Moreover, they have made many mistakes about how adequate archaeological excavations are made. For example, do not manage artifacts until they are cataloged and accounted for. The biggest crime in the cast was the archaeologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting made the film less realistic than it already was. The whole concept of the Knights Templar who have been underground these years has seemed rather stupid to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and stuff, so it seems almost depressing. I thought the characters weren't explained well enough. You haven't found much background and this has made it more difficult to relate to them.
