Clearly eliminates Ringu of Hideo Nakata (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with scents of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but atrociously made blood (a green corpse with red eyes! ?) weak story, and a weak topic (I find it very difficult to find a scary illustrative message). There were two moments in this film that made me shudder, both with an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi, this since 1999) made me tingle for hours after seeing it, and all the movies that this one steals actually they were scary, I can't see this movie as anything other than a sell-out to the western popularity of the great Japanese horror movies. Two out of ten.
