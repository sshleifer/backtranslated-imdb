Hollywood has always had problems coming to terms with a "religious framework". Strange Cargo proves to be no exception. Although you use the talents of a superb cast and produced on a high budget, with an appropriately moody photograph by Robert Planck, the film unpleasantly fails on the credibility score. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that the sudden intrusion of fantasy elements disrupts the viewer's involvement in the action and the fate of the characters. I found it difficult to sit still through all the invented metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and it is impossible to accept the smug figure of Ian Hunter, in a bath of light, like a figure of Christ. And the Boston, Detroit and Providence censors at least agreed with me. The film was banned. Few viewers in Boston / Detroit / Providence, if there are any, complained or traveled to other cities because it was obvious from the trailer that Gable and Crawford had somehow been involved in a "message image". He flopped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the film enjoyed a revival on TV. A domestic atmosphere seems to make the allegory of the film more receptive to viewers. However, despite its growing reputation as a strange or unusual film, the plot of this Strange Cargo runs along predictable and highly moralistic lines that will have no one to guess how the main characters will end up dealing with destiny.
