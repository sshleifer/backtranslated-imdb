I don't know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry's cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan, he sees Jerry leaving Tom behind for an adventure in New York, and as far as I'm concerned, this definitely suffers from a lack of a cat! <br /> <br /> As magical as Jerry's exploration of 'Big Apple could be for other T & J fans who have commented here on IMDb, I couldn't wait for this self-indulgent junk to end, so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode that I really appreciated was when Jerry almost "bought the farm", hanging precariously at the end of a broken candle, hundreds of meters above a busy street.
