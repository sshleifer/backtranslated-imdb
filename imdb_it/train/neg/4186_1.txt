My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings found in the film. In fact, they are quite congruent with mine. What gives me is the fact that in terms of films, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of history, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that replacing song lyrics that fail to inspire someone outside of a declining audience is not the same as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or by the director. A stupid narrative remains so despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is one in which the devil makes his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way on the dance floor to put the words of Young song to the heroine into his mouth, ignore what has taken place Somehow these two dream of a scheme in which they will go to the west coast in search of ????? Sorry Neal, go on with the music and let Steven Stills make movies.
