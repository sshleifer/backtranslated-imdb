This was a stupid movie with a predictable plot and terrible acting !! Willy Nelson was as rigid as his braids. The film looked like a very long advertisement for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson was wearing, especially since there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not funny and, as I said, incredibly predictable. Whatever the money spent on making this film was a shameful waste. Any allusion to other old Marilyn Monroe movies did not improve Blonde Ambition's vision at all. It was also so incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to enter a position of executive secretary in the blink of an eye - which was ridiculous !!!
