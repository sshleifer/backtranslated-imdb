I saw the movie tonight in a free preview showing, and despite the fact that I didn't pay a penny to watch this movie, I still felt ripped off. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money and if you see this movie you are leaving a Benjamin in your place. The acting is torpid at best; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst imitation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas seems to realize he made the wrong choice by leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the time it took to shoot this turkey. Eva Longoria is a non-entity; he seems to be reading his lines from a teleprompter. And if you can't find the "mole" within the first 20 minutes, you have just landed on this planet from a world without TVs and recycled textures. If you really want to see a good secret service thriller, rent In the Line of Fire. If you see and buy into this, you will begin to fear for the safety of the president because the Secret Service looks and acts like adult versions of the kind since 90210. No matter what your feelings for W are, we hope that this "art" does not imitates life.
