I guess the bad Laurel and Hardy are better than Laurel and Hardy, but barely. It's sad that Fox movies are the ones that get a great DVD release, exposing people who may not be too familiar with L & H for their worst things rather than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again the boys are saddled with a silent and romantic plot about a boy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the owners' daughter, who hates him and prefers a slick type. It's amazing to think that Fox's geniuses thought that THIS is what L & H needed in their films. <br /> <br /> Without their pancake make-up, the boys look old and tired. The only scenes that work for them in this photo are when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene in which Robert Mitchum, being a classic bad noir, tries to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance" on Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump a Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
