Greenaway seems to have the habit of deliberately trying to disgust his viewers. This film opens with incest - and without purpose, meaningless, incest incidental to this. This is Greenaway's big problem. He prefers parlor tricks to really shock him by doing something meaningful. Technical skill is not enough. It's just a little perverse for perversity.
