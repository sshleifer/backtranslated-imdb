A confusing mess from start to finish. As the Beatles used to say, there was a secret message if the LP was played backwards. If one had the patience to watch the scenes of this film from the beginning, he would have come up with the same degree of disappointment. <br /> <br /> In addition to all this psychedelic mixture of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the film's supporters, ready to take revenge if the film wasn't sorted. There was nothing that these two could like either. Overacting, shouting and threats have been delivered in comic fashion. I think a dimension was an exaggeration. Ok, so maybe the artistic types are rolling their eyes enjoying the fact that unlike them, we plebeians didn't succeed. Well, I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movies transported from beginning to end. A non-existent and pathetic plot if you want to call it that, and by far the worst thing, not a single character you care about at all.
