My God! Please, for the sake of all that is holy, don't watch this movie! The 82 minutes of my life I will never return. Of course, I could have stopped looking halfway. But I thought it could be better. He did not. Anyone who has really appreciated this film is a seriously ill and twisted individual. No wonder that we Australians / New Zealanders have a bad reputation when it comes to making films. Everything about this film is horrible, from acting to editing. I don't usually write reviews here, but in this case I'll make an exception. I just wish someone had warned me before taking on this catastrophe
