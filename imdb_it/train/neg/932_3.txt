I saw this movie and was hoping for something better all the time. What's exceptional about a boy without emotions? * yawn * <br /> <br /> You never see Alex showing emotions for anyone other than his son. Yes, I know this is the reason why his son is the only one to make him lose patience (if you can call him that), I understand. <br /> <br /> The characters are not developed, relationships are not given enough time to be understood In one scene Sarah says they will not fall in love, and the next time we see her she is talking about how her death l Did he really shake because they were so close? The synapses of logic abound in this film. <br /> <br /> It is as if someone had looked at Boogie Nights and had written this part to imitate Little Bill. Even the scene where he "loses his cool" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, up to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - has he been there, done - can you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film not only lacked emotion, it was devoid of substance, a good script, developed characters and plot. And certainly my recommendation is missing. :) <br /> <br /> ~ A ~
