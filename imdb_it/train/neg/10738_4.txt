This was a DVD used for blind purchase. He completely killed a nice buzz I had when I hit the game. <br /> <br /> It's a bubble comedy, but it's um. shabby. The plot is ZANY !, but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently invented that I finally found it depressing to watch. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the box leads me to expect something more than an irregular and fool caper movie. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box and the Oscar nomination mean nothing).
