I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. You can't beat the two originals for a variety of reasons, including the directorial talent of Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This film had a terrible direction covered by an even more terrible acting. I can't even believe that these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Painful to watch and to watch. The plot was a complete joke on a secret chip and Russian terrorists in a meticulous search to go back. Horrible, rent one of the original trailers and have fun! <br /> <br /> The film was not even set during the Christmas season like the original. Home Alone has gone from an excellent family Christmas comedy to a joke without morals or plot!
