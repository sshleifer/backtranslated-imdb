OK, let's get to the point. We have five recent graduates (who must have graduated from the word F) who go on a weekend camping trip. They run into someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help, they decide instead to set him on fire. Nice group of people. Then some of them start to get sick - they have to be something in the cabin water where they are. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well, when things start to get worse, they block one of their mates instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some places don't like them much. They chase him in a high-speed game through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the booth (how could he find it and how could he travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another type of brain surgeon in the cabin understands that something is wrong and therefore hides in a cave to blow this blow. He decides the next day to return to the cabin believing that it must be a type of sanctuary. He is stunned by the relief of surviving (he must have thought it was a 24-hour bug). Too bad he is met by some not so friendly cops. Another couple decides to have sex while the meat eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realize that they need to shave their legs (taking a lot of the sick skin with shaving cream). However you understand the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I don't want to be friends with. I was rooting for the meat that the bacteria ate. Other characters were introduced that were also a bit funny but also absolutely unlikely. Ninety minutes of good life wasted here.
