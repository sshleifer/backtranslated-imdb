This is not a bad movie ... but it's the kind your girl makes you look at. History is not bad .... it only makes it seem like an hour and a half so long. It's hard for me to trash this movie because I really like the idea, but it was just a long and thin story ... too bad. The main character never really seems to change so much from start to finish. I mean, it goes through something that changes lives and can barely break a smile. I really thought the Mac was really good. His bizarre strangeness prevented the film from being a complete disaster. Maybe I just don't "get" this movie. If someone can explain it to me, I'd like to be informed.
