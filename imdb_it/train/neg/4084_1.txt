Every now and then you hear radio DJs inviting listeners to name films that the listener can't stand or has never looked at all the way. This is the movie I think of ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a Shakespeare play. I'm not sure, but I think I saved this movie for about 20 minutes ... I think I realized that my toenails didn't cut, and they looked at me imploringly to have them cut. <br /> <br /> This film seemed boring and pretentious to me. <br /> <br /> Although this is the first film I gave such a low score (which I actually tried to watch), I wouldn't want to get you out of other films by its English director, Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "The cook, the thief, his wife and his lover" was indeed a great British film, even if its contents sometimes stirred the stomach: a brilliant film, but I understand why people do refuses to see it. <br /> <br /> Another great Greenaway film was "A zed and two trough". Once again, he had some content that pushed the limits of good taste, but it was still intriguing. <br /> <br /> The other film that I usually think too late for these radio topics is "Brazil". He never managed to see it all the way - he kept falling asleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for important films that are extremely stylized, laboriously tiring and difficult to follow, then drive clear of Prosero's books.
