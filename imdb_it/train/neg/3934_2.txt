I couldn't wait to see this movie and see these great actors perform. However, I was sadly disappointed with the script and the whole plot of the plot. David Duchovny, (Dr Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", '04, was the doctor of history who uses drugs and loses the license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands was visiting a nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded client and was assisted by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Taking Lives", 04, who immediately became attracted to the Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", 04, plays the Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton seems to act excessively in most of the scenes and moves away completely from his mind trying to prevent his gang members from being killed. Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "TV Series CSI-Vegas", plays a very supportive role and plays a real SWEET COOL who is a so-called bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie is beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips that attract a lot of attention from all men. This film is not the best, but entertains.
