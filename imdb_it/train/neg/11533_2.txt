If the vengeful thrillers of rape and derivatives are predictable, then a rare thing comes to mind ... I don't like them very much, so I couldn't find anything to redeem this strange story. It looks like something that dates back to the 1980s, a different age in which it would go directly to the video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work well with a weak script and a boring scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing to get involved in a movie like this after the brilliance of her portrayal of Lady Deadlock in Bleak House's BBC television adaptation last year? The director is said to have been influenced by watching a quasi-rape and his work on documentaries, but even that is no excuse for the bizarre scene in which a pack of country dogs beat Dyer. I don't think I'm the only person in the cinema to laugh. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film: FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great British independent films in recent years. Verve has distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straight hair does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is it really the best you can do? What will the British independent directors do with your artistic judgment? It's a big stain on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear thousands of fans of British independent films crying in despair?
