This romantic comedy is not bad. There are fun things that happen here and there, and there are some pretty memorable characters. <br /> <br /> The acting, however, is amateur (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are very funny, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of poor history. <br /> <br /> All in all, I imagine it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the ending was pretty good. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
