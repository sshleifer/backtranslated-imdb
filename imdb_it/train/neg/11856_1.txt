I just watched this movie last night at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and I seriously wonder if the people at the festival actually project the films before selecting them. The film was simply horrible - I say this without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modine's days as protagonists are over. Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a strange little cameo - she should also be ashamed. The script was terrible and we were not given any reason to worry about the characters. I strongly doubt that this will be picked up, but then again, in Hollywood we know that sometimes mistakes are made. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious contender for the worst movie I've ever seen.
