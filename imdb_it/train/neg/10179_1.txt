This film is a disgrace to the Major League franchise. I live in Minnesota and even can't believe they dumped Cleveland. (Yes, I realized that the real Indians were pretty good, and that the twins had taken their place at the bottom of the American League, but they were still consistent). Anyway, I loved the first Major League, I liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally come to the series. You can't tell me that this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. What happened? However if you are a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and don't look at this garbage.
