Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this film as well. He should have come out with a bang, being the classy actress who was, not in this film not memorable, almost unknown. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is ok, but nothing special. The first half is much better because it becomes rather stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and go out. Even his high-pitched voice has become a bit annoying here. It is said that he was not happy with this film. You can understand why. <br /> <br /> History reminded me of a television sitcom from the 1950s. About this, I thought that David Nelson of Ozzie & Harriet's TV series was in this film, but he turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and looked like Nelson. <br /> <br /> In general, so-so at best and a comparable ending for a great actress.
