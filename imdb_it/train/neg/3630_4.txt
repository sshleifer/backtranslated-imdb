Should we assume that those who have praised this film ("the greatest cinematographic work of all time", I have not read somewhere?) Or do not care about the work, do not care about Wagner, or do not care about anything except their desire to appear cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan song, or as a film, this strikes me as an absolute disaster, with a lead reading of the score combined with a grim and grim realization of the text. <br /> <br /> it is debatable that people with ideas about what a work (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare) or "su" should be allowed anywhere near a theater or a film studio; Syberberg, very fashionable, but without the slightest justification of Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is "about bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the last stages, turns into a kind of beatnik child, although one who continues to sing tenor - few if none of the actors in the film are the singers, and we receive a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but does not feel like the voice) of Amfortas, and appears also monstrously in double exposure as a sort of Batonzilla or director who ate Monsalvat during the game of Good Friday music - in which, by the way, the enchanted beauty of nature is represented by a handful of crunchy flabby and disheveled stuck in badly placed turf, a gimmick that baffles me.In the theater we sometimes have to highlight these imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't think why Syberberg could not unite and, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, a lush mountain pasture as expected for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music. . <br /> <br /> The sound is hard to bear, the high voices and trumpets in particular possess an acoustic glow that adds another kind of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic conduct of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the recording of Bayreuth in 1951, and Knappertsbusch, although his times are often very slow, had what Jordan is lacking, the sense of pulse, the sensation of the ebb and flow of music - and, after half a century, the orchestral sound of that set, in modern prints, is still superior to this film.
