S.I.C.K. really stands for So incredibly lousy I killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to talk about. The best part of the entire production was the artwork on the cover of the box. The budget of this film was sufficient. Filming was under sesame street. The production seems to be that of underground filming for hit mobs. The props used in this film were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you should go fast in the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at all costs. I liked the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worth it. Just kidding.
