After seeing the first 20mn of Blanche (I'm sorry I couldn't take more), I have now confirmed that this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Basically, this "film" is an insult to the real French actors participating in this farcical piece of garbage. It starts from a concept successfully used in French comedies ("Deux heures moins the quart avant Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandeurs", ...): a historical film with anachronistic tones / dialogues. This can give brilliant results if supported by brilliant actors and a "finesse" of direction that avoids the feared stigma of "heavy comedy". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the horseshoe-shaped Lou Doillon ruins everything and Blanche, instead of a comedy, turns into a horror movie. Horror to film buffs who want to be baffled and shocked by watching good actors like Decaune, Zem or Rochefort who struggle in the middle of this sumptuous burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
