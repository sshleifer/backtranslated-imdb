HERA PHERI by Priyadarshan was a beautiful situational comedy. This film does not really have a story but is rather funny but illogical <br /> <br /> Actually it is not a true story and yet somehow manages to manage a pleasant flow also if it's nothing special <br /> <br /> The first half has 2 fun scenes like the one in which Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters <br /> <br /> the first time it gets boring slowly but the second half is more fun even if it's not a script <br /> <br /> The jokes are fun even if you wonder why they don't hear the voices of every person inside the rooms? <br /> <br /> The climax confusion is treated as a theatrical game but it is quite funny But the film ends abruptly <br /> <br /> The direction is ok Music is good <br /> <br / > Akshay Kumar excels in her part that has now become her second skin, but this is her film completely and overshadows all others <br /> <br /> John stumbles into everything and fails in the play Paresh Rawal is hilarious Rajpal is ok Nargis, Daisy and Neetu (only Neetu is now seen) are good in some parts but sometimes they scream too much Manoj Joshi is fine
