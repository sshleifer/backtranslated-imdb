This film was terrible. The plot sucked, the acting was very bad, the editing was inept and this film makes me want to get my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie. The ballooning scene was stupid, Mormon's lines are really old, the soundtrack was sucked, I didn't see any chemistry between the two protagonists, it's full of stereotypes, stupid locals "celeb" cameo's ... the best known been Del "I'm going to drive as fast as I want .." computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors have had to play themselves spiritually and they too have ruined everything. This film helps create a long series of weak efforts to integrate the LDS convictions in Hollywood. OSSIA RM, the Church dance, etc. Etc. I would like to give up watching this movie and instead run to a brick wall first. You will be more amused than watching this poor excuse for a show.
