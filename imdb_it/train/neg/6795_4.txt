The Comeback begins to look promising, with a brutal death scene wearing a killer mask. The mask is also quite beautiful and looks almost identical to the one used in the slash movie of the 90s "Granny". From that moment on, the film is mostly boring. We have other deaths, which are good again, but there are not enough. The reason the deaths are so good is because they are hectic and bloody. The story behind the movie is actually quite interesting and would have worked very well if it wasn't so boring for the most part. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this unless you are an irreducible collector - there is not enough to make it even a classic slasher movie.
