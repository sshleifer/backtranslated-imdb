From the beginning, the political theme of this film is so obvious and heavy, that the result is completely predictable. Any good textbook on screenplays will suggest the layering of the characters, incorporating strings of characters and three structures of action. You won't find any of this in this film. The policemen are the villains, and consequently they are shown superficial, incompetent and cowardly. It seems that the creators of this film never seem that the police could be honorable citizens who see police membership as a good way to contribute to the welfare of society. <br /> <br /> The spectator does not have the opportunity to put his mind on whether Ned Kelly is a good boy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we have no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him passing through the door of a prison, but only to know that he has been inside for three years when we hear him much later in some dialogue. <br /> <br /> This film contains many shots of Ned looking at the camera with a serious expression. I found the film a real task to watch. It is the direction of modern films, and this has discouraged me from looking more.
