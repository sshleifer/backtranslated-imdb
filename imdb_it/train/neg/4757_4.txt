I've seen Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier for a while. Michael Caine is back, but now he is her husband and Jude Law his wife's lover. The story is always the same and it's a fantastic comedy. <br /> <br /> During the film I always had the impression of watching a performance. This is one of the reasons why I don't like the remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted to a play, I still have to hear that I see a movie and not just a game. Director Kenneth Brannigan has made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the appearance of the film. The design was modern, elegant, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never had the feeling that anyone ever lived in that house. The photograph was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark light, green light, to round off not eye-friendly. <br /> <br /> The acting was really good. The performances of Michael Caine and Jude Law are at their best. I'd really like to see these 2 guys playing together on stage. But I have to confess I was never a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the central part. I remember that in the original this part was still very mysterious and wonderfully directed. I tried to watch it twice and always in the central part I felt asleep. The final part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not terrible, but it seems to be more a film for critics than for the public. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more fun than Sleuth (2007).
