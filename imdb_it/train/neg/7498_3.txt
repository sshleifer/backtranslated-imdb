Spike Lee has been in decline since his first successes and this mess does nothing to help. I often looked at my watch hoping that the movie would end or get to the point. Lee's first film with an all-white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and love funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame character of the godfather does nothing but increase the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I admired many of Lee's films, especially "Do the Right Thing". This film is a waste of time.
