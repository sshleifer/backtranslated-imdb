Friend, what a scam it turned out to be! Not because it wasn't good (since I didn't expect anything from that) but because I was misled by the DVD cover that blatantly ignored its "stars" like Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill. Sure enough, their names don't appear in the film's opening credits, much less themselves in the rest !! As it turned out, the only film that connects these three actors together is the equally obscure LAS VEGAS LADY (1975) ?? but what has anyone to do with THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER? Although, given that I paid $ 1.50 for his rental and I was still in a monster mood, I chose to watch the film regardless and, yes, it smelled! Apart from the fact that he had an unnamed cast and an anonymous crew, an unmistakably amateur air was visible from miles away and the best I could do was laugh at the similar claims to JAWS and, intentionally, to resist antics of two diehard owners of drug dealers who often quarrel with each other with the astonished local sheriff watching. The creature itself ?? a plesiosaur that is half-dinosaur / half fish ?? it is imperfectly realized (of course) but, as in the case of THE GIANT CLAW (1957) that I have just seen, this does not seem to bother filmmakers anybody who flaunts it as much as possible, especially during the second half of the movie!
