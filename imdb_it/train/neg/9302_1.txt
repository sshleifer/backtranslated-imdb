This film is simply horrible. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen and the scenery is so bad that it's fun. <br /> <br /> The "main" actor should be the sexy guy who gets all the girls, but he is ugly, overweight and it seems to be from the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All characters are out for the weekend for a meeting with friends, but nobody is really a friend! The married couple did not see the "main" boy in over 5 years and even then they were not really friends. The "date" of the main boy knows him only from work and from a girl taking in a bar. Now tell me you'd risk losing your job to spend a weekend in the cabin with people who aren't even your real friends. Because that's what it does at the beginning of the movie! <br /> <br /> Don't waste even a minute of your time on this lemon. I made home movies scarier than this! <br /> <br />
