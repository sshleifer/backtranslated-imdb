Birthday Girl doesn't know what she wants to be - it's a comedy, it's a drama ... she just doesn't know. What could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no-man's land. The premise is original enough to justify a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly provides it and ends up running out. This is a real shame when you look at the cast: it's very solid, but it doesn't have the chance to shine. Very disappointing.
