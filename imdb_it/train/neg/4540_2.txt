At the beginning, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - this shows the difficulties of a real interpretation of esoteric issues. I loved the book and was completely disappointed with the film. It was ridiculous, with half a heart and the story unfairly explained. The novel - first! - he was not destined to concentrate on an adventure! This is just the environment. In the film, the attention is reversed on this and the message has passed into the background! Moreover, the visual effects to show the energy of all living beings and the elucidation of events were ultimately thrifty! They screwed him! ... I will never look at it again!
