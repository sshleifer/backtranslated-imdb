this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I was paid. The so-called horror scenes in it were immeasurably predictable and finished. There was really nothing in this movie that would have made it original or was worth $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read it online because any of these things would be a total loss of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for insulting her good name with this movie. Shame on you, Sarah, for being associated with this horrible and horrible film. Horrible movie, no need to ever see it.
