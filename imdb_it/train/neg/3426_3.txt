Being a fan of the manga and anime of Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.), I couldn't wait to do it. I had not seen either the manga or the anime, so I had no preconceived ideas that entered. Good to me too. What we have here is a series of silly softcore films of the type that presented themselves with late regularity on cable channels late at night. While it is domesticated compared to the one that is thrown in the throat of normal cable viewers (our hero's bits are tastefully hidden behind a strategically glued scarf or decorated with a ridiculous sunburst effect), there are prolonged scenes of slavery and torture that you lend on the record enough good humor to make it unsuitable for children. Although I have absolutely nothing against naked female heroes, I don't like amateur movies (there are at least four in this series). On the plus side, there is at least one extraordinarily beautiful actress in each of the four episodes I've seen. No wonder Nagai's TESTICLE BOY has never done it ...
