This is certainly one of the worst films ever made. Every scene is painful. You will complain about the fragile attempts at humor, the clumsy photographic work, the sexism and racism, the ridiculous narrative line, the wooden acting. Poor Joan Bennett; she is the only one in the film who is not an embarrassment. In all, terrible.
