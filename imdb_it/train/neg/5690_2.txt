First of all ... I never considered myself a Uwe Boll Hater because I think I never saw one of his films but after seeing this cheap excuse for a movie called "Seed" (which is the name of the serial killer , this movie is about) I'm close to joining the hate club. This film makes absolutely no sense ... the plot is a joke and although Boll clearly tries to attract attention by shocking people, 90% of this film is simply bored. You can summarize this film like this: <br /> <br /> 1. The hooded killer watches the animal sequences being tortured on TV. This is a film taken from fur farms and the film opens with the ridiculous motive of "making a declaration about humanity" and giving a Peta address. Since this movie has no message and is the worst piece of torture, the exploitation of porn already has a reason to hate the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> 2. Death by electrocution with a pretext that gives away what happens later in this film printed on the screen, so that every retard understands it. <br /> <br /> 3. The policemen watch videos of animals, children and women who died of hunger and decomposed in Seeds' basement, who have stupid nightmares and cry in their whiskey because the seed is a wicked evil mofo. Even if acting is OK, the film takes a dive whenever it tries to incorporate any emotion ... <br /> <br /> 4. The cops break the seed in his house, behave in a stupid way and are made to pieces in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you can barely see anything except torches. Seed is a super killer who is everywhere at once and all the cops behave stupidly enough to be killed ... except for one who engages him. <br /> <br /> 5. Seed takes the chair and sees his electrocution as long as in this "movie" ... he will not die and we are reminded of the opening statement that must be released if he survives 3 electric shocks . Guess that ... they bury him alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed leaves the grave, kills everyone in another part of the cut and then looks for the main policeman to take revenge. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman gets her head with a hammer in an endless sequence from a point of view only for the funny and shocking value of it. <br /> <br /> 8. Seed captures the cop family, lures him to his home, threatens to kill his wife and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail gun, the policeman shoots himself in the head considering what the seed wants (it is difficult to get into the head of that boy since he not only wears the mask even in prison but never utters a word ... the film has virtually no dialogue, so it doesn't matter). <br /> <br /> 9. Boll goes for a shocking nihilistic end where Seed blocks his daughter with his dead father to rot like the people we saw on video on sequence 3. <br /> <br /> This is ... no message, no storyline, no reason, no face behind the mask, no background except a stupid story that Seed was burned as a child. <br /> <br /> This film is based exclusively on a few key scenes and their shock value. I barely remember a movie so empty of any emotion, message or entertainment. It's like watching August Underground ... that's fine for me, some people will appreciate this mindless snuff. But what is really hard to say about it is the pseudo-message at the beginning and the fact that the film is well done considering the camera, the effects and even the acting is too good for this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> So, how does Boll get the money to make these "movies" when thousands of talented directors work on limited budgets ?? "Seed" is not only the essence of ridicule, its living proof that the free market is imperfect ... lucky Uwe that the German tax payer is paying a lot of this waste to get deductions.
