In light of the recent and quite good Batman the brave and the bold, now is the time to give a fatal blow to that mistake in the life of Batman. Being a big fan since Tim Burton's first awakening 20 years ago, I was able to accept different tones in the character, dark or campy. This is not credible: too many effects, poor intrigues and so few questions. The great thing about Batman is the diversity of his abilities and aspects of his personality: detective, crime fighter, playboy, philanthropist, etc. Batman shows it only in his karate days. And by the way, how come the Penguin is capable of such virtuosity when it blows up regardless of its corpulent corpulence? And look at the Joker, a mixture of Blanka in Street Fighter 2 and a stereotypical reggae, which Batman fan could accept such betrayal? Not me anyway. Batman is much better without the "The" article in front of his name.
