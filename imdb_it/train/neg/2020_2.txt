They look like two films: a sad and pretentious story of an actor who is occupied by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social commentary on a middle-aged divorce that is picked up by a maid. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another company on the side. He drops heavy hints about the need for connections, his certificate in massage and his desire to enter the modeling game. I love his squalid apartment with a kitchenette behind a curtain and her terrible seductive dress with a crochet top with balloon sleeves. <br /> <br /> Do actors get Oscars for Shakespeare? We know the Oscars to impersonate the disabled, wear many prostheses or pretend to be crazy. The Shakespearean scenes (which go back and forth) are embarrassing and dated. And so are the 'crazy' scenes in which Tony seems distracted while listening to his voiceover. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. It makes it quite clear in one of the first scenes that it was a choir. When he mentions his father's advice, he slips into a cockney accent.
