The first half of this version was the best I've ever seen (and I think I saw every version of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of childhood and Jane's character was exceptional. Then, it was like someone said "Uh oh, it's too long" and tore the rest of the story to pieces. The main scenes, when included, are ignored, combined and put out of order so as to completely change the plot. There has been so little transition or even the development of the scene that it would have been difficult for anyone not familiar with the story to even follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened up so much hope, and then the end went up in smoke.
