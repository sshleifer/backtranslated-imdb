Manmohan Desai has made some funny but illogical films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS <br /> <br /> This film is one of the worst movies he ever made . Mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so ugly that you make yourself shudder <br /> <br /> The British are made with eyebrows and the film seems so strange The scene in the British hotel is damn stupid <br /> < br /> the film has many nonsense like Amrita that assaults Amitabh and then the whole scene more towards the climax of the film gets even worse There are more gems like the statue of the horse that comes to life, The masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more <br /> <br /> Manmohan's direction Desai hurts Music goes well <br /> <br /> Amitabh does its part with style, nothing different from COOLIE, LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is ok Satyen Kapuu it's ok Prem Chopra is like usual, Nirupa Roy is his usual again too Dara Singh is as usual
