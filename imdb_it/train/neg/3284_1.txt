Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only "Manos: The Hands of Fate" has dragged more than "Dukes". I had more fun taking a look at the gigantic plot holes that the film gave me at any time. Let's touch on some ... <br /> <br /> There was a remarkable death and rebirth script when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't answer. He shrugs and goes on, since neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he is talking about (nor us). It was as if the engine had died and had started again. <br /> <br /> The few times General Lee was flying in the air weren't even that exciting. Nothing that I haven't seen on the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo was angry with Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually obscured it (albeit roughly). The rest of the time seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> The horrible, horrendous accent (or lack thereof) of Seann William Scott. <br /> <br /> I hated the performance of Willie Nelson. Were bad jokes to be catchy? I wanted it to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson comes across beautifully on the big screen. It actually felt like one of the best actors in the film. He's telling you how awful this movie is. She is a goddess. <br /> <br /> During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the villains to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have been enough. <br /> <br /> This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration in the abysmal writing and in the execution of what could have been a truly moving film. <br /> <br /> If only we could cancel and start again ...
