Quite typical for Swedish films of this type. Strange that the acting was really bad, these actors usually give a good show. The casting was bad, made you wait for something (I won't tell you what). The protagonist was terrible ... I don't know where they find it. Anyway, stay away from this and go see "Den Tredje VÃ¥gen" instead, this is the Swedish action in the foreground.
