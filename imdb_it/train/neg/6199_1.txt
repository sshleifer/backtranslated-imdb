First a technical review. The script is so slow, it's really a 25-minute story exploded up to 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. The "acting" is pathetic, it seems that they have really raised the pupils out of the classroom to read a few lines from an idiot. As for the whole "point" of the story, namely "the war is bad" (oh, there is a shock!) It is really non-existent. Without the "let shake" scene and get big publicity "scene no one would talk about this movie. It's so bad that it actually bothers me to think about what are the best things that the money used could have gone on. Believe me, I saw some bad "Emperor's new clothes", but the only thing I can say for them is that they were well turned and well made while the camera swung during two scenes in this one! Read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and do not mention it.
