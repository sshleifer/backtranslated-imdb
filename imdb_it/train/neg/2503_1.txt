What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I am ashamed to call myself New Zealand when this film exists and currently plays on satellite TV in New Zealand (August 2006). The cast consists of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company logo (a dolphin) still in the whole set, including the ship's funnel. The ship should be a cruise ship / ferry between the United States and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age everywhere, but it should be a luxury ship on its maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow-capped peaks of the South Island of New Zealand in the background for God's sake! It must have been a very cold time in the US / Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the New Zealand / American accents just don't work. I expect the New Zealand taxpayer to have contributed to the production cost of this film and that it was a waste of money better spent on real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their mobile phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they blocked a Taco Company sign on the truck door, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is above the top of the tagging: you would think they would notice it in the props department before connecting it. I'd like to go on, but it's not worth it in any way.
