When I saw this movie, I couldn't believe my eyes. Where did these hilarious creatures, muppets dustbin with large pointed teeth, really want to be scary? Or where they planned to have a good laugh (I sincerely hope so). If you look closely, you can even see the strings that manage them (better to drag them onto the screen). The whole thing was rather funny and scary and I enjoyed watching the movie because I was surprised by its general inability to have only a good part. It's a big joke from beginning to end and I think this movie belongs to a new category: so incredibly lousy you'll laugh from beginning to end. (I'm not going to comment on the acting or any other stuff)
