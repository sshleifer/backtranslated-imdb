This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she didn't live in any commune with him (he was angry that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right here and there I had problems with the series - come on, I tell myself, is the same nobleman Michael Stivic who contrasted the right winged philosophies of Archie Bunker? The series went on, but didn't have any pizazz. The amount of motion Sally Struthers had gained from All the Family was long gone. Perhaps if the series had another name and was presented as totally independent of All In The Family, it could have worked. Ah well, this is the entertainment world.
