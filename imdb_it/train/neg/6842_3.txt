"Paula, I could be a bitch, but I'll never be a mess!" <br /> <br /> A hilarious line in an otherwise rather annoying leather movie that features a nice treasure in Stacey Walker, but that's it. This girl is a real provocateur who attracts her boyfriends, co-workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula in her bedroom, but then turns into a witch work that mourns the "rape" and calls the police ! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic personality of this c ** t certified is perhaps interesting for a while, but this story eventually turns into a real repetitive one-note affair. At least the final deserves the wait, for those who will take care of it at that time.
