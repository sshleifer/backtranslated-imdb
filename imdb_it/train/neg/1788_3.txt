Giving credit where it is due, only the technicolor, the costumes and the ensembles deserve an honorable mention. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point of BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The script is approximate as you might imagine and neither the casual Bing nor William Bendix nor Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to fix it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely silly in a page boy's wig. And the poor Rhonda Fleming has a starring role in a heroine costume that forces her to look adorable Bing and little else apart from warbling a couple of uninspired ballads with a voice probably nicknamed for the occasion. <br /> <br /> Simply awful! Mark Twain's intelligence is not evident in any of the scripts. Only die-hard Crosby fans can appreciate this mess of a movie with an uninspired direction. Even the extras seem like they don't know what they should do. <br /> <br /> In summary: boring as dirty water. Not recommended, even for children.
