Before writing this review, I went back to reread the reviews of others. This film was a particular disappointment to me, since it features two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, who boasts an often stunning soundtrack by Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair ""). The dance was drawn, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgotten, the story a joke. Even the costumes were not particularly flattering. Only photography has correctly captured the right mood and spirit. that the others liked "The girls of Rochefort", although I certainly didn't.
