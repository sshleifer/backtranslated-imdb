I was thrilled to see Catalu√±a's film in the Berlin competition. But after the presentation I was disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many themes for nothing. The Spanish civil war, like any war, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not at all nice, is shown in uncountable films and games, as well as relationships between homosexuals and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr. Villaronga feels is a pseudo tragedy that can belong to the worst of the film's history. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this film. I advise nobody in any case to go and see this movie.
