Well, because I'm a musician I thought, maybe I'll check this movie on TMC, nothing else good. One of the worst mistakes of my life so far, and it's only half of the work. I seriously thought it was one of those soft core movies with a lousy plot and disgusting acting, shitty movies and shitty effects. But no, I don't even like it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for some laughter, but I wasn't sure if they were trying to throw or not. But now I have to sit here and watch the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I sit here typing up to 10 lines
