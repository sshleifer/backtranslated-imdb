I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this ruined train of a movie and convinced poor Stevie Wonder to eternally pair her beautiful music with this theatrical mess. It also irritates me the way he uses swear words as part of the normal prose of black professionals. The abuse of his hold on ethnic film-goers is a pity. The scenes that seem to come up with blue and have nothing to do with the theme or subtitles, sound like a college kid writing this. In particular, I hate the ridiculous scene in which the two protagonists are jokingly sparring for no reason and the cops arrive and make the Snipes tour. Lead exaggeration gives the impression that Spike has no respect for his viewers or has no idea what a movie is. The final scene seems to have been thrown to justify the use of a sledge hammer to face a point. This film also supports the myth that all people of culture use the word F in a casual conversation. I hope he realizes that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this one where he doesn't grow as a director. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. It should be limited to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls. Shocking movies don't do an Oscar.
