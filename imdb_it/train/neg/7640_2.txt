Basically I found that the Eden's Curve was a very bad building that made it difficult to see. However, there is something I have to say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 1970s in the choice of settings and clothing. The "return to earth" philosophy and interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as has been described in many later versions of the 1970s, was correct, as was the pseudo- "Don't ask don't say "the liberalism of the fraternity made up of intellectuals of the east coast, except that I would have thought that a New England school was more likely than one in Virginia, where I imagine that the" good boy "mentality continued to dominate also elite schools like this one. Another thing that I appreciated that could be related is that this was a time when homosexuality was not so much tied to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not linked to these terribly abused images. It seemed very unfortunate to me that "gay culture" took some standard forms in the 1980s from Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out a huge number of homosexuals who were more submissive in their lifestyle. I enjoyed the film mainly as a way to remember a more natural way of talking about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene".
