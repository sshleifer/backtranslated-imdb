Cynthia Rothrock, (China O'Brien), "Manhattan Chase", from 2000, made this film pleasant to watch and, of course, and this nice girl burned the screen with her artistic skills and her sexy and sexy body. China O'Brien gets angry as a police officer and decides to retire and return home to his hometown and return to his roots and his father, who is the local sheriff. His father is getting old and the city has changed, the gangsters have conquered the city and have begun to convince the local women to start playing tricks and the people of the city were getting sick and tired of their city by going to Hell. Well, you can almost guess what happens, and you're right, China O'Brien fights again after a great tragedy has hit his life. Bad acting throughout the film, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this film to a wonderful conclusion.
