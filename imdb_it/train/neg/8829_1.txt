This is an abysmal story piece. It's about an hour in the film, before having a great idea of ​​what should be treated; the characters often mutter inaudibly; actions often seem to have no relation to one another; no one seems to care about who actually killed the girl; a pair of ghostly children go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens; the Irishman is punched in the face by one of his friends for no apparent reason ... to continue would be as boring as the film itself. The only amusing medium is landscape photography; but anyone could point a camera in the Australian outback to get memorable shots. Overall - depressing, inconsistent, pretentious - and decidedly annoying for having wasted so much of the viewer's time.
