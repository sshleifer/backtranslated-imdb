Maybe something escapes me because I read more positive things about the man who deceived me than I read negative reviews - and I just don't understand. I like my noir to have a little style with characters that talk, look and behave like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura. None of the characters in this film have that style or presence or anything else you want to call it. Take the main actor, Lee J. Cobb. His disheveled and lying appearance on the bed is further from the dashed and silent noir archetype that you will find. Or, take Jane Wyatt as a femme fatale as another example. This is one of the worst cases of disconnection I've seen in a while. It is not convincing in the role. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, she is tired and has no surprises or news for the genre. I could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated after about five minutes. And that final scene of cat and mouse hunting is simply boring. Ten to fifteen minutes of events that didn't happen anything really ruined every rhythm that the film could have had.
