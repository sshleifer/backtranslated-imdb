As a young black / latin woman I am always looking for films that represent the experiences and lives of people like me. Of course when I saw this movie in the video store I thought I would like it; unfortunately, I didn't. Although the topics presented in the film are interesting and relevant, the story was not properly developed properly. The film continues to drag on and many of the characters that appear on the screen come and go without much to contribute to the film. If the director had done a better job connecting the scenes, maybe I would have liked a little more. Honestly, I would recommend a movie like "Raising Victor" on this one every day. I wasn't too impressed.
