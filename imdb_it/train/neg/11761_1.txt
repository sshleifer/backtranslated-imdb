Complete Drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical and toxic culture of a decade ago. In this film, the pedestrian's regrets of slavery go hand in hand with colonial subtexts (the annoying red that feeds Shaka rice?). Forget historical reality too. Did most Western slaves not come from West Africa? An American slaver easily captures Shaka with a handful of men? In the end, David Hasslehoff could not have been more hateful. One can only reflect, how would he go in the miniseries? (Most likely impalable). The miniseries was superb, and it's a shame that DH had to get his hands on something unique, making it trivial. (I tend to think it helped create this fiasco).
