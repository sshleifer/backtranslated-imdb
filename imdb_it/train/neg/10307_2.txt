The "mathematical" aspect of this is just a gimmick to try to set up this television program in addition to the millions of other cop shows. The only saving aspect of this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed for this schlock. <br /> <br /> The lame "mathematics" aspect to the show is encapsulated in an episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which only confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned). To catch a fugitive, the "mathematician" uses a "bubble" theory. Thus, it gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspicion in places A, B and C, then we can use the "bubble theory" to calculate where it could be. Do all this on a blackboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I don't remember). <br /> <br /> However, when you look at the finished product, it basically took three points and chose a point right in the middle and said "Ok, mathematically, this is where the fugitive is most likely to be found". At that point, another character points out "Oh, that point is also the cabin where the boy lived." Is it math? It's not even connecting-the-f ** k ** g-dot !!! This show reminds me of the major mathematician I worked with in the banking sector who had a mathematical analysis that could do to "support" points that everyone had already agreed with a less complex analysis or with basic common sense. > <br /> Just show off - When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I look forward to attacking the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA ... They will use the calculation, call an air strike in the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields ... because hey ... it's all about numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV show.
