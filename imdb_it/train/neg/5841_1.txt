Spoilers below, but keep reading or you'll never know the horrible fate that awaits all planings to rent "Rodentz". <br /> <br /> On a full moon night, in a remote research lab, an important medical breakthrough is about having deadly results. A chemical compound that was created to "hunt and destroy" deadly cancer cells was leaked from the hazardous waste disposal system in the basement of the building. Now, the rodents involved in the laboratory experiment on the upper floor are not the only rats in the structure that will become the altered species. Professor Schultz, an important bio-researcher, has just established that the addition of a new enzyme now allows his formulation to "hunt and destroy" to regenerate for the time necessary to neutralize the deadly cancer tumors. When three different grades of the new mixture are administered to three different rats and the rest is poured into the faulty "Waste Hazard" sink, shocking side effects cause a night of terror ..... right ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Everything about it screams "Low-budget!", From the horrible acting to the special effects that are among the worst I've ever seen. The characters are idiotic clich√©s and act in stupid and predictable ways: walking alone in the dark corridors, looking for a cat, stumbling and falling so that the "mice" can reach them, climb a small room, etc. <Br /> <br /> While some films are made cheaply, this film really makes the difference. Every possible corner is cut, by reusing the previous shots, filming the "Lab" corridors from different angles to make it look bigger (this reminds me - why were there only two guys who worked in this bizarre building?!?!? !?), to the music and special effects that can be done on the PC of a laboratory for children. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung: special effects. Simply horrendous. Computer-generated rats seem so fake and stand out in every scene, so even the most stupid of movie fans could see that they are computer-generated. And that giant mouse dress - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! seriously, should we believe that fucking kid with beans is a monster? Simply pitiful ........ The best side, some of the gores seem pretty interesting, especially considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Actors suck. no one involved in the production worried or knew what they were doing. I've lost enough time with the review, follow my advice, it's junk. 1/10. <br /> <br /> Information on the DVD: The transfer sucks, the audio is passable and there is a commentary on the director's disc and two of his friends, who say that they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but they were there to ask questions and make comments. All three of these primordial sub-human slimes are so incredibly stupid that they have to be institutionalized before they can harm themselves or others. I don't want to waste any more time of your kind reader or mine, because I'm starting to remember more than what I want about this movie ..... Classification of the DVD: 1/10.
