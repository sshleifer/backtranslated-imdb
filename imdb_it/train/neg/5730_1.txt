Where to start also? The horrible acting? The senseless plot? The effects of the bargain basement? Absolutely disgusting characters? The choppy montage? The Casio keyboard score that induces headaches ??? The embarrassing racist remarks ("Look at it, Charlie!", "Back, Jackie Chan !!" ??? The constant misogyny ??? I'm a fan of horror all my life, and I have no problem with the current " torture "-thon" tendency of the films.However, this is a piece of garbage badly done.I think that I suffered more pain to look at this than the characters died in it! If you like girls forced to eat pan-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and lines of thought like "I'm gonna find b **** and staple her c *** shut !!" are smart, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> For how much I'm concerned, I feel the need to go and wash my eyes with oven cleaner to never see this movie again!
