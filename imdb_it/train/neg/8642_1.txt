I must say that this is a terrible film, for the simple fact that when you see this film on the guide, it is listed as a documentary. As I watched, did I start laughing, thinking to myself, that this guy expects me to believe it's true? So I had to look, and now I see it's a movie, but now since it's not a documentary, now it's a movie with bad acting. SO, in both cases, it's pretty ugly. I actually didn't make it to the end. I had to turn it off. I am a New York police officer and I heard that someone was trying to mislead people into thinking that it was a documentary, with the intention of making money from a terrible day for me and my colleagues. So, I took it a little personal. Maybe I was blinded by that, and it's not as bad as I personally think it is. Everyone has their own opinion.
