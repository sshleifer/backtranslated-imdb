A somewhat disappointing film, I would say: the acting was in some way drawn up. In many cases, I just couldn't think that the facial expressions corresponded to the words spoken or to the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe he is angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). This does not happen here. <br /> <br /> Writers' comment presuming that you already know the characters were suitable. They do things and say things that come from nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he explodes and freaks out, telling his father "Don't touch me, fuckin!" Perhaps, if we had seen the prequel, we would have understood where all this came from, but there is no prequel, so we are somehow at sea about reason! <br /> <br /> A strange, bizarre thing that Andrew does is go to an old stone quarry, sit on the edge facing the "still water" below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket, takes out a pack of cigarettes and lights one. He did the same thing three times during the film; I suppose we should see it as a tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It may have been four times, I lost count. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there is the fact that he recently discovered that he was adopted; this happens very early in the film, so there is no sense of any dramatic change that it could undergo due to this discovery. It is not very clear if this is why it is so bitter or if it is something else. I imagine there is a sort of Lynchian atmosphere for the film, but what if a first-time director really tried to scale it down a mountain so early in his career?
