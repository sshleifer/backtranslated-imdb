I bought this film and got a gloriously free, over the top, entertaining a bloodbath. I didn't have any of them. This film fails at virtually every level, it's not scary at all, or funny, it's just a terrible movie, and it never offers the public something worth watching. The worst thing is that, far from being raw, violent and brutal as was promised, there is very little violence. Virtually no blood and no excitement. Acting, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly won't want to watch it again. Don't waste time with a celluloid waste like this; it's really probably the worst movie ever made. If I could give it less stars, I'd do it.
