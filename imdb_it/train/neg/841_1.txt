I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just saw. Mainly I think it is a film on an S & M "star" of CD Rom internet that are as realistic as online flash comics. She was murdered by someone, which causes her sister and a crackling team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death. Even the local homicide division of Big City, USA, is investigating, although most of his work comes from how to take a ride on CD ROM which he claims is realistic "like the real thing". I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only one in the film who has some kind of credits behind him. He's been in the movie for about 15 minutes, and half of this is he beating the main girl for apparently no apparent reason. I won't even explain the end, because frankly I can't get out of it alone. But before the final scene, we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of the entire film. Honestly, they could have directed that final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross direction and all. <br /> <br /> All in all, stay away from this movie. I understood it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I really could have used that 80 minutes on something else and was more satisfied. For example, playing that game with a knife where you hit yourself repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more fun.
