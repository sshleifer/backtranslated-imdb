As others have already said, "No, Luciano" is a more suitable title or a response to this title of the film. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing ... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family film, so to speak - but after all it is nothing but a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Appropriately playing a singer, Pavarotti, like "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice a couple of times and the doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls in love with the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time and so on and so forth. <br /> <br /> Pavarotti has a captivating smile and is a nice guy. It is Harrold who ruins things and after looking at it here I am not surprised that it has not become a star. <br /> <br /> There are beautiful landscapes in the film to be enjoyed, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film. I got bored and I don't remember much of the second part of it.
