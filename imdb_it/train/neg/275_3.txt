It is absolutely incredible for me that someone can comment that this film is not a preacher. It is not only oppressively beloved, but absurd, pulled onto the stage, dramatically with straight sleeves and painfully overwhelmed. Looking at him, it feels like an 8 year old boy punished by having to write "I will not become a fascist" on the board 100 times. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that it was done during the height of World War II, and it had to be a courageous condemnation of Hitler and the terrible sufferings he caused, (which anyone applauds with all his heart) and I'm sure he captured the atmosphere of the day with precision. But it is presented so immature, too obvious, like a bat, it abysmally fails like a work of art. <br /> <br /> The only good performances here are by Paul Lukas, who brings sincerity and intensity to his role as a silently heroic anti-fascist; and Lucile Watson as the rich, amusing and rude grandmother, who slowly realizes how dangerous the world has become. Although their rootless education has subjected them to all kinds of difficulties, children are ridiculously shown as small, well-behaved robotic cuts. They do not even remotely resemble real human beings. And Bette Davis, a great actress, here is such a noble dimension that makes me shiver every time she is on the screen. Every word, every gesture of hers is meant to convey how SUPPORTIVE and UNDERSTANDING both of the SACRIFICES that her husband has to do and the GREAT CAUSE for which she is fighting, that she was wired to receive a painful electric shock if she dared allowed any trace of doubt or nuance to emerge in his portrait. <br /> <br /> So yes, this is a very IMPORTANT film, not really great.
