for those of you who are desperate to find out what happened to Twitch in the original movie, here's your chance, and then return to the real world. <br /> <br /> The guy who hid the gold in the first movie told Twitch, then he is transferred to another prison, where the wrestling champions wander around watching their embrace. Twitch plans to leave the prison in a month to get the gold to start a life with his woman. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone gets hit, and the movie turns into Die Hard in another prison. But the wrestler's daughter is involved in all this, so he and the twitch go to look for her and the Twitch woman. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the acting is below average, presents a lot of (really annoying) rap music and badly modified combat scenes. On the plus side, there is that Hispanic boy, who plays in every prison / action / thriller ever made, and closes a door in this. <br /> <br /> It is not very lively, but at least it is harmless. <br /> <br /> If you were a big fan of the original, that's fine. <br /> <br /> If not, you have been warned.
