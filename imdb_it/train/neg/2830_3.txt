If Ashanti had been a serious film attempt on the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries, the film could have been better received. Instead it turns into a star-studded disaster in a movie in which the stars arrive, they said their lines and collected their salaries without much conviction. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are committed to doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Peter Ustinov also arrives who can barely summon enough hams in him to play the part of the Muslim slave. Since Johnson is black, he still grabs her along with many children and some adults. <br /> <br /> Obviously Caine does not kindly accept the abduction and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has people like William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and the Indian movie star Kebir Bedi in parts and he looks so incredibly bored of everything. <br /> <br /> Usually in something as talented as the ones mentioned above, they simply exaggerate and shock the diet. But Ashanti doesn't even have it. <br /> <br /> What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of devaluing taxes is permeating the air.
