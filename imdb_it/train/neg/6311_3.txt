It's a bad film, very bad. <br /> <br /> Well, for people a realistic movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, bad, insignificant, meaningless at times. Perhaps this is why people say this film is real. Too many clich√©s: you're black, you're a criminal, you're doomed and cursed, whatever you do end up shooting or being shot by someone; don't let children play with weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before that, I hadn't seen such a bad movie. This is perhaps the reason why I never noticed how important photography is in a film. In this, every scene shot by day, outdoors, is clearly and annoyingly blue. They didn't even care about correcting the color balance. Oh! I have "evaluated" over 300 films in this database so far, and this (3/10) is my lowest ever.
