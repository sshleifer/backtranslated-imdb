IT MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ... BUT DOUBT CAN BE ACTUALLY SPOILED !!. <br /> <br /> Five Across The Eyes can be summarized in one word .... Amateur. This film tries to be different from most of the films from the Blair Witch type of film ... it doesn't work ... it ends up looking a bit like someone having a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie . The story has no explanations, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian who wears full power over the five girls) and there is no violence to talk about ... just the sounds of screams and crunch. The entire film takes place inside a van, which means that a decent scenario is out of the question. The five girls really do their best with what they have been given, but overall they appear to be rather terrible actresses ... even if with the given material it is difficult to judge whether they can actually aCt .... they pass EVERYTHING the film screaming, screaming and moaning ... so much that for half the time it's hard to understand what was said and the cameras are so bad that it's really hard to tell who said it. This video is portrayed as a violent torture film, but in reality there are only five girls in a van screaming in terror ... which literally sums up the whole film ..... we arrive at the end after what seem like 5 hours of screams constant and all five girls are still alive ... with one less finger. The only thumbs up (get it ... finger ... LOL) is for the poor actresses who tried thoroughly and probably lost their voices (and their pride) after making this terrible movie. Don't judge this by the poster ... you will be very disappointed.
