Easily the best known of all Shakespeare's plays, he was seriously disappointed here. Poor direction, stagnant studio work and irregular representations ruin a beautiful tragedy. <br /> <br /> In the city of Verona, the Capulets and the Montagues have been fighting for centuries, but the tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet . The bloodbath soon explodes ... <br /> <br /> The studio work, especially in the daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the game. It is a story that, with its energy, deserves to be filmed outdoors. Coupled with this the costumes are horrible, with too many pantyhose and ridiculous headgear. The theatrical combat seems horrendous, with too much tension and running to be engaging. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too light to be a truly effective Romeo. He manages the intensity of the character when the plot proceeds but his majestic accent and his bland, often expressionless look limit his reach. It is very difficult for the public to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she captures the naivety of the character but a little more sassiness would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> Secondary roles are not much better. Friar Laurence of Joseph O'Connor is fine, but many of his best lines have been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio is on stage and not on camera. It reacts and gestures excessively and consequently seems rather ridiculous. Alan Rickman, underestimating his role, has virtually no presence as a Tybalt. It has developed an edge and an intensity to provide some excellent screen performance in later years, but here it is not obvious. The prince may be a good role with his brief appearances but the actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give the party any authority over the camera. Only Michael Hordern, probably his best role in this series, comes out with dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Look at one of the other versions of this story instead.
