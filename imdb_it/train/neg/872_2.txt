First of all, I expected "Caged Heat" to be on the same lines as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, I'm wrong! In no way the exploitation of the film of the '70s, "chix in chains", or "women in prison". Of course, the plot is composed of a group of women in prison, who wear street clothes (quite comical), but NOTHING happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong rivalries, no one tries to seduce the guardian or doctor to try to escape and no prisoner does. There are 2 shower scenes, which I suspect is just a recycled footage, but no fights break out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! Apart from the lack of plot, unconvincing, obnoxious and flat characters, do a couple of prisoners who manage to escape actually return to prison to "free" their fellow prisoners? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the film should have ended with the fugitives fleeing towards sunset ... as opposed to letting this mess continue! <br /> <br /> I feel cheated.
