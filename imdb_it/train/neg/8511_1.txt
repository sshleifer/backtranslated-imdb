I could not, for the life of me, follow, understand or understand the story. As the plot progresses, it remains incomprehensible. I'm going to guess and say that there was a pre-production plot / story problem that was never solved. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the other idea, which was to make a film about a serial killer and the killer hunt by the police. They ended up with too many things happening in a time limit for the feature film. Too bad because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move and excellent cinematography. Indeed, a well made film that you could enjoy and relax with a couple of hours.
