Don't get me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was a boy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran made a bad film about the incredible story of Dan Jansen, because the true The story of Dan Jansen is truly incredible! Especially when you watch this film through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong, the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate, their technique, the size of the speedskating oval, it's all wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
