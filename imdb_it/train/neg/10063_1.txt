Now I've never seen a bad movie in all my years but what it is with the songs in the movie that physiological meaning has. WOW, some demented Pokémon show up and multiply to get an attack from it. The animation is useless, the creators of it are useless, it's a great marketing plan that seems to cut only on the songs and will have a good evaluation. I think this movie would have been fine if they sent a message to see all the Pokémon episodes to understand what's going on and it's not a movie. It's just an animation that should be on the video. Ps: I will give a 1 because I have just received 5 dollars, I could not give it half because there are no halves.
