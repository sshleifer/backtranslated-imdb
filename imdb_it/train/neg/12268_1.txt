I saw about four other Japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive. However, I could sense that there was a sensible script that leads the way. <br /> <br /> Not here, in any way. This is a detective who is trying to tie up similar murders that happened. When he finds a suspect to question, the suspect gets scared because he continues to see a ghost. So, the ghost starts following the detective around FOR A REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND REQUIRES MORE THAN THE FILM. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad? Oh no The film continues to change perspective to different characters who don't have much to do with the story. I've seen it before in other films where it shows a different perspective. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, whatever is happening on the screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends. For example, there are some scenes with a slight instrumental score that accumulates and ... so it just cuts another scene. I am aware that this can be a dramatic effect. It's definitely not the intention here. It's just bad editing. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the "ghost" who screams only in a way that is not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and a lot happens during the movie. <br /> <br /> All fears have been done before in better ways, so you can see them all coming. So, after one of these, the film is finished. At that point, a wave of confusion swept the audience as I felt that we all felt we had lost time. Someone gave a fake applause and the laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. In a nutshell, AVOID.
