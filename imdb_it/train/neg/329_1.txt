First: I bought it at the video store. Second: I looked at it. Third: it was boring. Fourth: it wasn't funny Fifth: most of the antics were lame. And last but not least: it's not just a bad movie, it's a total fiasco. <br /> <br /> I am a big Adam Sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten movie. I'm sorry because it was your first movie. Even if you are a big Adam Sandler fan, don't worry about watching this movie. Instead, just take the video, board a yacht and throw it overboard.
