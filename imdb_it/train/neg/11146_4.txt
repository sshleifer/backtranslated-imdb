Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't really feel robbed of my rent money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing bright or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is nice. The direction is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf film is a big problem. There was a fair amount of nudity, which for me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that exciting. All in all, it's a rather average direct movie to video, not the worst movie I've ever seen and if you're bored by a fan of the genre, take a look sometimes. I would look at it again. <br /> <br /> The bonus facts for horror fanatics, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in some of them) plays the werewolf.
