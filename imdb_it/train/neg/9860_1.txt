I usually like movies like this. It is shot in documentary style, but acting and writing are simply horrible. The acting is wooden and rigid and the writing is so trivial, but not quite in a good way. From this, I'm surprised it's 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I'm sure most of these votes must come from the relatives of the people in the film. I suppose, if that were the case, you could handle a few laughs, since it's always fun to see your relatives / friends make a movie. Well, in a sense, I imagine this gives hope to all writers, directors, actors, etc., because if they can do it, you can do it. Even if maybe you shouldn't.
