I went to see this movie with my 17 year old. daughter. I insisted that we go and show the matinee, not because I am a tightwad, but only by feeling myself. In the NASCAR spirit, this is a sponsor's dream. So much brazen advertising, it almost qualifies as info-merciale, if it weren't for the so-called acting. Keeping the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its style plots, the car is just a "vehicle" (not a pun) for this ballot of a movie. The previous episodes of Herbie (even if made of cheese) were produced in more serious times, making them a little easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, the queen of Disney's reigning drama, has few acting skills. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would get involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger scam!
