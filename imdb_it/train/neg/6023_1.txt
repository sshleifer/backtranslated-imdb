This reminds me of when I was a reborn believer who was about to become a minister. I never really thought that I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost sure I would be kidnapped in Paradise before it could happen. It was before I discovered that Christianity was a pile of garbage. I am now an atheist and this shows that the doctor "always saved saved" that the Christians tell us is no longer real than the elves. If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devotee born of a new believer? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed those stupid sinners who prayed with all my heart. <br /> <br /> If Christians read their Bible they find out that their god thinks how rape, genocide, abortion and many other atrocities are all right for him. They might be surprised to learn that there is no mention of "kidnapping".
