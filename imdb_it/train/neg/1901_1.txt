This review may contain some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 car chase movie Gone in 60 Seconds starts well. It is actually well acted and the plot moves quite well. But even a big Hollywood budget doesn't change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For the uninitiated, the original plot had the thieves who worked as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But also with a change in almost every aspect of H.B. The original of Halicki, the remake is a great film, until we reach the final scene of the chase, the part of version 74 that made it exceptional. The one in this version is watered down, only 10 minutes, and culminates in a special monster effect that eliminates any credibility from the hunt. Where the original chase was very credible, the star was an acrobatic pilot who did all his bravado, the remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car chase movie, perfect the original in the business basket at your local rental town and stay away from the new remake.
