I have just seen this movie and what a waste of time. The film was predictable and slow. They are basically the bad Mormon news that they play at church sanctioned basketball. Rather than watch this movie, I should have had a root canal. The cameo performances were obviously guided by sponsorship / funding. This film had potential due to the scandalous behavior exhibited by Mormons when they play church-sanctioned basketball, however because it is classified as PG, the true nature of the show cannot be transferred to the cinema. The acting is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was completely useless.
