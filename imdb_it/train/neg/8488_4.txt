Understanding virtual reality, the potential of computers, communication with the past, the constant struggle to express one's identity in a constrictive society and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace portrayed by the charming Tilda Swinton, this film should have been exceptional. But it's bad, terrible if you consider the potential! The acting - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - goes from tolerable to atrocious. The construction of the plot is nothing short of embarrassing - the programmer of today is a monotonous and boring character, but half of the film is dedicated to the creation of his character, and then when Ada finally appears, it is to narrate the events of his life, don't present a compelling story (Swinton touches on this, though). You never know her as a real person, just an icon of a college student's diary. <br /> <br /> Digital effects, like a digital dog and a bird, are bad and distracted, considering that it was 1997 and not 1985. And, finally, the script is simply bad. Bad dialogue, often pretentious - in particular the fighting between the programmer and his fianc√©, which made me argue - cold and distant characters, and the zero attempt to create a sense of wonder. The programmer successfully contacts a person in the past! Amazing! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "Well, be careful." (Although we are not given any clues then or later because it could be dangerous, and it never seems to be actually dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Furthermore, although it is a computer and Ada Lovelace and her love for mathematics, it is clear that no one involved in the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any reference to these topics is presented as a complete jumbo mumbo that challenges any suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> A scene, towards the end of the film, is quite good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton that expresses her sadness for the fragility of life, but her joy in that life. Touching, passionate and insightful, he seems to have come out of another film. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed with this film, because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may want to rent it but be notified. Watch Orlando for another much better exam of gender roles in history with a great Tilda Swinton show. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / question: * * <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Ada asks that her memories are not preserved (in what I thought was the best scene of the movie). But then the modern programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories into his little girl (hence the title of the film). Am I right, that the programmer violated Ada's wishes without even fighting? Or is this another confusing plot point that I'm misinterpreting?
