It was Sunday night and I was waiting for the film advertised on TV. They said it was a comedy! The film has started, 10 minutes have passed, after 30 minutes and I haven't laughed even once. The fact is that the film is finished and I haven't even had the echo of laughing. PLEASE, someone tickles me, I lost 90 minutes for nothing.
