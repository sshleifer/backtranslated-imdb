I like Fulci's films, I do it really and not in a boring way, but I recognize that they seem hopelessly inept and tangled to many people. <br /> <br /> Conquest is where Fulci engages with the epic fantasy genre and has not really happened. Structurally, it's like most Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, other things happen and occasionally one scene could be linked tangentially to another. He really is like Conan with no set, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is barely an actor), without a budget, stupid pet dogs and a lot of blood. <br /> <br /> This was a difficult one to overcome and I could have lived without the thumb of Vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that Hair Metal music video look.
