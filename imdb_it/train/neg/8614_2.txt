I must confess I was never a Rodney Dangerfield fan. In fact, he gets "no respect" from me. I only saw him because my wife wanted to see him, and he found exactly what I expected: a stupid story with no real humor. It is full of trivial, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot that revolves around the plans of a developer (Dangerfield) to build a ski resort in Utah that has not caught my attention. <br /> <br /> In addition to Dangerfield the film starred in a weak cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (I didn't even know it was still around until I saw his name in the credits for this. ) <br /> <br /> This is truly a Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
