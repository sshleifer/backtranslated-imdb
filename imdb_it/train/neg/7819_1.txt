... This would be the worst movie I've ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied to Boogeyman then. Very bad, really terrible. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations and couldn't meet them! I honestly can't think of a good thing. so here are the worst points ... <br /> <br /> 1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics .... seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally .... 6. THE PLOT <br /> <br /> There are so many unanswered questions, they made a 2:32 hour long movie and then they realized that they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were they forced to settle for the 3-minute piece or did they really think that no one would notice that the main hero and villain have less time on the screen than the son of Superman and the henchman he kills? !! <br /> <br /> Was it half the budget spent persuading Kevin Spacey to do so? <br /> <br /> When Superman goes to the hospital, why don't the doctors ask "What F *** do you want us to do ?! He's a fucking alien! We don't know Jack of his anatomy!" <br /> <br /> What happened in the 5 years that Superman left to advance the technology for 28 years? <br /> <br /> Where did the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie? <br /> <br /> and finally, why? Just because? <br /> <br /> BTW, for those of you who wonder why Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, I think I understand ... <br /> <br /> ... from superman it's not influenced by kryptonite until he sees something green between the rocks, it's clearly all in his head. so the thing of the continent is only he who suppresses his fear of a shiny green rock ... or that or writers are half idiots who didn't think it was a fairly obvious mistake.
