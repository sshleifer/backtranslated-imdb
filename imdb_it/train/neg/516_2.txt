Have you ever noticed how in his latest films, Burt Reynolds' laughter sounds like shrill brakes? <br /> <br /> Must have come out with Hal Needham too. <br /> <br /> And from the look of "Stroker" Ace ", too. <br /> <br /> Can you believe that this is based on a book? I wasn't either, but it was. And probably not a best seller, I bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another good guy on the NASCAR circuit who joins Beatty like a fried chicken tycoon with his team's designs, Anderson provides the interest amoroso that there is and Nabors makes his umpteenth impression to Gomer Pyle as faithful mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt or Hal, others must have needed work. even the real NASCAR pilots enter the field and seem to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As for the laughter, Bubba Smith (pre "Police Academy") takes them as Beatty's driver And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, receives many flattering gratitude as a woman who wants to get to know Lugs very well .. TRUE GOOD <br /> <br /> It's a pity that Burt ab Bia threw away so much time and effort in a movie like "Stroker Ace" where it didn't matter if he had taken the trouble to behave or not. They didn't bother writing a character for him, why bother acting? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for Petersen and for out-takes at the end. Now they are fun.
