It's not just the plot that makes this film a turning point for a bored audience. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and the left and right errors that make this too distressing to watch. I'm sorry but I don't see the 'fun' in this. Only the thrill of pointing to the many mistakes and stupid jokes. Well, I wonder how stupid the directors think of their company when this film was first presented. Probably as stupid as that sheriff who immersed himself in the pickup filled with antifreeze with a gaping bleeding wound. Oops! I forgot to mention that this sheriff is not only a poor actor, but can he also shake off an impale with a load of antifreeze that soaks the exposed meat? I guess he forgot when he won a not so exciting victory on the snowman.
