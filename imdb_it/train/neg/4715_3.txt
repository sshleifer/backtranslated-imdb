Recently I was looking at Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it. I failed, horribly. Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make their shows entertaining by all types of audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The writing is incredibly predictable, and the racing gags are not gags at all. Kids will love it, and that's all. <br /> <br /> Now, this does not mean that everything is negative. The original initial theme was actually quite catchy, but for some reason they took the skeleton and figuratively crushed it with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame, because it was really one of the best elements he had. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could be very interesting, in theory. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. Then again, this makes it easier for children to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is a little too fast. The episodes are too busy, leaving little time for intelligent writing. This is a real shame, because there are so many interesting concepts that the show carries on. On the upside, however, the fast pace will prevent children from losing interest, and this is really the entirety of the target audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show looks very good on paper, but it just doesn't make it be fun or interesting. This is a show that I like, but I can't. There is so much potential that is not realized. Kids will have fun, but that's all.
