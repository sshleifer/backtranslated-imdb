I imagine that if you are fond of science fiction and horror it might be interesting. The acting was ok but not exceptional. The two pregnant girls should be fifteen, but they are played by obviously older actresses who were at the time 21 years old. The plot is ok, but the story is a bit skipped, suggesting you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use the warp speed between the two. The Catholic church is depicted as a secret sect to investigate events that occur only to those of that faith. What if the two girls were Protestants? Would they treat Catholics? So some of what was invented. Who knows, one day the Catholic Church could even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, don't feel you have lost something.
