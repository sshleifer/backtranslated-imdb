This film is like real life, by which I mean: not much happens in the two hours available, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the often invisible cast (their invisibility is due to "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /> <br /> A great bore. It is no great surprise that Altman takes it into account - he is a very variable artist (yes, we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter", someone? Kansas City? Dr. T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham fairy tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the growing darkness of your insistent sleep - really makes it a masterpiece of bad film. And no, it's not "so bad it's fine". <br /> <br /> It's just ugly.
