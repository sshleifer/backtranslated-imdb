Nacho Vigalondo is very famous in Spain. It's kind of a bad showman that can make you sick ... Very embarrassing. Nacho had done some commercials on TV, I remember one in which Nacho was looking for Paul Mc Carney around Madrid (the advertisement concerned a CD collection by Mc Carney). <br /> <br /> This little film is like a Nacho commercial: evil plot, bad direction and horrible performances. I can't believe a disgusting movie like this was in The Kodak Theater. Poor Oscar ... <br /> <br /> Nacho could make this film because of his wife, the producer of this 7:35, a woman very well connected with the businessmen of Spanish TV.
