Ronald Reagan and a group of US soldiers in a North Korean prison camp. They are tortured ... We learn that the communists of North Korea are bad people ... We learn the beards of Americans grow very slowly during the days of torture ... <br /> <br /> I tried to suppress it, but to I ended up laughing at this movie. It was the scene where Mr. Reagan came out of telling the communists he wanted to be on their side. So, ask for a bottle of brandy. Then, acting soberly sober, he takes a drunken comrade, Dewey Martin, to get the sulfur to cure Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean communist guard is as stupid as it comes. Thus, the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes to get something from a drawer, which is next to a pile of empty boxes. I'm sure the boxes had to contain something; but, of course, Reagan makes them tremble enough to reveal that they are empty. Ya gotta laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" is aimed primarily at the family and friends of those who worked on it, otherwise it is a waste. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
