Where is that sequel written to suck? Scream 2 no! Others don't! But this certainly has ... the problems include horrible actors (only Christopher Walken could act throughout the film), bad writing (you'll never understand what's going on and I've also done research on the idea of ​​Nephilim first), and just horrible choices for casting. Eric Roberts makes the stupid Archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague unless you want to see Christopher Walken. In that case, go ahead quickly towards the parts in which it is in the film and avoid the others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
