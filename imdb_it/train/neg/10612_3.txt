Wow, what a great premise for a film: set it around a director with the block of the writer who decides to take tango lessons. Hey, and what an even better idea has the central role for a director interested in tango. Damn, I wish I had that talent for genius. Yes, I'm sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this kind of zero potential for making money films is done. Come on, unless you are a fan of the rabid tango (I admit they exist judging from the comments) or a tough member of Sally Potter's fan club (?) There is nothing in this film that will plunge you to the cinema to see it. Even if you are in tango, much of the film is occupied by meaningless scenes like a house being renovated or a man in a wheelchair traveling down a street <br /> <br /> Coming soon THE REVIEW LESSON where a screenwriter failed from Scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but very funny reviews of movies he has seen. Gasp in shock as Theo Robertson puts the boot in Hollywood's last hits, cries in sympathy as he receives yet another rejection letter from a movie company, falling into lust while bathing and soaping up his well toned body. REVISION LESSON soon in a cinema near you if someone is stupid enough to fund the movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not connected to Harry Potter
