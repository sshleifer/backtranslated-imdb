I come from the Dallas / Fort Worth area and lived in Arlington for a few years. This film was far to make Arlington look like. I saw mountains in the background of a scene! Texas has no mountains. I imagine this happens when a film that should be in Texas is shot in Canada. Even the accents are really bad. They should have gotten actors from Texas to play the parts. There's a lot of aspiring actors from Texas to Hollywood. The film is really sad, because it's a true story. I pray that the killer be found and condemned. The only good thing is that, after his death, we have the Amber Alert to help find the missing children quickly after being kidnapped.
