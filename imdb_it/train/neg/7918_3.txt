I found the writing in this film absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saved this film from me by classifying it as 1 in 10 was the performance by Lacy Chabert that I thought had played multiple personalities very well. For me it was definitely the best part of this movie. <br /> <br /> Dina Meyer was as pretty as ever, but I found her role rather bland, so I don't think her acting could be said to be great. <Br /> <br /> As for the male protagonist, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of the doctors of the 1980s cheese series. <br /> <br /> Everything I could live with. However the terrible, terrible, terrible end / solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of the psychic were just some of the worst writings I've seen in a long time.
