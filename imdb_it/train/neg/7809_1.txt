Definitely a strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling around him. Cecil takes a column, checks the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's house and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and to have Jesus in her heart. This makes everything much better. Ah ... if only everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "movie" seems to be made with around $ 500 certainly doesn't help. 1/10
