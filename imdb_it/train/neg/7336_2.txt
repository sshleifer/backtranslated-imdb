This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare's most vibrant dramas. I can only assume that the intent was to make the game as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has never been exposed to Shakespeare before. In this way, however, by making each line clear and every intent evident, they dried up the game of life and turned it into a flat caricature. In some ways, it's really boring - a very difficult undertaking given such wonderful material. <br /> <br /> Acting is at best forgettable - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro. Others, however, do not go so well. April Shawnham's Hero is a sullen, breathless airhead that often makes faces. Don John of Jerry Mayer is a nonsense cartoon character at the Snidely Whiplash level (although Snidley was much more fun). <br /> <br /> F. Murray Abraham (you know, the guy who killed Mozart?) It's not in this version, unless it was in disguise and his name was removed from the end credits. <br /> <br /> Since the producer, Joseph Papp, is basically a god of theater, this production is not only disappointing, but also scratches his head. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this. Look at Branagh's Much Ado instead - his version is full of vitality and humor, not to mention wonderful shows.
