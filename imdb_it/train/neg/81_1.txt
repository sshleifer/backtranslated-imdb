Life has done it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was meaningless. The acting was terrible! Especially from teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just trying desperately to give the actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. A long time ago a good movie, this is not one of those. Unless one has nothing else to do, I would avoid this at all costs. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have preferred to scrape my face against a brick wall for two hours, then dipped it in the peroxide. It would have been more fun.
