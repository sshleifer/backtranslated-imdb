Strictly a routine, from the western numbers (directed by the musical genre of Andrew V. McLaglen, is that so there is wonder?). Army colonel Brian Keith stands up with bandit brigand Dean Martin, who has just kidnapped Colonel's wife (Honor Blackman, who never found his niche after playing Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger"). Fistfights, shootings, stagecoach robberies and Denver Pyle in a supporting role ... in other words, absolutely nothing new or original. Speaking in a low and monotonous tone, Keith goes mad with a prostitute (a sort of shock after his "Family Affair" TV run), but otherwise this low-cost material wastes Keith's lovely talents. It's also bad news for Dino, who doesn't seem to notice or worry about it. Bad direction, bad writing and a few amusing lowball humor attempts. * from ****
