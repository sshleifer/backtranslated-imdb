Holy @ #% and this film was still hot and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to look at this heap of garbage but found it easier to cut my wrists and hit a Lysol floor cleaner shooter than to endure more than half of the crap that was on my screen. I rate it far below anything I've ever seen on film or TV, and that's something he says. Once I saw a shit of cows in a field. I looked at the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... it may have moved or something. Well, it was better to spend time than to watch this tripe. The acting was non-existent, the plot was elsewhere than this film. I think I saw a cut seen right away where the plot managed to escape and was running away in the background on the back of an old truck headed for Portland in hopes of becoming a reporter Steven King. Please tell me the director is receiving drugs he desperately needs. It is quite clear that he needs heavy medicine and I would like to come to terms with the money needed for his reversal of lobotomy. Bah ... I can't give this review the full punch it needs because nothing so painful can ever be done justice in the mere word. Let me tell you that if you are looking for a movie to spend some time and you see this Chilton on the rack, go to your car, start the engine, then push both your fists straight into the fan until you feel your bones vibrate more. Make sure you have the wallet in your hands as well because you would have wasted your money anyway. You could also have the privilege of wasting it alone. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw him after a "friend" of mine sent his girlfriend to see her. HE has come, too. The worst thing is that he had to watch this $% and @ what twice! I heard their marriage now and he goes to visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
