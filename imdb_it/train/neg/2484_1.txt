I still can't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of shit. This film is worse than "Deadly Friend". The plot is stupid, acting is mediocre and the film is deadly boring. I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut "Last House on the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and I like (probably) this turkey. I'm not wrong, I really like some of his films, but it was a real torture to sit and watch This.
