"Laughter is a state of mind," says the tag, and I hesitated to comment on Barry Levinson. What could he have thought during the creation of "Toys"? When you saw the rushes, did you see a fun and successful fantasy? If so, then he is working on a plane other than I. This is a piercing picture, in which production design is 90% of the thing (and even cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as the brother and sister of a toy tycoon who is bypassed as heir to the factory when their father dies. There is nothing strange (satirical or slapstick-wise) on display here. It is uniformly draggy, ugly and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. NO STARS from ****
