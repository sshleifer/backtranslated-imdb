After reading the previous comments, I'm glad I wasn't the only person confused, especially in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine is shown twice walking in a tomb and closing the lid behind him. I anxiously awaited some sort of explanation for this strange behavior ... naturally I thought it had something to do with the evil that was happening at home, but since he was killed by the first rising corpse (hereinafter referred to as Zombi # 1) , these scenes made absolutely no sense. Please, if anyone out there knows why Carradine continued to dig into the tombs - leave the rest of us! <br /> <br /> All the action is limited to the last 20 minutes, so I'll try a synopsis. John Carradine goes out to the graveyard to investigate and is strangled by Zombie # 1. So far so good. But then comes the confused scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler, out for a little moonlight in the cemetery, discover Carradine's body. Strickler repeatedly tries to push Ireland into the open grave from which Zombie no. 1, but Ireland manages to make him fall into the open grave, and SOON! Strickler comes out as Zombie # 2! Yes, I guess we can deduce that Strickler was dead all the time (a witch?), But the reason he moved from normal to putrefying by flying into the grave of Zombie # 1 was never explained. (Considering how terribly slow these zombies are, I thought he would have preferred to remain in his "normal" form until the end of his business). This scene also brings a question to mind - only who the hell is Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the original murder victims shown during the opening credits of the film, but who knows which one, or why he has a particular grudge against the film crew. <br /> <br /> In any case, after Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, we see EXACTLY THE SAME HIT OF Zombie # 2 that is making its way through the trees as we have seen for Zombie # 1. (This leads to a momentary confusion as to how MANY zombies there really are. Then, in the best horror movie of the 50s, Ireland manages to escape while fleeing. He comfortably bumps his head on the small headstone of Faith Domergue's dead cat (wasn't it that John Carradine's sculpting a tombstone for a cat he barely knew?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Zombie # 1 is destroying chaos at home. He easily sends three members of the film crew, then starts the stairs. Faith Domergue feels it, and thinks that the lover John Ireland, back from his night service, goes out. After seeing that it is only Zombie # 1, he shouts and retreats into a bedroom where he retrieves the Irish revolver. While the star Carole Wells is taking a shower at this point and can't hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who is drinking and making fun of a mirror in her bedroom) does it. Taking his sweet time (and only after a few drinks from his flask) he finally decides to investigate. (One thing that strikes the viewer during the last quarter of this film is how SLOW TO REACT the stars are screaming and gunshots). Domergue is back in the hallway armed and ready, but Macauley is wrong for Zombie # 1 and shoots him six times! He makes a nice acrobatic jump over the railing, then a horrified Domergue steps back, straight into his arms waiting for Zombie # 1. <br /> <br /> Carole Wells is now out of his shower and dries when he hears gunshots and screams from Domergue; she too does not have much urgency to rush out to investigate. So during this time Zombie # 1 has time to tighten Domergue from the neck with a rope. Wells sees the suspended corpse of Domergue and faints dead. The next time we see her she is in a stream outside the home (???) - but we will talk about it later. Meanwhile, Ireland has recovered its senses and stumbles into the house where it discovers the bloody carnage of Zombie # 1. Although Ireland has just run into 3 people killed, it is more worried that its film has been exposed and ruined! Fortunately for him (and the public), Zombie # 1 throws some film material on his head from the second floor. This is the last one we see on Zombie # 1. At this point the audience receives a montage of all the deaths, showing that the new ones "mirror" the old ones. How deep is it. <br /> <br /> Zombie # 2, meanwhile, has approached the house (remember, these zombies move slowly like molasses in January) where it happens to see Carole Wells floating in a stream and fish her out. How did it get there? Zombie no. 1 dragged her down, threw her in, then zoomed upstairs again just in time to wipe out John Ireland? Apparently one of the original victims had drowned in the tank, so even Wells has to drown (but because outside in a stream, instead of in the pool, it is never explained). Zombie # 2 never enters the house alone (they're all dead by now, anyway, thanks to Zombie # 1), but instead brings Carol Wells back to the cemetery. As the credits flash on the screen, we see Zombie # 2 with his dead love still in his arms, descending into the open grave. <br /> <br /> The spectator is left to ask himself: Yes, but wasn't this Zombi The tomb number 1? Why is Zombie # 2 moving away? And if Zombie # 1 arrives and wants to go back - will Zombie # 2 leave it or will there be a zombie fight? Will the zombies share both the grave and the late Carole Wells? And as for now-dead John Carradine - where will he stay? After all, we know from the previous scenes that he is clearly at home in the grave ... If this synopsis plot of the ending left you confused, don't worry because you're not alone.
