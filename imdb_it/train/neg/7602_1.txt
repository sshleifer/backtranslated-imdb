One of the other commentators said they were almost out. If I had not been with my wife, who wanted to stay, I would have left. It's also a shame, because I think it could have been a good movie. But this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays I've ever seen. It does not start anywhere and goes nowhere (I would say that it does not go anywhere quickly, but in reality it does not proceed very slowly ... painfully slow). From time to time there are suggestions that something interesting might happen, or that there is potentially some depth under one of the characters, but that's all we get - suggestions. There is no single award or revelation in the entire film. Not that I need a smooth plot to be entertained ... I love a good study of sinuous character as the next independent enthusiast. But these characters add up to nothing. For the entire duration of the film, you don't care what happens to just one of them. In fact, you almost begin to hope that they die, because at least one death could be more interesting than observing their inexplicable behavior, which is so strange and unpredictable that you think it would be irresistible in itself, but it is not. Instead of bizarre, noir-esquire characters who act in a hard-boiled way, it is immediately recognized for what it is: a group of talented but mixed actors, who broods and raises their eyebrows while reading a bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context . All this for two compelling, painfully slow hours. Terrible.
