I'm ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most saving factor for owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My vote for this film is a big fat ZERO. Don't get me wrong, I'm a horror girl. but I want some meat behind the story, not to mention I prefer that evil happens to humans, not to be deceived to look, what seems to be forever, snuff clips. Acts of brutality interrupt the painfully long silence and mediocre acting. If I had to make a comparison with another film, the only one that comes to mind is the Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, useless and a completely uncomfortable watch.
