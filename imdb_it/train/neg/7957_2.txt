Whoa. In the twin cities, we have a station that shows a "Big Bad" movie from Monday to Friday. Tonight's nugget was a film with Carrie Fisher called "She's Back" about a really annoying woman who ends up being killed when the thugs break into her house. Bea (Beatrice) returns to persecute her husband. He wants him to seek revenge on his killers, so "she is back". And she won't let him rest until he does. She irritates him to infinity ... and also to the spectators! This movie is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hey, I like bad movies, though (my favorite movie is Xanadu). I was really shaking my head all over the film, wondering who he thought would be a good idea for a movie. Bea is so annoying. The plot is silly; acting is bad; the story ... well, you understand. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, take a look at it. You will not be disappointed. Eh.
