I agree with everything people have said about this, but I must add that the soundtrack is probably the WORST I have ever heard all my life! There are real voices during the moments when you should hear the actors talking! And the voices are like a broadway version of Danzig singing: "The darkness of the forest! Oh the darkness of the dark and dark forest!" or something else so threatening. The singer has a terrible vibrato and was recorded with a triple microphone on some sections of synthesized strings and fake drum rhythms. It's horrible!! <br /> <br /> Yes, male contacts are horrible. So are women. This is a bad case of gender stereotypes: it's so ugly! Everything they say revolves around being a boy or a girl, only by playing stereotypes to the maximum. It makes me sick. Soooo boring !!! <br /> <br /> The children were so eclectic in their lines, you couldn't understand them. And why do female ghost children always wear pretty little bows in their hair, beautiful blue clothes and long hair? And do the ghost boys always wear clean-cut trousers with pretty shiny blond hair? Not scary - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Dad's face was too imperfect and clean to be that of a man living in a cave. Beautiful beard and fringe, pa. Did you cut them perfectly with a knife or did you go to town and go to the salon? <br /> <br /> Stupid movie.
