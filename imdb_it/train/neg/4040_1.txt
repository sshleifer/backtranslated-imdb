I consider myself a bit snobbish when it comes to everything and even if the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than to drama, I can be very involved in the movies too. <br /> <br /> Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I'd probably give Kong two stars, double the loot of this movie. My hypothesis is that people got excited about it because it was almost identical in style to what can be seen in a play. For less demanding art lovers, a film that looks like a play is "great art". <br /> <br /> This film, however, was useless. <br /> <br /> There was almost no story so it was based on high drama. The only drama in this film was whether the cat would fall off the roof or not. So, a deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting? Hardly. <br /> <br /> Being excessively honest: some of the landscapes were interesting, however: communist apartments, city views (Petersburg?) and Soviet trams still in service.
