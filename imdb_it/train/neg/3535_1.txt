All right. Who was? Who gave Revolver 10 out of 10? Are you tripping over your head on Ecstasy tubes? There were so many of you. Did you do it for courage? Is this a kind of cult? Or has Guy Richie himself signed 788 times with different names? <br /> <br /> Before I say anything else, I'll say it. Just because you don't understand a movie doesn't mean it's not great. Maybe you had a bad day at work, or you sat down to watch a movie after you had a fight with your wife and then you didn't feel like it. Perhaps there is a more fundamental obstacle - as if you did not have the mental capacity or a sufficiently developed philosophical sense to interact with it. BUT. And this is very, very big but. The mega size XXL for elephants, but to top it all crazy. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, don't confuse inconsistency with complexity, and please don't confuse this two-hour non-squirter for an interesting film. Really. You might think you're smart enough. You might even think of yourself as a romantic figure: an independent thinker who supports a masterpiece against a chorus of sheeplike opponents. Please don't do this. You're embarrassing yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is a waste of time for everyone. If I thought about it for a few minutes you would recognize it too. It was a waste of the cast, a waste of the crew, a waste of restaurateurs, and certainly a waste of precious minutes (you can't get them back you know) of anyone unlucky enough to sit in the midst of this unspeakable, miserable mess. <br /> <br /> "No - wait", a voice arrives in the darkness. "I simply do not understand, it is NON-LINEAR, this means that the story does not go into a STRAIGHT LINE, this is actually the COMPLEX and THIN work of an AUTEUR. It faces difficult EXISTING questions. CLUB when it first came out - you don't heard? "" Because they couldn't cope with COMPLEXITY, they're eating humble pies now. Bet you also hate Lynch's films, doncha? <br /> <br /> I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a big Lynch fan. rather Memento, so a narration narrated in an unconventional way does not necessarily fill me with fear. And although I studied it only briefly a few years ago, philosophy interests me a lot. I don't like Revolver for these reasons. be heavy and big-brained subjects, but treats them so superficially insulting as to be ridiculous, I'm not much of a chess player, but Richie's idea of ​​how chess works seems to be and that of an early four year old child. I don't like it because the characters, without exception, have totally alienated me. "Aha!" Richie's apologist cries. "Guy is cleverly reversing Brecht's hat!" Maybe you're right. I think it's more likely that he won't be able to write a decent coffee script. <br /> <br /> The comparison between Revolver and Fight Club is actually very instructive. Fight Club has an acid-linguistic nihilistic dialogue that makes you laugh. Revolver has a luck stent that rejects the one-liners that make your ears bleed. Fight Club has a big breakthrough that makes you re-evaluate all that has happened. Revolver has, as far as I can tell, several incomprehensible twists that offer no satisfaction because ... well, they don't make sense. If you keep pulling people out of the carpet, they will eventually get you out of the house. And then they block all the doors and windows. And they never made you come back inside. Ever. <br /> <br /> Guy Richie seems to assume that being philosophical involves repeating a mantra of small buzz phrases. Most of them are spoken, but they often flash on the screen with attributions. It is almost pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this film particularly noteworthy is the way something so incomprehensible can be married so well with all the clichés of the world's tired gangsters. In the end it is so irrelevant. You don't care about anything. You do not understand anything. Go home. <br /> <br /> Actually, there was a bit I really liked: the tense killer who has a crisis of confidence. He is a great man. But I can't recommend you to watch the movie just to see it. He only works there for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Please, believe me. It's horrible.
