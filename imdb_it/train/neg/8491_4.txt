Despite some occasional original touches, such as the "virtual sets" that provide the backdrop for Victorian interiors with Ada Lovelace and her circle, this film is not up to par and ultimately does not disappoint. The newcomer Francesca Faridany seems talented, but she is wasted as Emmy, a character who in the middle of the film is reduced to nothing more than to stare at a monitor that looks at Lady Ada telling an autobiography. 'Conceive Ada' takes off briefly when Lady Ada (Tilda Swinton) appears; the camera focuses on his facial expressions, on his mannerisms, making it seem translucent or temporarily invisible, bringing scenes to dramatize Emmy's "virtual" rendering. <br /> <br /> A simple biographical film by Ada Lovelace would have been worth it, but unfortunately this film has a hash of the life of Lady Ada, and that of a modern computer scientist (and her brash and very sweet boyfriend) .
