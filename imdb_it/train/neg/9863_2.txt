Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his supreme grip on the subgenus of the Mockumentaries is not a problem of being overshadowed, especially not by this extremely unpleasant shot to role-playing players. The jokes are beyond the lame. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a species of SNL (particularly rancid), much less the atrocious 87 minutes that I observe this bully. The great William Katt (the greatest American hero, house) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing only makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and this is posting about it here, so I just hope I hope to save someone a bad experience. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 2 audio comments; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer <br /> <br /> extra DVD-Rom: 2 backgrounds <br /> <br /> Easter Egg: Highlight the eye in the main menu photo for a short scene
