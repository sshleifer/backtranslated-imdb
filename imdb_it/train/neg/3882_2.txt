Why do I constantly do it for me? I mean, really, it's right there in the title: "The Incredible Melting Man". What else would I expect? I have to admit that I'm a sucker for everything I find on the Monster HD channel, but the only thing that redeems this photo would be the truly grotesque trick of the legendary Rick Baker. As for the gruesome, I'll nod to that old old charlatan who sucks on lemons just before the lights go out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never have imagined in horror movies was why the victims of a monster would not simply run away from virtual annihilation. Like the chick in the cabin. You know, there was a door completely visible right in the kitchen that could have escaped at any time. Incredible Steve-O couldn't muster much more than a brisk walk, so why not just blow him? I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> This film had the feel of an episode of "Tales From The Crypt", but "Tales" usually had a cold or grotesque touch that you often didn't see coming. This was a picture you couldn't figure out how to get or go. For example, in one of the first scenes, you can clearly understand that Melting Man's eyeball fell off his head, so how did he wander around for the rest of the story? I guess we shouldn't ask. <br /> <br /> At eighty-four minutes, this photo was about an hour and a half too long. When it was all over, I was ready to occupy General Perry in his previous suggestion: "I could really use a drink right now."
