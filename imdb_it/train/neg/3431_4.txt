This is not as fun and bloody as the DVD box claims. I love twisted and weird movies, but this is really just boring! It's an hour of torn penises, baby born dolls flying and a lot of rape! I think the intention with this amateur amateur was to make a It's-so-bad-it-good movie, but it fails. It's just ugly! Some scenes are ok, but overall it's a mess. If you like amateur splatters like this (just a better way), I'd recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.
