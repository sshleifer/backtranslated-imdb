Get "Rambo", mix in some "Miami Vice", cut the budget by 80% and you have something that some ten-year-olds could come up with if they have a big enough yard and too big a "Penthouse" access. Policeman and ex-commando McBain (Busey, and with a name like McBain, you know he is as gritty as they are) is recruited to recover an American supertank that was stolen and hidden in Mexico. Captured with the tank they were written on the sergeant. Major O'Rourke (Jones) and the former love of McBain Devon (Fluegel), the commanding officer and now flesh for depraved terrorists / spies / drug dealers, who have no sense of decency, blah, blah, bla. For an action movie with depraved sex, there is a lack of action and not much sex. The joke is that McBain is shot all the time and survives, keeping the bullets as a souvenir. Apparently the writers did not see "The Magnificent Seven" ("Man for us is he who gave him that face"), nor did he think of giving McBain a fiction of intelligence. Even for a budget shareholder, production values ​​are scarce, with distant shots during the dialogue and very little movement. The main prop, the tank, is foolish enough for an Ed Wood production. Fluegel, who may have been a blonde Julia Roberts (she had a much more important role in Julia's "Crime Story"!) She has to go from a whisper to a scared one kicking and kicking back again on immediate notice. Jones, who has been in an incredible film series, has basically hit the bottom right here. Both he and Busey were probably out for some easy money and a few laughs. Look for the talented and future lead actor Danny Trejo ("Heat", "Once Upon a Time in Mexico") in a stereotypical, threatening part. Too boring even for a guilty pleasure, "Bulletproof" is still noisy enough to play when you leave the house, but you want people to think there's someone at home.
