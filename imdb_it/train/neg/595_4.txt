Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... well, yes, that's all for this movie. <br /> <br /> No real plot, no plot. No nice characters, well, the 'characters' are not correct considering that you have no idea who he really is. I mean, they're chased by some strange thing that appears in the sewers (who is this thing? Why is it there?), It's pretty scary, I think, but do I really care? No I do not know. Why not me? Because I have no idea who these people are and I don't know if I should want them to live or die. It's one-dimensional and relies on gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does. <br /> <br /> This film has no meaning, no purpose. I seem to have fallen asleep and lost the 45 minutes of accumulation. Jump straight to the action. Basically, some women and his friends are locked up in the London underground, chased by a strange creature, so they eventually manage to escape. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the position is excellent and the sounds are OK, but that's not what makes a decent horror movie, so unfortunately all this is wasted . <br /> <br /> This is nothing new. Another predictable modern 'horror', in which Kate (the 'main character') constantly makes the stupid "hey, I know that sitting at home I think I should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oh no! total opposite because they are a stupid blonde thing ". I wish they didn't, it's done so many times, it's boring and becomes predictable. In fact, I am quite annoyed that the stupid woman was not stabbed by the erm, gray-looking alien creature. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the line of demarcation of the films. Well, Creeps' journey ends only for a short while in the film. If you have drunk a couple of beers, you have a couple of companions in place, so surely, look at it by any means. But if you want something original and intelligent, avoid it.
