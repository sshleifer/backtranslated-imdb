From the first time I saw the cover of the movie box and the extended picture I thought this guy, this friend of the Scwarz had to be like 6 feet or 6 feet and 2 inches. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet tall. Not that, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> At each evaluation, I shot the film one cool evening in Tucson, out on the second floor with a good cigar and let it go. At that time my wife had an affair and things were going down for me, so I needed a good diversion. But, as much as the film was ... I loved it, even with a bottle of Merlot, I could admit. <br /> <br /> Really, I've watched this movie many times. It always makes me feel good !! It's not that "trying too hard" to be cool or that "It's so close" to hit the target for an action movie .... It's hectic. And then truly without trace. Then frantic again. It is the best of the best when it comes to a low-speed chase scene. Wow !! I've never felt safer in my life. Warm and happy too. I was grateful to have kept the gas during the chase, due to lower production in the summer months ... anything that the direction was "uninspired", the action and the fighting sequences had to be choreographed, or re-choreographed and strengthened, the sound was out of reach did not hit you, went ahead, on the other side. The "locals" of that village where they were, rather than the city, were "out of the chorus", but they didn't seem to follow what was happening very well, they looked and even "stared" into the camera lens. Like a deer in the head of lights, something just some of them with a smile, a smiling deer. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because "Columbu", I just bet, has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for their own compatriots. <br /> <br /> However, "Baretta's Island" is very lethargic and incredible. Although I really like it. My hour x-wife hates him, but I love it! <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that I am quite discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even "love". All in all, I like Franco. So here it is. <br /> <br /> Like a movie by adding an addendum to this if you like to kill a few hours with a real fun to watch, directly in the B video movies or "bad" for your small library collection, so if you can to find see "The Big Sweat" (1991) with Robert Z 'Dar ... you know the guy from "TANGO & CASH". 'The Big Sweat', a bomb of a detective story without a real plot and drama discovery that is so lame, could also be "on crutches" and at the end of "The Big Sweat" I think they ran out of money because they had a photo of the cast and they just burned it and let it burn during the credits. -Have fun. <br /> <br /> But all in all, not up to Baretta's Island, I gave a "1" and an overall "horrible" rating for the "B terrible" movie. I am waiting for the sequel, perhaps as "La vendetta di Baretta su Montazuma" (Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water, then declares war on water co.) Or "Baretta's powder war" where as he would have staked a great lord of drug in his country and a chemical-genetic link and create a hybrid super-insect (insect) that would be bred and dropped in cocaine fields and ate coca and, passing through the insect, forms a chemical reaction that turns into the pure coke with icing sugar. Then another sequel that should have led young people to escape from excessive sugar addiction and so on. He could have obtained an important toothpaste manufacturer to support and partially finance the project with a careful placement of the product in the function. Right?(*)
