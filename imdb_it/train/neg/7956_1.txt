This movie should be the number one at the bottom 100. Acting is so horrible that when my son and I looked at him we almost became physically ill. And the story is worse. I could go on forever about how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to frankbob's review since no one else bothered to do it again. Don't waste time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. Thank goodness, we saw it on TV, so we didn't spend anything. If we had it, I would have been forced to write the people responsible for this abomination and I would have been forced to launch an execution in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed looking at the Carrie Fisher act. But I am sad to say that it is not worth looking at this particular film. Don't ruin your opinion of Carrie by looking at her.
