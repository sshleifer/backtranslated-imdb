I had to see him at school. And to summarize ... <br /> <br /> Actors without talent, script without talent and a director without talent. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of your time. Don't even watch the movie. Don't worry. You'll be so disappointed. My teacher said it had to be good. How wrong it was. He even slept a little. The actors in the film were just bad. The best actor in there was the old man and he's not saying much. It has a horrible plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say that it didn't make sense. The script was emotionless and confusing. There were stitches in the film when I furrow my eyebrows and say "What?" Also there were too many loose bonds and holes in the plot. It was absolutely hideous.
