Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it a little? Having read the book on which this film is supposedly based a couple of years ago, I can say that there is little or nothing in the original book. I went to this movie with low expectations - I knew he would have a disgusting feeling of telemovie - but he couldn't even satisfy them. <br /> <br /> This is not a prequel - the only relationship he has with the original is the name. This is not the story of Carlito Brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who was given the same name. They just spit out completely in front of all Carlito's Way fans out there; adding insult to injury by launching Luis Guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original film, in a different role. <br /> <br /> What is most disappointing is that now that this film has been made, no other film will be made dealing with the original and intact material of the book Carlito's Way - something I wanted to see. I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worthy of fantastic non-fictional materials and could have made a brilliant biography of the most feared figure of the Australian underworld, instead they made a humor film about a deranged but strangely small pathetic idiot ( even though Eric Bana's performance was apt). Now we will never see the real rise and fall of Carlito. <br /> <br /> The three stars are because, looking at it exclusively as a movie in its own right, it's not so scary - there are some decent performances (Jay Hernandez is not Carlito but he could be good at other roles) and the story not bad. Puffy Combs also adapts to his role. But they completely misunderstood the nature of the underworld at the time (I'm a bit of a criminal non-fiction buff) - something that the original film and the books are right (having been written by the then lawyer and now judge Edwin Torres). <br /> <br /> The fact is, however, that it is not an isolated case: it is perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.
