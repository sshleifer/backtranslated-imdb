First of all this movie starts with a really stupid note: a 10 year old girl, playing in a moving vehicle, decides that it would be fun to cover her mother's eyes with her hands, and therefore causes a terrible accident that kills her mother .... duh .... sorry, there is positively a 10-year-old boy who is dumb. The rest of the film does not improve much. After the death of his mother by the apparently most stupid 10-year-old on the planet, his father moved his family to Genoa, Italy, where he had to teach at a local university, but here he was the forerunner: he didn't speak a word of Italian! Then the child has "visions" of mother (who killed), and often later night terrors that always end up with her father who holds her and cuddles her. Then we are forced to watch this family continually getting lost and then finding and then hugging and then crying and losing and then finding (naturally following more hugs and crying) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe out all these silly people and ignorant of the planet. Don't get me wrong, because I love indies, but an indie on stupid (and I mean really stupid) people is simply ridiculous and useless. It's really a shame that this film is based on characters so insipid that they move in such retarded scenarios, because the place was interesting.
