I admit that the problem I have with the famous Ealing films I have seen so far could be mine. For my taste, they are black and extravagant, or so clear in tone that they are unsatisfactory as comedies or stories. This is a very important way to say that I wanted "The man in the white suit", but I found myself struggling to sit in his short period of time. <br /> <br /> The textile worker Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) could be mild in his ways, but he is stubbornly committed to progressing in the form of his attempts to invent a lock of fabric that cannot be broken or soiled. Using a factory workshop for his latest experiment, he strives to limit both material and human limitations - the latter are the mill's optical leaders who do not understand what he is doing, then understand and become even more committed to stopping it. br /> <br /> "They are small minds like yours that obstruct progress", Sidney complains, practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to Man. <br /> <br /> A problem with "Man In The White Suit" is that the vision of Sidney's progress is terribly petty, even more than that of the bosses or workers who resent their work too. My problem is more elementary: for a comedy, "White Suit" is not fun. It is a rather serious script that tries too often to extract its weak attempts at humor from spit-take, duplication, triple-take and vertigo. <br /> <br /> The best joke is the sound of the car Sidney is dedicated to, going "Bleep-Blop-Bleep-Bop" without end and taking bizarre glances from every visitor until Sidney draws his miracle from it or it blows him up by looking. Like every other bit of humor that works decently in this film, it's supported too long. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Guinness less influential in a film, even though it seems incredibly young and serious (although actually in its mid-30s). He looks so bloodless, even more than the general with the wax face he played in "Doctor Zhivago". It is the same cold fish if it ignores the sad affections of the mill girl who offers to give him the savings of a lifetime when he loses his job (pan-faced Vida Hope as Bertha) or the more sultry charm of the young Daphne Birnley (Joan Greenwood), her only ally in her fight against "shabbiness and dirt", as she says, making those words look incredibly sexy as only Greenwood could. <br /> <br /> Player support makes "White Suit" work just as well. Ernest Thesinger of the reputation of "Bride Of Frankenstein" plays a singularly evil industrial captain who resembles Nosferatu and laughs like a death rattle. Howard Marion-Crawford as another factory chief is memorable here while playing a winked medical officer in "Lawrence Of Arabia". Then there is the undeniable charm of Mandy Miller as a little girl who steals her few moments from the camera just from everyone else. <br /> <br /> But most of the scenes are played so straight that one could not think of the director Alexander Mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy in the past (his previous comedy Ealing "Whiskey Galore" does not ruin this impression, Alas). Roger MacDougall's work postulates the notion of scientific progress as a potential disaster, but fails to present Sidney's unpleasantness in something other than the most pleasantly pleasing lights. <br /> <br /> Ealing's plays are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy. Yet the Ealings I've seen never seem to do that, working only when they play aggressively against our own likes. "Kind Hearts And Coronets" and "The Ladykillers" (Mackendrick again, understand) are classic in this way. "White dress", on the other hand, is a useless walk that falls apart when it should coexist, just like that unlucky suit.
