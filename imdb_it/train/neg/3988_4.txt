In short: <br /> <br /> Spike Lee clearly has a lot in mind. He is thinking of racism, color, media and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, hetero-sexism, drug war politics, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> That level of consciousness is really great. I think it is a blessing that more and more people are choosing to critically examine fundamental aspects of our daily life; the silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. However, just because Lee is making controversial films it doesn't make him a good filmmaker. <br /> <br /> What emerges in "Jungle Fever" is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> first, Lee is simply trying too much. He seems to be desperately trying to accommodate any political / social affirmation he can think of in the 90 minutes. And as such, the end result seems confused and irresolute because it does not allow time to develop characters that can fully embody the ideas that it hopes to present. And thus exhausts the stereotypes and we are left with hasty testimonies and very charged dialogues. The end result is very dramatic and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly, by attempting to make statements about such a wide variety of social functions, it seems to have no concrete or original interpretation of the social / political issues presented. What it encounters is a pool of regurgitated nonsense. You have the feeling that he bought an elementary level sociology textbook and spewed out all 500 pages. <br /> <br /> These are highly problematic features because the film's art is sacrificed and the work is turned into a speaker for the voice of the director's voice. He cannot distance himself from work and let him speak for himself. <br /> <br /> It works neither as a work of art nor as a political topic. <br /> <br /> Although I still appreciate Lee raising these important problems, I have to say: <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down.
