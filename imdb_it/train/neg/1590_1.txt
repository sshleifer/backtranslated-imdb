HAH! So this is the movie where the "Next Action Stars" were added. Well, I'm glad I didn't take part and didn't win ... <br /> <br /> Isn't it funny how you can watch the first 10 seconds (!) On a movie? I mean, come on! Look at those titles! I saw this movie (or part of this "teleplay" since it was produced for TV and we couldn't stand to watch it all) one evening while I was doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge-podge of the average guys who occasionally watch series like Las Vegas just for the girls on the show. so the bar was not very high, the most seen movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and it wasn't for the fantastic script, D. But for the total lack of originality, acting, script and almost the whole movie Otherwise, do a good movie made it easy enough to change channels in Las Vegas (or was it CSI? I don't remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group. And this is rare (!) For God's sake! Not with this movie! If it's on TV, then yes, look at it and think it over ... My conclusion ... well, since Joel Silver produced some of the best action movies (Die Hard, Matrix 1, to name a few) I can only say that producers don't give the film its quality, they give money to directors and sell this film just because it's a Joel Silver film, it's just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew that really made it.
