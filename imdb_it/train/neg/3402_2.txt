That's why the Jane Show won't work. Once again Canadian bonehead producers and writers cannot create a sitcom without putting up something different. I guess these people don't look at a lot of T.V. from the United States that has the sitcom model in hand. No, we have to do something different here, we have to make A's story absolutely absurd and then have a significant B story to try to fix it. The characters are two-dimensional and the plots are really exaggerated: forklift races ??? give me a crazy break. Here's a little piece of advice for show writers, don't write funny situations, find fun in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things, not just being an improvised monkey.
