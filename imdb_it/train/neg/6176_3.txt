I'm not a big fan of the Stooges slapstick, but I find their story interesting. I recently tried to take a look at every Stooge era, but the opportunity to see Joe's shorts doesn't seem easy; this is the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some people say that the quality problems with Joe's shorts are not really Joe's fault, and I suspect it is. Joe as an artist is far from the worst thing about this. The thing that annoys me the most was underlined in another comment: the corruption of the other boys against the third one violates the whole comedy of the team / Stooges. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by the managers as not very appropriate - even if there were no real conflicts outside the camera between him and the others - and this was their way of circumventing it. <br /> <br /> And the titles of this and some of the other Stooges shorts late? Definitely a lack of creativity going on there; was this kind of thing that the cause or effect of the short film market was drying up?
