Initially I became interested in this film after reading a review that said this film reminded the reviewer of Silent Hill. Being a big fan of Silent Hill, and disappointed by his film debut, I thought I'd give it a chance. Mind, Fearnet lists this film only as "Dark Floors", not with its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordi" in the credits I immediately thought of the band (I had some friends in college that I liked) but I didn't think it was important and I quickly put the thought aside. <Br /> <br /> The film starts strong. Despite the fact that "the creepy little girl" was made for DEATH, the good use of sound and the sense of isolation really started to put the story together. The atmosphere of tension developed rapidly and every indication indicated that the film was excellent. Since the monsters are the real horror stars, I couldn't wait to see what was hiding in the halls of the hospital where the main characters found themselves trapped in ... And then the first monster showed up, and I got found very subdued. As the second appeared, I observed that it looked like it had just come from a Megadeth concert, and stupidity completely ruled me out. <br /> <br /> During the film the atmosphere remained intact, and the story left you wondering what was going on, but the fears were practically non-existent. However, I resisted the hope that the end would make everything useful. Unfortunately it was not so. When the film reached its peak, I was incredulous and immediately recognized the big ugly in his final revelation ... Lordi's lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was that what it all came down to? A group of poor souls chased to a hospital by members of the Lordi gang? Suddenly the monster's ingenious design made sense. If you're going to be so trivial, you can also through the members of Marilyn Manson, or even KISS in there. Not to mention I'm pretty sure I've seen the end of one of Lordi's music videos a few years ago. Did they have to go and make a whole movie? <br /> <br /> Worse, when I found out what was going on, all I could do was a yawn. I'm not going to "ruin" it for you, but I can safely say that it's probably a plot device you've seen before. Most likely more than once. <br /> <br /> So, unless you're a big Lordi fan, stay away from this. It's not scary, it brings nothing new to the table (although it does a decent job of borrowing from other horror films, mainly Silent Hill). And, I can't stress it enough, LORDI is the antagonist. GROSS. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Really, you'd be better off trying to scare you by watching Slipknot's music videos. In other words, it is not possible.
