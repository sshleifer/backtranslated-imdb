Actually I didn't disdain the Geico ads the first 50 of so many times that I saw them and I found them also a bit ironic and funny, BUT SERIOUSLY! Is this the BEST thing that these people could invent?!? This show sucks! It's insipid and it feels like watching an episode of "The Office" with characters disguised as cavemen (I know many of you will hate me for saying it but "The Office" doesn't do it for me). Ok, I understand: we have the poor misfortune that only tries to keep our nose clean and has a lousy head who hates it; the pseudo-intellectual who actually has only a barely functioning intellect; and the stupid one who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT !!! I worked with these people and I found them just as annoying in real life that I do on TV ... why should I waste another 1/336 of the week looking at others of those named?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they let you fall into your head if after thinking about it, you'll still fool yourself that this is entertainment.
