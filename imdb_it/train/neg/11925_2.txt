This is a very strange film ... I wasn't really sure what it was, some N lowlifes find a dumb kid in the woods that everyone believes is a kind of oracle and somehow makes them all, in their own way, change something their lives that usually ends in disaster. The film ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me rather unsatisfied, almost bothered by the futility of it all. I didn't care about any of the characters - none of them has the chance to become attached to the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? I'm weak? It was just too weird. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio shoot the child? ... which makes absolutely no sense, useless. Can anyone help me understand this mess of a movie?
