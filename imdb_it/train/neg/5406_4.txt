My first opinions on this film were obviously very bad. I was expecting horrible acting, disgusting, bad entertainment, ridiculous film with special effects. What I got wasn't so bad. The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the film itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent. The acting wasn't so bad, and overall I enjoyed watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad film, but it's not entirely useless as I thought it would be, and I'm glad to know that this film managed to amaze me, even when it wasn't good. Overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but for me it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
