when you get to the scenes that involve Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to gag a hairball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I saw more, if not all of his films, but it was the first time I saw this movie. Modern Romance is an interesting interpretation of the theme of love. There are few films that manage the desperation of love or even openly like Modern Romance, even though the 1979 Chilly Scenes of Winter are very close. Both are essentially concerned with obsessed men who are too psychologically attracted / obsessed by their women. <br /> <br /> Where-as Chilly Scenes of Winter borders the topic of stalking, this film has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship ... and out of the report .. and come back again. <br /> <br /> And since it is a film released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of style and so on. This is the main reason why I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is "If it sucks it could at least have some historical significance," you know time capsule things. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the horrible scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt. <br /> <br /> Man is hair. Very hair Like wearing a curly, furry black fur sweater. And what is worse is that it almost seems to burn the hairy victim. It is not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on forever. In the early 1980s hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009 the sight of something similar is simply disgusting. Sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone said "hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple shirt, I mean you could scare people." It's really bad and I'm sorry for the poor beautiful actress who had to deal with Albert Brooks' naked body on top of his. He was probably pulling his hair out of his teeth for days afterwards. <br /> <br /> However, it's an OK movie. It would have been better if I hadn't seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 continuous long minutes, because that would have forever tainted my vision of this movie.
