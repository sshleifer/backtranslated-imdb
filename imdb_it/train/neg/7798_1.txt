This review is based on the dubbed Shock-o-Rama video, published on an undeserving world in 2002. How serious is it? It's terrible, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It's nice to imagine that an original German-language press can make things better - dubbing in English is not funny at all - but honestly, this is one of the worst amateur films of any genre that you'll probably see. The zombies in the film are slow and awkward as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond their next meal. However, they are also smart enough to handle chainsaws and mischievous enough to know that Western taboo on the genitals will no doubt animate their conversation at the table. George Romero's Land of the Dead placed a zombie nation that kept a bit of social coherence; here, the zombies are nothing but an empty canvas for the perverse imaginations of the director Andreas Schnaas. Absolutely without redeeming the social value, and even worse, completely without entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke to those who waste money on it.
