Apparently, the people who wrote the back of the box didn't bother to look at this so-called "movie". They described "blinded choreographed intrigues and violence". I have not seen "intrigue". Instead, I saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in an alleged kung fu movie. I have not seen "violence". At least, I saw nothing that could make me suspend disbelief about what could hurt a man with "impervious" skin - but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the "plot". Furthermore, as a spectator of many different films (some of which include the occasional kung fu film), I can authoritatively say that this celluloid piece is unwatchable. Whatever you choose to do, I will always remain <br /> <br /> Correct, <br /> <br /> Jonathan Tanner <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> P.S. I was not blinded by the choreography.
