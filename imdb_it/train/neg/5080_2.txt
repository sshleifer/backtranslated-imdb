This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a film from the late 1980s that talks about a silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Wizard Wizard is that guy who attacked 100 straws together and drank something as a child. <br /> <br /> Now that we've got all of this out of the way, let me say this: there's really no reason to see this movie. It is simply a 100-minute Nintendo spot designed to capitalize on Powerglove, Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the loosest sense possible, because it seems that this film was written during a crack weekend team of people who had never played Nintendo, and directed by a man with less sense of my grandmother's style. Perhaps if the screenwriter and director actually sat and played some games, they would realize that they were filming the total garbage and instead go to the professional school to learn how to install car stereos. <br /> <br /> I hope this was an enlightening experience for you. It certainly wasn't for me. In fact, I think I might have lost some brains in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. The next time you're at the video store and you'll see The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting on the shelf in a small row, you miss them all and play Duck Hunt.
