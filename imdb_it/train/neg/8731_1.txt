is the lowest possible score a star? it's a shame. really, I'm going to lobby on IMDb for the "zero star" option. to give this film even a single star is giving way too much. Am I the only one to notice the microphones hanging on the hopper head at the station? and acting, or should I say its lack? apparently talent was not a factor when the casting director came to town. My junior sister's elementary school talent show offers a wider range and depth of emotion. and those fake Irish accents were like nails on a blackboard. the only thing that could have made this film worse would have been ... oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can get.
