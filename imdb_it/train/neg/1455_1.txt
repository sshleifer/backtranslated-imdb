I have rarely been subjected to such nonsense in a film that should be based on a historical figure. A horrible movie joke, I made her shudder. Terrible, banal, distorted and riddled with lies and half-truths. <br /> <br /> Hitler's famous biographer Ian Kershaw was initially a consultant for this film. However, he found the script so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and he even asked to stop using his name as a source (he was embarrassed to think that people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> A scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loved animals over people. He introduced the most stringent animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film transforms its conquest of the Iron Cross into a farce, involving corruption. Deep lies. He was rewarded for repeated acts of courage over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical records showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> In addition to these, Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage game. <br /> <br /> If it were even half ignorant, demented and fat as this film without sense as in real life you wouldn't even know it ever existed. Never mind becoming the leader of Germany. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this film was absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> Go look at Downfall and let it be very wide.
