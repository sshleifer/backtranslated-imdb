"Sir" John Gielgud must have become senile to act in a mess of a film like this. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films, I suppose, that is considered "art", but don 'be deceived ..... it's rubbish. Stick to the art that can be admired in a frame because the films labeled as such are usually false unintelligible like this. <br /> <br /> In this masterpiece, Giegud recites "The Tempest" by Shakespeare while the video camera away for naked people. one of them a child urinating in a pool. Wow, this is intoxicating stuff and real "art", isn't it? This is just an example. Most of the story makes no sense, it is impossible to follow and, therefore, it is something that liberal critics are afraid to say that they have not "understood" and therefore gave it good marks to save their phony ego. Do you want Shakespeare? Read his books.
