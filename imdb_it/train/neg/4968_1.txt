I was expecting the film based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the monster's point of view. <br /> <br /> Whatever you may think of Gardner's book, a film based on the epic Beowulf should not be titled Grendel, when he says no more about the monster than the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing but a modified Predator. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, writers should be punished for ruining the original story so badly and contributing to the growing ignorance of mass audiences in the United States. <br /> <br /> Typical of Hollywood to get this so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a complete waste of time.
