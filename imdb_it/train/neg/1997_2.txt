This version is probably available in your local dollar store on DVD. The print is not great, nor is the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 minutes to spare, you'll get the value of your money (which is not saying much). Anna Neagle is extremely silly like Nanette. Whatever its charm in the past, they are not evident in this film. A large number of beautiful personalities appear in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material falls considerably below their talent. However, it is interesting to see how such accomplished artists make the most of weak writing. The musical numbers (there are really only two) are pretty horrible. Clearly the studio didn't feel compelled to cash in on the rich musicality of the original "No, No, Nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can be had for $ 1.00. It is worth so much to say that you saw it.
