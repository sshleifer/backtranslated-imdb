Should this movie be renamed, it should be "The Jackasses of Hazzard". In summary, this film is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature punk countries that join the famous 1968 Dodge Charger around the city and in the countryside, chasing the girls and escaping the law. <br /> <br /> I've been a "Dukes" fan and what the film is tarnishing is that the characters are out of the key. The excessive indulgence of profanity, sexual references and drug use has transformed the "Duke's" good name into the garbage of trailers. <br /> <br /> From the comparison with the TV show, the acting was horrible. The only actor who understood correctly was the famous Dodge charger from 1969, General Lee. The others have exaggerated the role of the character who has blurred the film. <br /> <br /> The "Dukes" were another victim of the tragedy of the 21st century transition between Hollywood and television. Skip this movie and buy TV series on DVD. <br /> <br /> My vote: F
