Surely one of Eddie Murphy's funny films is nonsense about a kidnapped mystic child, three hundred dragons and a "Chosen One". <br /> <br /> Murphy is the "Chosen One" in question, and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". Missing and missing child seeker, he is approached by a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis) who tells him she is "The Chosen", and that it is her destiny to find and save "The golden child". Because if the child died, compassion would die with him, because he is the bearer of compassion. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus pocus junk didn't spoil it for you now, surely it will be once the movie starts Suffice to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the whole movie. Thought to be another vehicle for Murphy's selfish brand of humor (the comedy isn't that big for you), the film fails on many levels. Even Charles Dance, like the evil Sardinian Numspa, cannot do much for the proceedings. Very silly and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, 12 December 1993 - T.V.
