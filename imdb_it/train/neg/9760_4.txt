The shooting crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so the shooting of the Israeli side dominated. I was struck by the almost completely opposite views of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the chance of a life of enormous happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the chance of a life of deprivation and despair. With these completely different points of view, each meeting had no chance of meeting minds. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace for the Palestinians was freedom. Peace for the Israeli was security. With such an abyss, is this type of film really worth much? I ended up feeling like I had seen unnecessary propaganda - both sides were not convincing.
