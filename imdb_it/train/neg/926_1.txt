This film is about Tyrant, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to call Tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrant, we learn after about an hour, it's also called Demonicus. This adds a lot of depth to the script and challenges our hypotheses on identity, psychology and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Tyrannus completes its small list of things to do (kill some people and utter repetitive sentences in Latin) possessing the body of a college boy. Use a magic helmet to control the mind, to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then in different parts of the film, takes off and puts it back. <br /> <br /> Maria has oral sex on poor Sean Willian Scott, and Tyrannus is wearing the Rollerball glove. Tyrannus has its green backlight for no reason, and is apparently sitting by the CG fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. Absolute misfortune. <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hurt you. Watch it.
