This is not a good movie. It's bumpy, all the acting is bad, and it has a lame story that you've seen a thousand times better done elsewhere. Not to mention all the points of the plot that come from a mile away. Worse still, no one has bothered to tell Lonette Mckee that she can't sing. But who cares, it's really so beautiful. But I digress, nothing new here. Bottom-line, the hot girl group takes advantage of it, someone gets caught by drugs, someone gets teased by a guy, someone leaves and then something horrible happens. Surprise surprise. Welcome to the world of music. I can't believe that so many people out there think this is a good movie. Many of you seem to want to use an escalator when it comes to classifying Black Movies. I don't play it! If you want to support these films by going to see them - fantastic! If you liked it - super! To each his own. But don't try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I wish colorful people weren't spying on this kind of film just because they have black actors. Want to see a nice African American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the purple color. They would be great films, no matter what the skin color of the actors. Why? Because they told compelling stories with great acting, which made you feel something after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience doesn't make it a good movie automatically. It's just good - when it's good. Period.
