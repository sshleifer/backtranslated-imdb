I don't know where to start, so I'll start with a snippet on the back cover of this movie. "Alive combines the tension of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Kitamura's Versus." I haven't seen Versus, so I can't comment, but I think Cube was an excellent film that I recommend to everyone. However, in this case someone has clearly confused "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I will go ahead and ruin the entire plot, because besides being a Swiss cheese of a plot, it is also moldy cheese, and the film is not worth spending any time even if you don't know the plot in advance, so it doesn't matter. If I misunderstood the plot, don't hit me - it's probably because I struggled to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the US military in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. This seems to make sense because they are both deserted, so I'm definitely in the same place. Different continents or not A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired something alien that was transmitted to a Japanese researcher who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. Everything. The alien thing is now being passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the current guest. The Japanese army wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to pass it from the current host (the researcher's daughter) to another guy. But instead of choosing someone outside the army, who is full of bloodthirsty people and already on the military's side, they decide that it's probably a good idea to pick some criminals from death row. Oh, and the reason they choose this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first in history not to die from the non-lethal electric shock which is the standard method of execution, because everyone dies because of the placebo effect when they get electrocuted. I don't know if they do it so they can chuckle in the staff room about how they all die even if it's not mortal, or if they just want to reduce their electricity bills. <br /> <br /> So the film turns into what should have been the Matrix if he was really lame, and the superfluous fight bores us to tears for what seems like an hour. And oh, wait, now they remember that they already had a guy who had been infected by the alien thing, so the whole movie up until then was actually a waste of time and even human lives. Then everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I didn't want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich, was when a guy was nailed to a wall by a pipe across his chest and is wandering up there and passing a another guy. The guy on the wall says "It hurts me, shoot me". And the living type looks at him, and it's not like he's a bad guy or something, so he looks really sad and doesn't want the boy on the wall to suffer. So shoot him. <br /> <br /> (rhetorical pause). <br /> <br /> in the stomach. "GING THANKS A FREAKIN 'HEAP."
