I've always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this was a total waste of two and a half hours. I expected more on Son of Sam and instead I had a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial murders. The talking dog was ridiculous (you know you're in trouble when all the movie's customers burst into laughter inappropriate). The whole film seemed very uneven and not very interesting. Sex scenes were totally irrelevant to the plot. I'm not against sex in movies, but it should have some points (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort !!
