All these reviewers are correct. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, believe me, and this beats everything! <br /> <br /> This is not just a waste of time "so bad is good", but a real, hilarious, atrocities movie. <br /> <br /> CHECK the white hairy monster thing! <br /> <br /> WET YOURWELF LAUGHING at the acting of "magic of spells" by Thom Christopher! <br /> <br /> GAPE IN SHEER A ** E-CLENCHING AVAILABLE! to worn out sets! <br /> <br /> This is one of those "European co-productions". No wonder we have so many wars. I swear, some of the people who take part in "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" aren't really aware of appearing in a movie! <br /> <br /> FACT! I originally saw this movie about HTV Wales late at night while suffering from concussion and sleep deprivation. I had to find a copy several weeks later to make sure it was really that terrible. IS. Worse than Lee Majors in The Norseman, more laughable than all of John Derek's films, this is, indeed, the Citizen Kane of Trash.
