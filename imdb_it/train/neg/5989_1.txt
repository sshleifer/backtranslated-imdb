wow i paid Â£ 3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. I can't believe I've wasted time. The acting is worthwhile at most and the special effects are coarse. Probarly, the worst story in history, extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear to god "wiped out" is better than this. Madonna should win and Oscar over these guys. An hour and a half of my life I want to come back. Honestly people do not see this, even the child could find this film an insult to their intelligence. I found this film very strange in the fact that it was difficult to say who was more of wood, here guys real puppets. glad that kids don't waste time in this movie that you will live to regret it.
