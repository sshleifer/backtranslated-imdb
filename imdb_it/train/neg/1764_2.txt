Although in many ways I agree with the other comments of the reviewers. I find the plot and the idea to be very good. Many of the secondary actors were very good. The fatal problem of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I'm sure, I've never seen a less talented "actor". How come this person has ever been in a movie or on television, I can't imagine. In my opinion it would be better than a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles, please ask ...... "Who knows"? I would love to see this film redone with some talent. I did not criticize the writer for the failure of this film that is worth the time to see it.
