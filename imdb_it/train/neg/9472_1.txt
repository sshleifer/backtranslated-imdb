There's no way to avoid a confrontation between The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, so let's take that part of the middle. First of all, let me start by saying that I think Grinch was an undervalued and unpopular film. Cat was ... well, just awful. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey has been chosen because he is a brilliant physical comedian and is fearlessly committed to outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old bag of sockets. <br /> <br /> Why, why, why Mike Myers ?? Kids could care less, and the Austin Powers demographic has no intention of spying on this movie. So what was the studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The cat was also apparently linked to Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why a New York accent? Not entirely consistent with anything Dr. Seuss has ever written. Myers was even allowed to sneak into his Scottish shtick. I wonder how many different voices the director and studio tried to modify before they gave up and said "until you say fahklempt", you can keep accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any kind of comfort, either in costume, make-up, or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Jokes, those few were, were rough and inappropriate. When Myers takes a garden hoe and handing it to the camera: "I got dirty", everything was missing, except the blow of the circle, and even that wouldn't have helped. <br /> <br /> The same people who created "Whoville" ', clearly had a hand in the creation of the city and the houses in 'Cat'. The sets and props were very attractive, giving the viewer a much needed distraction from bad writing, direction and Myers. <br /> <br /> Ci it was a bit of fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston Dakota Fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware of being in a film based on a Dr. Seuss classic, and remained true to the genre. <br /> <br /> Call SPCA. This cat should be castrated and will never be able to reproduce no favor, no sequel.
