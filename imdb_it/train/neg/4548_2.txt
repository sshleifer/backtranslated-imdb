Boring. Minimal plot No character development. I went to this film with great expectations from the book. It could have been a fantastic movie. It may have become a cult classic. No, it was a huge disappointment. It was poorly expressed and had horrible special effects. Was it difficult to determine who the bad guys were: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I'm still puzzled by some mini-plots of the film. I was stunned by certain aspects of this so-called "prophecy", which is never explained COMPLETELY. It felt like I was watching an episode of a science fiction channel miniseries. It seemed very similar to a movie made for TV. Don't go see this movie. It's a waste of time and money.
