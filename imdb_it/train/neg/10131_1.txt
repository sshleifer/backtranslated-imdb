Well, I can ask the question once and for all: "What is the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury, played and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure, there are a lot of notoriously bad movies, but this takes the cake as it takes it so seriously. <br /> <br /> It is a film produced in Romania that talks about how far Romania should go to catch up with Bollywood. He also talks about how completely devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal is. This film is so ugly that you literally feel violated after seeing it and need to curl up in the shower corner and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was released only in video (I can't imagine why) and I suspect that workers who had to make DVDs should wear protective clothing and receive regular advice.
