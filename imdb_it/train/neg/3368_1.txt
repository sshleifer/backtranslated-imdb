For movie buffs who have never heard of the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson) and have never seen the 1963 production of Robert Wise with Julie Harris, this remake will look really damn bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us who have, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (what was Neeson thinking?), stupid computer improvements, and a further departure from Jackson's story, this remake. > <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the original movie. Still frightens effectively without Hokey special effects. Acting is professional and credible. <br /> <br /> For readers of the book, 1963 follows much more closely.
