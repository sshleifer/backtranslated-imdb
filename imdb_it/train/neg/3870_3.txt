Under the dense green glop of computer graphics, Ichikawa Somegoro's art and stunning ability shone. Alas: he is lost in all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo - with the courtesan, adrift on Sumida, rehearsals and acting in the Nakamura-za - were all exciting and engaging, bringing you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any absurd high rush that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets were much more satisfying than all the absurdities that took into consideration the plot and the performances. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors is alive, and gets lost in the dreck.
