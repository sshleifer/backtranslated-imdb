Anyone who has written the script for this film does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (I don't even live there), and those actors need to find another job. The most terrible hour and a few minutes of my life ... and I just kept looking to see if it would improve, unfortunately not for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there weren't many people behind the film, so they had to slowly raise the credits ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a great "How Not To Make a Movie" guide. Too bad I can't give a 0.
