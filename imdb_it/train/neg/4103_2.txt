This film had an IMDB score of 8.1 so I expected a lot more from it. Start out funny and engaging with an energy that seems spontaneous. But before the film is halfway done, it starts to drag on and everything becomes incredibly predictable. The office characters were delightful in the first third of the film, but we know them a little too well; they become caricatures, not real people. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, told only here with slightly different circumstances. The fact is that I could bear another predictable love story if only dialogue wasn't so stale! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and incredible motivations, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office. We hope that this movie will end soon in the Dead Movie Office.
