The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy films. They have always been ready to destroy cities from huge plastic monsters from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they never had the money to be able to produce convincing special effects. This film, released in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. His ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to get the upper hand on humans. It is extremely embarrassing and ridiculous, but also very pleasant. After all, we like these creatures and these movies, after all, don't we?
