A flickering camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to feel car sick just from looking at it. It seemed that someone with cerebral palsy held the camera (no offense aimed at CP sufferers, but I don't think you would expect to work much as a cinematographer!) Camera work was so sickening and so inattentive that my my wife and I considered it unwatchable and surrendered after 10 minutes of torture. I checked a little later (he was on TV) and he didn't improve. I suggest giving this one unless it is necessary to get rid of any ugly sushi that you may have eaten!
