Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips of "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house where she grew up and recently inherited from her dead sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who still lives in it. Jennifer decides to sell her as she desperately needs money for Grandma's displeasure. It also begins to have annoying recurring nightmares of a mysterious crow. There was really no one to relate to in this film. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, not sentimental and narcissistic, while her grandmother seemed spiteful, sad and even narcissistic. The film is good and well done, but without anyone to tune in I found it hard to worry about what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C-
