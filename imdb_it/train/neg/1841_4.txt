This could be seen in many different ways. This movie sucks, it's good or it's simply weird. The third probably explains this film better. He has strange themes and has only a strange plot. So who else but Christopher Walken would have played in this, no matter how badly, on average or even how nice it would be. <br /> <br /> Acting was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always liked it so you know what you're gonna get out of it but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. It's always nice to watch, no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy is pretty funny. This obviously means that it has its moments (even if very few) but it can be a bit exaggerated here and there which makes me feel like the film was only desperate for laughter, but obviously not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> The direction was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and actually he didn't do a good job here. This film seemed to have a lot more potential and didn't do much to achieve it. Simply mediocre and there doesn't seem to have been much effort to make this film. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good play. Obviously this means that the writing here has failed. At best it is below average. Considering that he has his moments it wasn't too horrible. It's never a good thing to say about a movie though. <br /> <br /> If it were not for Christopher Walken and this stupid ridiculous ending I would have given a lower rating. He is always a character in his films. Stil this is just a weird crazy movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. Not entirely horrible, but I wouldn't really recommend it because it's a really forgettable movie.
