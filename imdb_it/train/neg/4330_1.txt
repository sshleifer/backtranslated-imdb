Last night I decided to watch the prequel or I have to say the so-called Carlito's Way prequel - "Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)" which went directly to the DVD ... no wonder ..... is completely ... and I mean completely S% & KS !!! life looking at it and I think it would be a pure time to write about it ... I don't understand how De Palma has agreed to produce this sh # t-fest of a movie .... except for only one fact that I points the hat to ... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante .... reminded me of how De Niro put himself in Brando's shoes to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but the difference De Niro was fantastic and even got an Oscar !!! Jay Hernandez has the courage to try to be a young Pacino ... it's a pity for him I don't think he will play anymore in the film and anyway after watching this movie # $% ty, I sat down and looked at the original Carlitos way to take the bad taste out of my mouth.
