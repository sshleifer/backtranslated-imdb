This film failed to explore the humanity of animals that left me feeling empty. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to give up the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. While Babe (the original) contrasted with the tendency of great successes, focusing on the human virtues of animals compared to their similar humans, all the animals in this film were nothing more than comic caricatures that they would gladly fill in the flesh-grinder (again more if you could understand their useless babbling). Without Eddie Murphy's senseless behavior, this film would be a flop.
