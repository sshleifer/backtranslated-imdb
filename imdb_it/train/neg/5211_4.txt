Has. no doubt Tommy is the villain here. I don't know why, but for some reason, young children in horror movies tend to come and chat. and since they are children, they will not die. because they are annoying ... well ... except for terror. but those are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Anyway on the movie. Can't find this movie on DVD? of course you can! all you have to do is buy the Chilling classics DVD package! not only get Metamorphosis on DVD for $ 15, but you also get 49 OTHER MOVIES! what a deal! PFF. OK. I've finished advertising for these cheese films. Let's just say that this movie is not worth the 15 dollars alone. <br /> <br /> So we have a chemical scientist. Yes. because all the scientists in the chemical industry look as beautiful as this guy who plays Peter. He is trying to find a serum to stop the deterioration of the body. the college he works in wants to pull the plug on his project, so he looks for it on himself. but because this is a horror movie, it sucks it and starts and an incredibly long transformation sequence that takes almost 3/4 of the movie. <br /> <br /> To fill the film you enter into a relationship with a woman who has a child and she has never been married! scandalous! But of course Tommy is one of the most annoying characters ... no. I bring it back. He is the most irritating character. Much worse than the old cripple who wants to take over Peter's work and gloat over him while he's in the hospital. it's true, even if I was an old cripple, you can always be the bad guy. <br /> <br /> So we see Peter start randomly killing some people in the visions he has until he realizes he is the one doing it and just decides to kill everyone on his way back to normal. However in the end it ends up evolving into a lizard. yes, I know, don't ask for it The ending really doesn't make any sense. And if you hope for any really good payoff, you won't get it. <br /> <br /> This is not a HORRIBLE movie .... it is simply frustrating due to the lack of a good reward. if you already have the 50 movie package and this is the next on your list, you're not looking for a snoozer, but you're not even a great movie. Sit down, relax and eat lots of snacks. Because this film won't make you jump out of your skin at any time. <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis gets 4 heads of plastic lizard out of 10.
