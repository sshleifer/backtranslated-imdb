I am completely baffled by the reason why this film is also liked, not to mention held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are otherwise quite sensitive. <br /> <br /> There is a keyword that describes this film at its center - irritating. <br /> <br /> The most easily explained example of this is the use of the direction - or, more precisely, the abuse - of music. In the first half, a really boring reggae melody is played three times (when it is once too thick). But in the second part, The Mommas And The Papas "California Dreamin" is played at least seven times, usually at maximum volume. Godsakes, if you liked the song or not, you will be completely fed up at the end. Think, some people claim to have seen this movie four or five times. This means that they listened to California Dreamin 28 or 35 times ..... <br /> <br /> All this unnecessary hyper-repetition (does not contribute to the plot) could be justified if the rest of the film had any merit, or if the story was somehow engaging. <br /> <br /> But it is not. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the reloading of Bridgette Lin and is still playing Asia The Invincible with a raincoat and sunnies. This too has run out quite quickly. <br /> <br /> I am sure that the undeserved reputation of this film will convince many poor wretches to see it. <br /> <br /> I can only warn you - if you've never seen an HK movie before, don't start with this. <br /> <br /> If you feel obligated to watch it, avoid seeing it in a cinema at all costs. Fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here. <br /> <br /> You have been warned!
