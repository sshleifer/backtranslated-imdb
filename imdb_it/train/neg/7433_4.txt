I have to be completely honest in saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, so I can't give a complete opinion on the film until I see it in full. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw), plan to make a fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from the Finisham Maternity Hospital. It is here that the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works, along with staff members Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and nurse Susan Ball ( Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also around, including the pregnant lady Tidey (Joan Sims) and her future nervous husband, Mr. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard as Freddy and EastEnders Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan doesn't work, because all the staff is getting in the way. That's pretty much all I can say about the movie until I see it again in full. All right!
