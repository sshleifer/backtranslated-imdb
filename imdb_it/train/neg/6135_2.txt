America needs the best man possible to win "The Game", so who do they hire? A gymnast (Oh brother!) Played by Kurt Thomas who has the skills to win in a game involving ninja, a crazy village and Richard Norton to whom Kurt Thomas says "to keep his hardware in his pants". (His exact words) I missed this in the cinemas and that's a good reason because I probably would have been expelled because of the laughter I came across at regular intervals. The first thing that occurred to me was the claudication of these ninja if a gymnast could kick her ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 feet 4 and hardly hits one like "The best man for the job" As for the acting talent of Kurt Thomas, well if you can't say something nice ... In all seriousness, even if one it is surprising how much cocaine was used to provide such a stupid idea. Only the decision to launch Tara Reid as a scientist overcomes the stupidity here. For 18 years, however, this title has had the title of the stupidest film I've ever seen. Not to mention that I didn't find it unwatchable, I was laughing so hard that I almost choked to death. Twice. Only in the 80s could a film be made with such a bad idea. Although for the record it is the only film that has ever seen such a skinny hero, he can't even rip a sword wedged from the ground. This is the most beautiful action movie ever made, and also one of the most fun. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
