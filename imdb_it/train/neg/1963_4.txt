this film is similar to Darkness Falls, and The Boogeyman (2005), but it's also much more graphic than both, and it's not as good as either. Even the slow and fairly predictable.it has the nuances of Deliverance and Amityville Horror.plus, we get some new age flavor thrown in the mix and some of these scenes come out as a motivational / inspirational sermon. In reality, this film is a mixture of almost everything. Even if it is bloody, the effects of the trick are not very realistic. in fact they seem rather cheap. Apart from all this, there is a really terrible clich√© dialogue. And I won't say when, but there is a point where a couple of character actions are not authentic or credible, given the circumstances. no one in their right mind what would have acted in this way. Once you watch the movie, you'll understand what I mean. There is also some nudity free for nudity's sake. It wasn't really necessary. The good news is that acting was actually pretty good. better than this film deserves So after carefully evaluating the evidence, I said that this film was acceptable, but not good. My verdict for The Fair Fair: 4/10
