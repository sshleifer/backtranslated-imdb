The headmaster of a high school (Keenan Wynn) with a basketball team at a loss hires a coach who discovers not only that he is a beautiful blonde woman (Cathy Lee Crosby) but a catalyst for their winning new ways. Are you really surprised? Along the way a love story develops between the coach and the star player of the team, Jack (Michael Biehn). The police are never notified. <br /> <br /> Packed together with other Crown International Pictures as a grindhouse film, this film does not offer any services. This can easily be changed into a TV movie of the week. Cathy Lee Crosby is fantastic as coach Randy Rawlings, especially in her skimpy outfits, but I was expecting more than just a titillation from an R rated movie. A secondary storyline involving a crap center hypnotized by her teammates being the former NBA player Sydney Wicks is the real reason for the team's new success rather than Cathy Lee's training. Too much teasing and not enough sleaze makes this a huge disappointment.
