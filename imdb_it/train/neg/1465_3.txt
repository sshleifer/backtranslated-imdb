First I would like to add that I myself am somehow a historian, so what I look for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here though. Certainly the film is fun and everything except that it is not entirely based on real facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for the Jews before the First World War. It was however during the First World War and later formed his views on the Jews. Even his education in this film is inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a small, troubled urchin. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that are added to Hitler's puzzle. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor but does not fit the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as depicted here. Under his younger years he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people through his charm. His unstable behavior and outbursts of anger began at the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not on accusations. I really hate when people point guiltily at Hitler and others for example and tell inaccurate stories just to paint an image of them as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story EXACTLY because this is how everyone can learn how it was! Those behind this film should have done some research before doing so. Because it seems they didn't even know what really happened. Hitler was not even fired in Munch's revolutionary march, his shoulder was torn from his grip. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see it.
