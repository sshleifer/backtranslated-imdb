The film started pretty well. He had a mate hit by a glowing green meteorite, who obtained super powers (telekinesis, X-ray vision, invulnerability, flight, the ability to talk to dogs, superspeed, vision of heat, and the ability to grow large and quickly), and fight crime. From there on, everything is downhill. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man receives a costume from his mother, fights with resident gangs and has many broken encounters with gang leaders who serve to make you disappointing, too long and the end amazing. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so terribly bad if it weren't like watching a boxing match in which the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience is looking forward while the fighters just keep dancing. <br /> <br /> Despite all these absurdities, the film has good points. It clearly indicates that if you try to face a band alone, they will return to your home and hurt you. It states that gangs and communities must see their true enemies (the great leaders who use them for their own purposes to crush honest people in a ghetto existence). He also says that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community to destroy the predators that harm them. The only message that is really missing is that voters should make sure that their elected officials (Rudolph Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush) are not criminals. <br /> <br />
