"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is, in a nutshell, the worst film ever made, much more obscure than even the "Plan 9 from Outer Space". <br /> <br /> The film Lampoon is told in three segments, each of which is presumably a parody of a conventional film genre, but each one lands at our feet with a disgusting thud. There is no rhyme or reason for these execrable cartoons, and no legible plot. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer on this site wrote that the only positive points of the film are the nude scenes. True, Ganzel and Dusenberry lack some meat, and it is also very beautiful. But the directors don't seem to realize that T & A also needs a good story to surround it. There is none of this here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one, with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young and eager beaver cop paired with a cynical vintage vehicle played by Widmark. And just for a moment, those of us who are still observing this hateful cinematic exercise are heartened by the thought that we are going to see a redeeming story about how the young idealistic policeman brings a purifying change in the veteran's approach to the old police work. But no luck. As we have said, this film has no positive values. It's bursting until the final fade - which, perversely, is stretched longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the directors knew they had a bad thing and wanted to do the minimum.
