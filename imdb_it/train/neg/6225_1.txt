I doubt this will ever be a cult film either. I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I didn't expect much from this movie and I had even less. What could have been intelligent and moving was campy. He lacked the music that made Gram and had more food than cheap dog food. There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era. The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a Gram fan and all versions of his "afterlife adventures" that I heard. Rock and roll is full of stories, even good ones, but they should be taken with a pinch of salt. They can be great stories even if they are exaggerated. However, this film has taken a good story and turned into tripe. Stealing any dead body and the resulting consequences should never be a boring story, but somehow it made it boring. I'm tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons, go to the desert and burn them all.
