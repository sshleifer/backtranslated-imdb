I was fascinated by the cartoon when he went to college. He had the charm of "Get Smart". Although he admitted his flaws, it was pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Of course I was very interested in seeing the film version. It was before I saw it. Afterwords I wish it had never been done. <br /> <br /> Besides being uncomfortable in everything (who on Earth if Broderick was also close to the role?) He didn't make the vow. <br /> <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the movie; see a live-action version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and a treatment that made it fun, fascinating or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was an extravagant cartoon with a very carefree attitude. It was fun. The film became turbid and took FAR too seriously. If he had had a serious plot or had gone mad enough to make it look like a "cartoon on the film", it would have been fun. <br /> <br /> Since it exists it does not deserve to be considered part of the "Legacy Gadget".
