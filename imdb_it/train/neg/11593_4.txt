I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series. It was so boring that I didn't remember any of this 20 minutes after the movie was finished, it even forced me to write a review. <br /> <br /> Ok, # 4 was a joke and Freddy was the prankster. # 5 tried to get back to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4, which is a good thing in practice. They tried to make a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and fear. Because of this Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither funny nor scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). <br /> <br /> The plot (Freddy killing Lisa's friends using the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) has a good foundation but is not enough for 90 minutes of film. Sometimes the plot becomes very confusing (maybe because there isn't any) and you can't stop wondering what the directors were aiming for. The script must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and so the film was very vulgar (let me say that I don't like cheese, even if I come from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were good like for example in part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about renting / buying this film except for completeness, it's a pretty mess. <br /> <br /> My vote: 4/10 (get used, # 6 is also messy ...)
