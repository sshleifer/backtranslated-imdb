The idea of ​​the story is excellent. Unfortunately, the execution disappoints him. <br /> <br /> The film lacks rhythm, first of all. It should be an exciting ride, but it's slow and more boring. <br /> <br /> I think the problem is mainly in the script and in the modification. There are not enough obstacles and reversals to increase the suspense, and there are scenes that do not move the story very effectively. <br /> <br /> The producers should have seen it in the script and insisted on great rewriting. Unfortunately, when the producer is also the screenwriter and the director, this obviously won't happen. <br /> <br /> Much of the acting seems pretty flat, and that depends on the director - all the actors have been quite competent in other projects. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because with better writing, editing and directing, this could have been a good thriller.
