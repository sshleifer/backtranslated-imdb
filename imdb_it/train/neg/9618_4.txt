I must say that although this film was formidable throughout the story with a plot stolen from films like Friday 13th I Know What You Did Last Summer, this film was not so bad. In fact, it wasn't as bad as most horror movies that Hollywood recently released. The killings, even if sometimes a little too fanciful, were in most cases just that, original. The cast was mediocre, which can be expected from low budget features, but much better than what the Artisan / Lions Gate studio offered. My only complaint that was not due to the film's budget, which was supposed to be small, was the final "twist" invented. I'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me. The ending was simply stupid and attacked. Before I was a little bored, but actually I enjoyed it. 4/10
