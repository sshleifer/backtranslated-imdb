First, I liked that movie. It seemed like a good play with some stupid moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best !!! Same as the wonderful set decorator Robert R. Benton - this man had really good taste !!! But the writers have disappointed me a lot. The best ending would be the scene on the scale, but instead, they decided that the father and his daughter should be together. I don't like the ending. His father becomes his daughter's boyfriend and his ex-wife knows about it and finds it right. It would be OK, if the writers said for example that now there is a different soul in the body, but they did not, they deprived it of memories only. The actors were good, they were really fun. Cybill Shepherd was fascinating, Robert Downey Jr. was very funny in the dance scene :))) ... But some of the moments ruin even the impression of good acting. For example, Corinne Jeffries, played by Cybill Shepherd after her husband's death, had been waiting for him for 23 years (it's a long time!), She was sincere with him, she didn't love anyone but him, and when she met him and was just doing love with him, after a scene with his friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal), he easily betrayed the man he wanted for so many years !!! It would be a good film, if not the ending and a little lost human psychology.
