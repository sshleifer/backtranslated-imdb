This movie is so ugly that it's funny. He stars as Scott Backula as a coach, but it is not important, what is important is the big black who plays first base. First of all he must be at least 75 years old, yet he still plays minor league baseball, secondly he starts the film in the outside field despite not being able to walk, let alone running. Coach Backula moves him brilliantly first by citing the fact that when he tries to escape he stays in the same place for too long a period of time. Backula shows a brighter coaching strategy at the end of the film, (SPOILER), tells his star player "downtown" to hit a home run, clearly "downtown" considers it a good move. He hit the home race and won the match for his team, a minor league team that played the twins that were the majors' class in the film. Now, if only Tony Muser, the manager of the Royals, were an equally clever coach of Backula and told his players to simply hit a home run at every joke, the Royals would never finish an inning so as not to miss a game.
