This film is a waste of film material. Do you think the map of a military mission plan can be placed on a tripod in a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens? It happened in this film Believe that a DEAF person would actually be enlisted in the active service army in Europe during World War II to serve in a "Negro" unit ... cooking, providing services, burial details, etc. ? It happened in this film Believe that a black (and presumably intelligent) officer would select the same DEAF K.P. to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the Germans before the allies arrived? Did it happen in this film Would you be surprised that the DEAF soldier did not realize that a German plane was approaching from behind and would feed and kill? It happened in this film. Would you be surprised that a group of American soldiers support in a barn on a farm where the Germans ran into THANK YOU for their emotions at the sight of the German soldiers who were only 50 'away? They did it in this film, and they left every possible entry to the barn that the Germans could totally control without protection. You would believe that, in addition to radio waves and in clear English, the Captain mentioned the rank of the General, if not his name, as the person he was talking to and that the general, in simple English on open waves, said that the dam Should he be protected the next day? Maybe they should have sent an emissary to say which way the American attack would have started to make it a little easier for the Germans. This so-called film should be included in a list of the top 50 worst films. If it were, I'm sure it would be fine. Look at your own risk.
