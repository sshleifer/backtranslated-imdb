The first adored part, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment is a second part "The Satan Pit". The cliffhanger of something that apparently emerged from the pit was - nothing out of the pit. Then the ages passed crawling around the vents to fill the story, the Beast a roaring thing blank of intelligence, so no medical / bad comparison I was anticipating. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit, although the pit was not opened long after the TARDIS fell through the planet's crust. And finally another ready-made solution that existed without a logical reason - I mean, why not immerse the Beast in the Hole as soon as the well opened? Why not immerse him in all those years instead of imprisoning him anyway. Why not? I could go on but I lost interest ...
