If I had known that this film was shot in the maddening and provocative Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. However, I took a drama from seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious racket. <br /> <br /> The last French film I saw was "Romance" and this too was rather sad, but at least the camera was still and it didn't breathe the necks of the time characters. I'm puzzled by the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas - it will spread to America around the same time as the next big leprosy epidemic. (It's called Dogme 95 because it's the average number of times the actors hit the camera's eyes.) <br /> <br />
