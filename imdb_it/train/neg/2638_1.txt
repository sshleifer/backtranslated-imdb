There is good There is bad And then they are The Sentinel, a political barrel thriller that ranks among the worst films I've ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is good, but a film with so much potential has never been so completely slaughtered. Directed with "sharpness" by Clark Johnson, all the actors in this film seem to work on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas seems bored here. I can honestly say that I have NEVER, in all my life, seen another film with so many holes in the plot. The turning point is predictable from the starting point and the motivations of the character are so absolutely ridiculous as to inspire laughter from the public. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a film without saving value.
