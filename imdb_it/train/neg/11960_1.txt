Actually I retired from Asian horror movies some time ago, after getting completely bored of seeing the same story about junk ghosts. However, I recently started exploiting exploit gestures and decided to offer them another chance. My first point of reference was the appreciated "Visitor Q" of director Takashi Miike. I had already seen Audition and, although I didn't like it very much, I consider it one of the best modern Asian horror movies. So, I entered into this with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, I found only boredom. I suppose this film is actually very clever and it came into my head, but what I felt was simply a collection of violent and bad scenes with little or no coherence between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous for me; all that Miike has done here is make a movie; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate for some kind of meaning. My headache lasted about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and he didn't calm down until the film ended; at least twenty-four hours later, or so it would seem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in films and in fact I'm actively searching for the most famous films in circulation; but while this can be violent, it is also useless and boring and I have not gotten even an ounce of joy. Takashi Miike could have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I really hope this is the last time I come into contact with one of his films.
