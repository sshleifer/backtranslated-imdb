This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen, everything is weak and inconsistent. The acting is absurd, the costumes even more cruel and the story is non-existent. The sword and the adventure film of the "poverty line" were intended to capture part of the success of "Beastmaster" and "Conan", but it gave us no reason to follow us. The main character is lukewarm and boring, he can't even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th century. All the action sequences are so, slow and unrealistic, not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music that plays every time they ride a horse. Don't even worry about this shit.
