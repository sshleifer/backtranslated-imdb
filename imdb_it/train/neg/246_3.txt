This is clearly a futuristic adaptation of "Mysterious Island" by Jules Verne. Sound editing is pretty bad. Feel the dialogue on the set and hear the voices recorded in a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot in New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and those reading this comment they will be impressed by the capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the voice of the director giving directions and giving directions to the actress. "Ok, now get up." As for the other characters. There's this guy who talks to his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien speaks in a deep voice. When yawning or grunting while fighting, hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's first job to shout loudly! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. A kind of animation by Karl Zeman in TRIP TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge's music is good. In conclusion, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS an epic of Ray Harryhausen. Did you know that MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a movie at home and was on the budget of a shoe string? A must look for aspiring filmmakers.
