OK, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg next to Danny Glover parodying the famous peasant and his wife. Then you blow up this child in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. It should be a comedy. And I must admit that I laughed once about ten minutes before the finale. This film has the following elements: an abused and abused neighbor, a tedious, racist legal process, talks about lynching, and death and arson. Funny, eh? No, please, if you never listen to anyone's reviews, please do it here. You can't even force yourself to look at this shit. CRAP! I said it, CRAP! Anyone who names us on this should really sue.
