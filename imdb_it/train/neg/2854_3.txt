Dreyfuss plays a mafia boss who has lost his mind but is now "repaired". Lane is his girlfriend who messed with his Number One (Goldblum), which should have something in common with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone could consider a cast of all-star actors (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor can't help this plot, since Dreyfuss shows no being "fixed" and trying to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br />, I didn't know what was going to happen. The first ten minutes were nothing more than guys trying to tell Goldblum what there was in store for him when Dreyfuss came out, but I save you all the trouble: skip this movie. <br /> <br /> The real reason why I chose this film is because lately I've been on a Diane kick Lane and I tried to see all his films, the real disappointment for me was not only the terrible plot, but also the fact that she didn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the film (even though we hear about it throughout the film ) Even being a fan of over half the cast can't help me enjoy this movie. The parts where the suspense had to mount found me laughing at what was happening. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
