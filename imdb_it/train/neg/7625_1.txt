This is your only warning of spoilers. What a sad state of our cinema when an unprofessional stuff like this is considered "worthy of the Oscars". <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is stage theater. Here the viewer is stagnant and power is based on the actor's presentation and, more importantly, on the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he knows the words better than words. The best playwrights know how to create images that the sterile stage cannot show. <br /> <br /> The second level is the film. In this medium, you can use a weaker writer, but the viewer is not sitting at one point all the time. With the film, the context can take on the qualities of visual poetry and meaning as well as strong writing. Furthermore, the film can manipulate everyday elements like sounds and colors in almost surreal ways. <br /> <br /> The final level is literature. In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated on paper and then re-imagined by the reader. Much more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio. <br /> <br /> That's why the adaptations can go up, but never downwards. The novelizations are never better than the basic film (see the ten cents at the local book store), while the film cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and SdA). Films can rarely be turned into games and plays can always be turned into films. <br /> <br /> As for "The Last Show", it fails. It's a film that should stay on stage because the director is too stupid to shoot something right. The characters speak the same and act in the same way, it's pure futility. Add to this an unpleasant soundtrack and you have a totally unwatchable movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this in my school acting class with about 20 other aspiring actors. The instructor talked about how sad the film was. What is sad is how such a stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. If the scenes of helplessness had been in color, the pool party, and the old prostitute would have been considered a great comedy. See what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American secondary education system must begin teaching the film SU rather than trying to teach with the film. Two visually powerful and unexpected films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, not this one. It's the last one, I want to see it. 1 out of 5.
