First of all, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious to take a look at this, his debut role. No discussion about his talent being evident and his performance excellent. I imagine I can also see how professional critics have appreciated the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and this is where this film fails. <br /> <br /> Halfway, I found myself thinking, "How long do we have to look at a bored? shop girl, standing around a deserted gift shop, rearranging the merchandise?" It seemed to go on 'Infinity! <br /> <br /> Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. Not much luck. The film continues is a bland, boring story, with no events until the end. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying this because I'm an action junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic comedies. But I expect to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Add the fact that cinematography and sound quality are comparable to the bad footage of your neighbors. Depression! <br /> <br /> I don't understand how anyone can appreciate this movie. Zero entertainment value. The longest 114 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
