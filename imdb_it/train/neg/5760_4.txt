Well ... I was going to wait for this to come out on video to see it, and I wish I had, actually I captured the scary 2-wire movie the other day, and that made me want more anyway, what I have is was AIRPLANE on CRACK ... I mean, if you like the airplane or any other vehicle from Leslie nielsen, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if you're used to the usual WAYANS COMMEDY, then you'll be disappointed, there was much more Treasures for the eyes in this that will keep the young teenage hormones happy, which is probably why it was a box office success the first week it came out. I enjoyed a scary movie 2 ten times more than this forage, and a part 5 times as much. Strange that the best of 3 is part 2, but then again I always liked Halloween 2 better than the original ... maybe it's just for me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the aliens say goodbye. But this was not worth the 11 dollars I spent to get a matinee of this with my boyfriend. Save money and resume part 2 by cable until it is released on video tape, so rent it, don't buy it.
