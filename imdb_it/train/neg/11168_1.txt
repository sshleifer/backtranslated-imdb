- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie because it was about not WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be fun. It wasn't. It is heartbreaking to watch. Embarrassing. Every comedy occasion is squandered without mercy. <br /> <br /> I admit I don't like Jack Black anyway. After that, I tormented my brain to think of a good role he played. The only thing I can come from was where o.k. it was a necessary obstacle for the character of John Cusack in "High Fidelity". Jack Black is one of those terrible and relentless knock-out guys (like the fat little guy from Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being overbearing idiots isn't the same thing as being funny. <br /> <br /> It's not even slapstick. It's just irritating. It's not even sloppy, it's just stupid. I've heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too, but if this happens I wouldn't venture to look for it on DVD.
