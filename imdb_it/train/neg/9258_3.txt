It is unfortunate that someone has decided to shoot the best horror films of all time in my book. This poor copy steals a lot of material from the first three films even going so far as to copy how people die and what will happen to key characters in the future and in practice tries to cram three films into one and fails. He can't even create a good scary atmosphere for one (except with the strange exception in which the impressive choral music brings back memories of old movies). <br /> <br /> The only thing we can be thankful for is that there was no Omen V.
