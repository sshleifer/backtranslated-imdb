I often comment on the sheer filth of the truly scary films on the market, and sadly the White Noise has only helped to reduce my confidence that the film industry remains capable of such an effort. I was surprised to find myself getting more and more fatigued as the plot ran out and my headache induced by static electricity increased. I found white noise to be absurd beyond our best efforts to suspend disbelief. Even after witnessing Michael Keaton's ordeal, I was not influenced by his disappearance. Until the end credits I diligently waited for something - something - of substance to connect me to the story of the characters, but such relief never came. Of course, there have been occasional moments of heartbeat, but only because loud noises tend to do so to the sleepy spectator. <br /> <br /> While the acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his scholarly role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the extraordinary architecture in both Keaton mansions. Overall, white noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world protected by three evil shadows, which seek to deceive the living in following the dead into their own graves.
