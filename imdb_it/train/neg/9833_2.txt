Falsely accused, guitarists chasing skirt John Wayne (like John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (like Kansas Charlie) change identities to become "Alias ​​Smith and Jones". Mr. Wayne becomes "John Jones". Mr. Chandler should be "Rev. Smith", but Wayne calls him "Dr. Smith". At no time were any of them as funny as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris or Ben Murphy; though, Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than anyone else, in terms of career. The beautiful blonde Mary Kornman (in the role of Anne), who grew up from her days in "Our Gang", is an interesting interest in Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of nice scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of low-budget John Wayne movies from the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.
