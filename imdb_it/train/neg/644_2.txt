We all wondered "why don't they re-make the slasher movies that were just OK instead of redoing those that were already big, that way they can only make it better?" well with Prom Night they reworked the average but trashy 80s movie of Jamie Lee Curtis and made it even WORSE. It's a film of numbers that clearly seeks to attract young teenagers (so no violence, etc.), The knife in this slasher film is sharp. The director spends so much time trying to make the killer rather appealing in some gruesome way The cast that includes Britney Snow (who was superb in Hairspray) tries their hardest but the material doesn't give them anything to do but pout and look scared. Even more annoying is how the scenes of death are managed (we will hear the attack but will not see it). It also seems that the only place where the knife was worked in this film was in the editing suite since the film seems to have been slaughtered (imagining that anything faraway far away ended up on the floor of the editing room to not frighten the children) pour the money from the Americans who send this movie to the number 1 at the box office !!! Slasher movies are great fun, but in the case of Prom Nights I wanted to download the original. I've seen scarier episodes of OC and Dawsons Creek
