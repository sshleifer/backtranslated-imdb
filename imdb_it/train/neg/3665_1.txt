Apparently, this is what happens when a director allows his fourteen-year-old grandson to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he indulges in alcohol in the meantime; as I said before, even though I've always wanted to capture one of Paul Naschy's werewolf photos, this atrocity was my introduction and, as terrible as it is, I'm going to pursue other voices in the series, albeit very gradually. <br /> <br /> Despite some high profile disappointments such as THE HOWLING (1981) by Joe Dante, I love the werewolf images in general but, to be honest, I quickly lost interest in the "plot" of this film and I stood there watching on the TV screen counting its nonsense. There were too many to mention here, but I have to say that two that seemed particularly hilarious to me were the schizophrenic nature of the Werewolf character (that is, to pass from a raging beast in a blow to a stunned state similar to a zombie in the next - how if it was in an informal walk at midnight in the country, and showing off a completely different wardrobe ... and, yes, I knew the reasons in advance), as well as the "Phantom of the Opera" look of the character of Wolfstein! But what do I know - maybe the elusive full version of this mess could very well be a bona fide horror classic!
