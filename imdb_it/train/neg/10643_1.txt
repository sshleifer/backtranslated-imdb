I'm usually a bit of a fan of the eighties and early nineties, when the movie is now on the scene ... but this movie is so incredibly awful that it was a real endurance test to deal with. The boys who dress up as girls have been killed - but never so pathetically. Corey Haim's performance was abysmal as usual, Nicole Eggert wasn't much better. This has no ransom, even if you are a fan of an actor / actress in this piece of trash - stay away!
