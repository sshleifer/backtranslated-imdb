What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it is located in the midst of a jungle of aberrant scripts, mediocre direction and wooden acting of most of the cast. Many of the characters are sadly upset, especially the always overrated Colin Friels. <br /> <br /> Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the "character development" is done through a stupid, distressed voice and often completely contradicts the behavior of the characters on the screen. Indeed, it is difficult to understand who the voice over are because they describe characters so different from those we see on the screen! How do we intend to know that Colin Friels (Javo) is destined to be an irregular, violent and unreliable addict? One of these stupid voice over tells us. To shout loudly, the nature of his character is half the point of the film and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin 'voice over! The real killer is the characters. All about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and seem fresh from the rack, despite the fact that we are constantly reminded that they are meant to be poor indigents. They are all absurdly known for "addicts". No one seems to have any real understanding of life on skates or slaps and yet this is bound to be the case with most of them. Monkey Grip no longer deserves the attention of a TV movie matinee on weekdays. Crude like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a distressing clich√©-driven drama that shoots so much that it is plausible and meandering for hours without really going anywhere. At least Noni gets to her birthday suit at every opportunity. There is no other reasonable reason to put up with this garbage.
