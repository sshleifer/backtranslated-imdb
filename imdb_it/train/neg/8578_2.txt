One of the most silent films of the 1940s, a haunted house-infested comedy with Kay Kyser. Kyer, conductor and radio-star (and eternal college fraternity goof-off), was a sort of precursor of Spike Jones, who took him in hand for his guests and voluntarily supported by his cheerful company of musicians. He is hired for a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind in which the poisoned darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The shindig is assaulted by a creepy judge, a terrifying professor, a threatening swami, a lot of shaggy bitches and jokes ugly enough to fill three photos of Bob Hope. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) have nothing to brag about, and neither is Kyser too confident, with an elbow-like material that dates back to 1940s back ten years. * from ****
