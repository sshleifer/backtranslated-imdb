As a big fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. The set of bright decorations and poorly lit sets steal every style from this remake. The mood is never there. Instead, it looks like so many TV movies from the 1970s. Crenna is not a bad choice like Walter Neff, but his snappy wardrobe and the "swank" apartment do not fit the mood of the original, or make it an interesting character. He does his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is really the wrong choice. The English accent and the California appearance cannot stand comparison with the velvety voice of Barbara Stanwick and her sex appeal. Lee J. Cobb tries to model Barton Keyes to perfection, but even his performance is simply gruff, without style. <br /> <br /> It looks like the TV movie that was and still reminds me of which remarkable film the original still is.
