I thought they should have called this film "Bianchi" instead of "Heights". Godawful ... the kind of movie that makes New Yorkers hate. People who are so obsessed and think their lives are so important ... give me a break. The cast of this white lily that Glenn Close was the most ethnic character in it, this film asked someone real to come in and steal it ... and so they introduce, take this, a character even whiter than the rest of the cast (I thought it was an albino at the beginning) that should be Welsh! I'm still trying to decipher that accent! Intellectually dishonest ... this movie is the kind of movie that can fool so many people into thinking it's worth it because it has the traps of something more ambitious. Better to fill theaters with MI5-10 than with this pretentious fiction ... it must have been a better game because you can't fall off the floor.
