((NB: Spoiler warning, as it is!)) <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a teen slasher flick - the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs spiced up . If you're looking for Roshambo, it's not like that and it wouldn't have been. I am desperately impressed by the stabs to his cinematography, directing or acting. <br /> <br /> Secondly, this was not Zuniga's first horror film, it was her first period of film appearance, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it's worth; nor Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you must also give a slash flick slash. Of course, there follows the formidable message profoundly offensive of its kind: every young person who has or shows an interest in sex is meat at the base, and the time of harvest is now. <br /> <br /> Except that this cuts the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now there is a mediocre film of teenage deaths that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this has been called the only cinematic role of naive. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term, gives the girl too much credit. <br /> <br /> (So again, this film probably has one of the highest percentages of actors in a film in history. Of the nineteen accredited actors, a thirteenth boy never appeared in any other film, three are appeared in another film by the same producers and only one in addition to Zuniga has a good six credits for the script. What was it, the company was and never was mutual? <br /> <br /> Sure, I've seen it a long time does on the cable late at night when I was bored and I never expected to get bored again in my life, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and launch them in the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
