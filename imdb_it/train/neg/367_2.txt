A guy gets into a lot of money and promptly starts living it. Unfortunately, the man whose money really is really bad. He wants his booty back. When he finds out who has the money, he starts trying to get it back. He continues to be foiled by this little boy who is just lucky enough not to fall into the hands of the evil man. He looks familiar, I bet. Very predictable, not at all interesting. Come up with something different, okay guys?
