Summary: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply and loving and some are perfect for each other even if they met only a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother-in-law is not so happy. He fears that marriage is a threat to his quiet work in the family business and decides to organize Ron's graduation party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel up. <br /> <br /> Comments: It should be the sequel to a comedy classic, but it's not funny at all. It is above all a pubertal spectacle and a youthful excuse to show poorly dressed women. In fact, in a sense, it is almost impressive to have many that you can put there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately this is also one of the signs of a film that cannot support itself. It's simply not good enough. <br /> <br /> It has three points but, actually, three actors who deserve a better script than this. Is the main actor Josh Cooke who manages to give an impression of common sense. Sara Foster, I know, has more talent than making movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seems to have a lot more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is suspiciously absent are good jokes. In reality, even bad jokes are scarce. It's just not fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
