This is one of those movies that I could only sit in once. Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, in the dialog box, in the direction, in the editing, in the sets and in the special effects. Sure, it was 1933, but it's really creaky. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there are faces shouted for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The film is just finished without cohesion. Much of the spirit, humor and continuity of Lewis Carrols are lacking. What a pity! It's a fantastic book I'd recommend the 1951 version of Disney.
