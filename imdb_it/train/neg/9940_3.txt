In the '60s, having as a background the proof and recording of "Sympathy for the Devil" in the classic album "Beggar's Banquet" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones ?? Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones ?? plus Marianne Faithful, does Godard reveal other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements ?? Black Power through Black Panthers, feminism, communism, fascism - interwoven with the reading of a low-cost political novel divided into chapters: "The Stones Rolling;" Outside Black Novel ";" Sight and sound ";" All About Eve ";" The Heart of Occident ";" Inside Black Syntax "; and," Under the Stones the Beach ". <br /> <br />" Sympathy for the Devil "is another pretentious and boring mess of the irregular director Jean-Luc Godard. Narrative and movies are horrible, but fortunately I love the Stones and "Sympathy for the Devil" and it's nice to see them early in their career, otherwise this documentary would be unbearable. Vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sympathy for the Devil "
