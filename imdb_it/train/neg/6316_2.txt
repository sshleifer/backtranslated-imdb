A film like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country does not understand it. They never did it. And liberalism continues to slide more and more into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This film is about a small baseball star who decides to stop playing football as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a group of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, will join his cause. Not only are some of them joining the cause. When his movement reaches its peak, entire professional and university sports championships must cancel their seasons from when no one will play anymore. Just to move this review together, I'm ready to give them this premise. Although it will never happen in a million years, I guess it could, so go from there. <br /> <br /> I don't remember well how, but a certain kind of agreement is reached, and the guy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sweet and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before criticizing the message of this film, let me tell you that this film is poorly written, played and directed. Even if you agree with the boy's position, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was built. And this is a shame because there are many good actors that are wasted. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does what he could have had with his character anyway, and I would like him to try acting in other films. Unfortunately, it is much easier to find work in the NBA coaching world. One would like Mr. English to teach more of these cloying NBA types today how to shoot rock a little better. Alex certainly knew how to put the ball in the circle. <br /> <br /> As for the message of the movie in question, it's just wrong. Clear and simple. All those nuclear warheads hidden in those missile silos in the west PREVENTED WAR !!!!! It would be a thing for this boy and his flock to protest against a real war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were never used, and that was the genius of their existence. Neither side during the Cold War was crazy enough to fire a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what could have happened between the United States and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The producers of this film are obviously intended for children in America to take their cause and follow in Chuck's footsteps. However, children in America are smarter than left-wing opponents who created this dreck. <br /> <br /> The film is only worth 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, keep Dr. Strangelove instead. <br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you are not Frank Capra!
