Summary: according to legend, the Valkyrie Brunilda challenged Odin and was chained to a rock surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a pure warrior of heart can go through the flames, free Brunhilda and free her from Odin's request, and have her for herself. Now, the war is raging in the Norse lands, and the king needs an alliance with the Berserkers. The Berserkers are warriors claimed by Odin's troops, eager for war, blood and flesh, and therefore outcasts, but superior in battle. The head of the Berserkers is a despised son of the king, Boar, and his price for the alliance is his brother, the future king, Barek. But after the King is victorious in battle, he refuses to give up his only remaining son, breaking his oath to Boar and betraying him and killing him. The boar is saved only by Barek's call on Odin. But this is only the beginning of the battle between the brothers, and their final battle is about to begin now, a millennium later ... <br /> <br /> Comments: I had hopes that this would be a movie based on some of Viking land, too little Viking quality films were made. It started very well, with detailed longship and armor, beautiful and harmonious scenarios and an OK battle. <br /> <br /> The foundation in the myths of Aesir is subtle and seems very corrupt to me. Odin is much more vindictive, spiteful and absent than you remember from school, and the Valkyries have been turned into vampire demons. I'm not an expert, but it seems absolutely wrong. <br /> <br /> But the fatal mistake made by this film is to shift the setting of time from the historical period to the present. If the two brothers fought at the right time, with some decent battles, this movie would have been much better. Now the setting has suddenly changed to the current Stockholm. Yet, Odin is present and is sending Boar and his berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek who give silly scenes when the berserkers are armed and sworded with Barek among the industries. Beautiful mountains and woods have been mistaken for cement. And when it was allowed to focus on individual fights instead of massive battles like the beginning, I quickly saw that the actors' fights and abilities are slow and awkward. <br /> <br /> The end result is a subtle story, sometimes difficult to follow and sometimes just silly, and the only one who could save it, the action, is taken from slow, boring and awkward swordsmen fights . It draws very little from the myth of Aesir or from the Viking tradition. So both the story and the action fail, and the film is simply ugly. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Swede, this film is a bit confusing. Presumably shot entirely in South Africa, it still contains some Swedish family signs, plaques and what looks like a real police car. However, the effort is scarce and goes so far as to make it really work in Sweden. No name is Swedish (perhaps with Anya as an exception), no familiar scenario is Swedish, they (presumably) speak a little (ancient?) Norwegian, not Swedish. And the uniforms, both police and medical, are clearly not Swedish. If they weren't going to try to do it correctly - and really give the illusion that it's set in Sweden, why bother at all? <br /> <br /> 4/10
