I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Porretta was good-looking but looked like a Mexican porn star, not an English outlaw. costumes? what costumes? a shirt with black leather strips on it. it was Marion's clothes - or lack of them - that really got me. the "fans" of this skunk really believe that women dressed like that in medieval England. the Mongols and the Vikings were inaccurate and stupid, but the episode with an ALIEN was the worst of all. Especially because his makeup consisted mainly of oatmeal on his face - an old trick. The hedgehog monster was rather amusing, as if he were going up the side of a castle on an arrow ladder - as if. American accents grated like the initial drawl on "RAW-bin Hood and LIDDLE John". The second robin and Marion were really looking like looks and what was left of the show went completely down in the plate ...
