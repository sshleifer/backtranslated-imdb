With the MASSIVE advertisement, Nickyodeon and Nick Jr. are going up at that point, my son was bothering us to see it. Among the DVDs and theaters, I've seen pretty much everything from the exceptional (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really ugly (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was undoubtedly the worst film I've ever seen, children or no children. He was a "when will this stupid thing end?" kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at young children (or better - it's offensive to anyone over 3), but I've never seen anything so predictable, repetitive and slow moving. Then once you're tired, but relieved that the film is finished, there's this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the set for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, even if it's hard to say what are they trying to accomplish. The 3-D effects ... yes, if you've never seen a Viewmaster it's a big problem, otherwise not (if you look at the screen without glasses, it looks like it's the same process). Even my son was bored in the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in all respects.
