The topic seems rather dated today. Adapted for TV from the book by Rona Jaffe; we stumble and stumble into a fantastic existence. Four university students are deeply involved in the reproduction of a live version of the Mazes and Dragons board game (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deeply. His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self-inflicted damage. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace complete the quartet of the game. The supporting cast is composed of veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it looks heavy and domesticated. But the highlight of the observation is to see Tom Hanks between his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big success in SPLASH on the big screen. The youngest spectator will get the most fun.
