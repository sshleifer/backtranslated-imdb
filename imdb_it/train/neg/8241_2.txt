This film has many problems associated with it that make it like an economy class project from someone at the film school. I have to give him credit for his campiness though. Many times during the film I found myself laughing hysterically. Sometimes he was so ugly that he was comical, which made him a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a low quality slasher film with a touch of psychological horror and a hint of ridiculous campy, then pop a cup of popcorn, invite some friends and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialogue is almost impossible to follow most of the time and the soundtrack is a bit there.
