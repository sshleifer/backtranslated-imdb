Although I do not claim to be an expert in marine life, I must say that anyone with a minimum of intelligence could never buy this notion of a whale (or even its mother!) Who has a clue about revenge because he saw his dead companion have a forced abortion by humans! I mean, really! This is basically the whole plot. Richard Harris must have been extremely tough for the roles that accepted this stuff. This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you pay 50 cents to see it, you would want to ask for your money back.
