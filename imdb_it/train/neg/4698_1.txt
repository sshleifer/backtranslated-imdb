I mean seriously which group would sing about a crazy car? So, if their ten, it's too immature for a child to sing about "being my women", I mean seriously! Even the name is rather trivial, naked brothers? just because they take off their pants ??? LIKE CREATIVE. I don't understand why they need a television program, I mean that most artists don't really need a television program about themselves, especially the band of naked brothers. Hell, how many of them are in the fucking group. And seriously what is with the film? Jeez Nick was the benchmark of my growing up years, but seriously The bare brother band? SO many parents would not allow their children to watch this in particular by the name of the Naked Brother band, it is a stupid and non-creative show that should not be shown on TV.
