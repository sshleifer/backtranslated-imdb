A group of forest guards and scientists go into the woods in search of fossils. Eventually they stumble upon a Bigfoot cemetery (they didn't notice in the dark), CGI Bigfoot scenes are horrible, but better than the endless scenes of speech that rarely punctuate. I used to think there might be a good Bigfoot movie. But now, after so many sad films about the legend, I'm having serious doubts. To pour the salt into the wound to watch this movie, the good looking UN does not undress once. And while this may be better than "Boggy Creek 2" (not a small feat), it's still sad that the best non-documentary Bigfoot film remains "Harry and Henriksons" <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
