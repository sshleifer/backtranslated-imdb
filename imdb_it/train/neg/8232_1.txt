Five between the eyes is not worth one on the wrist, I must admit that at one point I was really worried, for about 30 seconds no one made a noise and I thought that my speakers were blown or that I had become deaf with the constant screams and loud screaming, I and the speakers are in place now thanks for asking, strangely it was the best piece of the film. <br /> <br /> I won't waste your time telling you the plot, read the other comments for that. <br /> <br /> If you bought this DVD but you have not discarded it yet, do not do it, take it back and request your money, I wasted my not doing the same. <br /> <br /> Actually I was screaming on television "they ended up in the car, looking for the camera lights and getting the camera lens first", I left out the bad words but you can guess where they go. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to buy this movie (it's really good) it's yours for ten pounds.
