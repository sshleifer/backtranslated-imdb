There are some positive things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon doing his best to create something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worthwhile. Since most race films suffer from the fact that car lovers are not that smart, we end up with films like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan who surprised so much in Mean Girls has to make better decisions about what roles to take. Here it can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children will only be moderately amused because they try to attract more adults than children (although they are still rather stupid). Those of the theater with whom I saw him showed no interest after a couple of minutes. And like a family sports movie this is horrible. The best moments are at the beginning in the scrapyard creating a certain feeling and later in the car-bash fest creating a certain tension. If you develop a car as a central character, you have to develop it better than here. After some mandatory race scenes you are in the best part: being able to leave the multiplex in your car.
