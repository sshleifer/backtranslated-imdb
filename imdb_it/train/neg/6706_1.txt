I saw this move several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most of the people here are blasting this movie because the film seems to have struggled together (according to the director's own admission on the official website - the short was shown as a "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But still, it was an easy-going comedy. I think many people try to read too much in a play. All they should do is make you laugh, that's all. I only did it at his presentation, so he succeeded at that level. Only my 2 cents anyway.
