It was made in 2007 and the CG is bad for a film made in 1998. In one part of the film there is a stop motion shot of a dinosaur that looks really nice, but this only makes the work extremely amateurish about things CG. worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, directing and everything else in this film is simply terrible. It's as bad as, if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure shit! Once again, as for the other films, the only frightening part of this film is that it was made and is now broadcast on the science fiction channel. <br /> <br /> I still can't figure out how somehow you make people with acting skills perform in these movies and then somehow manage to behave like everyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> For those of you who are not sure, the other poster is obviously being sarcastic in your review ... or is one of the people who worked on this film.
