It's one of those stereotypical dance movies about the MTV generation, and I don't see where all this "not so bad" junk comes from. The acting is terrible, following exactly the same plot as all the other "dancing" movies out there. It's terrible! The name should scream not look. "How it moves." Since when can film titles ignore grammar? At least some dance films had almost dignified dance scenes, they don't even deserve a watch. I give him a 1 out of 10, just because there is no zero. I seriously plead with anyone with an IQ of over 60 not to look at it and not waste your money. The 1.6 / 10 should say it all. This film should not even be made.
