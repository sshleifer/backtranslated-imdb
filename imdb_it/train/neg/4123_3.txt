Although the beginning suggests All Quiet on the Western front, this stupid and superficial version of the war loses a lot compared to its much better contemporary. This depicts the most entertaining war ever fought, with the first hour and a half dedicated to romance and the good times. <br /> <br /> When we finally see some battle, it's lame: does an enemy plane fly over? Get down (in one go). Tree sniper? Kill him before he shoots. Enemy soldiers in the woods? Don't worry, they willingly give up. Ho-hum. <br /> <br /> Tepid, turgid, predictable ... <br /> <br />
