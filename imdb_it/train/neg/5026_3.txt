Flame, turn off. It seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature that can take it and place it with equal abandon. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but I've been trying to watch all the movies on Mill Creek / Treeline Films' fifty DVD movie series. It's a great value at around twenty-five dollars, so at fifty cents per film, it really comes down to an investment in time to watch some of the silly deals. <br /> <br /> Gammera is irritated by a centuries-long sleep from a nuclear explosion, and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes him to Tokyo, setting the United Nations in motion to try to find a plan to save the planet. They come to the "Plan Z", the hope of the world, and you wouldn't know, there is a scene in which an enormous shed called "the Z-floor building" is shown; that was a nice touch. <br /> <br /> In the mid-1960s, this country was still not entirely politically correct. One of the US military air defense scenes in Alaska has General Arnold asking a sergeant to make coffee. I guess there were no private people around. <br /> <br /> The good old Gammera was rather the show, wandering on two legs and going to the flame throwing routine when challenged. That's why I was surprised by the way Plan Z managed to capture the turtle man in the face of a hidden spaceship, taking him to Mars to save the world. Top five for all the American and Russian rescue team, now back to the Cold War. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, Gammera has generated at least a good dozen films, but seeing this beautiful very satisfies my interest in flying, the flaming turtles. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier has "Attack of the Monsters" with a big appearance by Big G. It took all efforts to get to the end of both films; it was such a relief to get to the last frame in this that said "Gammera, Sayonara!"
