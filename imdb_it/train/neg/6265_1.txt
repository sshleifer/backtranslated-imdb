I happen to be the director's nephew. It took me years to get my hands on a copy of this film and I can confirm that it is indeed one of the worst films of all time. My uncle no longer even has a copy (I asked). I can't wait to bring him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently the average rating of the film is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can tell, this should put it somewhere in the mid-30s in IMDb "bottom 100", however with only 206 votes, not has yet been entered. <br /> <br /> It is sad that the film does not even have respect for a 100 main title. <br /> <br /> However, I am giving copies of the film to family members this year for the holiday gifts. The best / worst gift ever?
