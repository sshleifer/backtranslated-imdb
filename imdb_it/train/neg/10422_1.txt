First, I'm not easily scared of ... Anything but my few phobias, but this film is absolutely horrible. This is not appropriate for children! I had my mouth open for as long as it just shocked me. I couldn't believe how bloody it was for a children's movie, rabbits were brutally murdered! It is not necessary to be so terrifying and to be evaluated G. I recommend having over 8 years to see it. But don't get me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I wasn't scared of a child's fear. I can't believe that a parent can allow a 4-year-old to see it. It is only for intense and complicated, not to forget bloody, for small children. I'm a little over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I don't recommend it
