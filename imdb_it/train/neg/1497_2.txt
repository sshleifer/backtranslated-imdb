I understand that I am reviewing the film I saw. I realize that practically all nudity and blood have been cut from this film, then completely sterilized. When I saw names like Ginger Lynn and Jenna Jameson attacked, I knew I wouldn't have a horror classic, but at least I was expecting free boobies and bloodshed. But no, this must be the most slaughtered modern horror film, I mean, it's easy to say that there is a lot more in certain scenes', but suddenly they cut themselves off, or the scene ends just at the moment it starts. How do you ruin cannibals and pornstars? I mean it's a winning formula, I wonder if the director has slept with a manager's wife or something, because it's literally surprising how much has been cut. Reading Fangoria a few years ago, I was excited, it seemed like a funny movie, but unfortunately the real movie is locked in a vault somewhere, and we have to put up with this piece of excrement called Evil Breed. Hopefully a score without a score will be released one day, because I think a good movie exists in this mess, but until then it is better to take a twelve pack of Bud, because this is the only way to make it through this film.
