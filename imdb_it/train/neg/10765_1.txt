A splendid example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly ruin everything. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Big Sky", writer Dudley Nichols and the company presumably allegedly could improve on a classic pioneering novel by award-winning Pulitzer author AB Guthrie. In this way, they removed the soul of the story and every impact and impact it could have had as a film adaptation. <br /> <br /> The epic nature of Guthrie's book and the evolution of its main character, Boone Caudill, from naive, the boy from Kentucky to a hardened and competent mountain survivor / man, has been replaced by a farce of the river boat that bears little resemblance to the intent of the author. In the film version, Boone's presence is nothing but overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The intriguing and even shocking elements of the plot that give the Guthrie novel the impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason. The most disconcerting of all is the emphasis placed on the character of Zeb Calloway, who was a secondary and secondary character in the book, occupying only a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, the veteran pioneer, completely misses !!! It is also evident that the director Hawks decided that the character of Zeb in the film, played by the actor Hunnicutt, was not irritating enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt has been given a considerable amount of time doing that hateful off-screen narrative that is Hollywood's shortcut to writing, editing and directing an incompetent screen. <br /> <br /> Some films have improved books on which they were based ("Ben-Hur" by William Wyler is an excellent example). But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel, but as a movie to itself. <br /> <br /> The plot is boring and clich√©, and the characters - at least those who have not been modified by the script - are only superficial and boring shadows of Guthrie's literary vision. And unfortunately, the main attraction of Kirk Douglas, which could have helped to lift this film, has been weakened by the open milk role he was given. <br /> <br /> If you believe it, the film version of the Guthrie's Pulitzer sequel, "The Way West", also played by Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further consolidates the role of Howard Hawks as one of the most overrated and toughest directors in the history of cinema.
