This film is lame and not at all funny. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientist who works on the margins of science opens a door to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and his daughter gets sucked through something or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and is wearing a skimpy dress (I guess demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but he's gay so obviously he's more interested in his new girlfriend, and they run into this witch spellbook (they want to be witches or something like that ???) and the evil spell ends up being read again, and that's how the evil demon comes to earth that only the bikini girl and the enraged guy in love can apparently stop. There are topless scenes for no reason and a guy who says my boyfriend is a well-known wrestler but his part is completely useless, obviously they invented something just to put him in because maybe wrestling fans will watch this useless movie. I'm sure even topless girls won't hurt us. The extra features of the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the film, I thought it might help explain what was happening, but in reality it only made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a lot of things (like the other dimension and the book seller) that make it confusing. I didn't like the movie, but it was just a five-dollar deal. I don't recommend watching it even if it's just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the film that was good.
