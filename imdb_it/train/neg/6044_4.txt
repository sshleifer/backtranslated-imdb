A well thought out voice in the serial killer genre that unfortunately gets bogged down in its own pretentiousness to be really satisfying. Willem Dafoe is superb as a New York detective who tries to track down what appears to be a script using the same killing techniques related to Renaissance art used in a series of murders he solved years before. Scott Speedman is Dafoe's younger companion and they have good chemistry (at least for a while). Other characters appear to conveniently tie the two cases together. Clea Duval is the friend of a previous victim and Peter Stormare is a sort of art mediator / mentor for Dafoe ... it's a bit difficult to take, even if Stormare is, of course, never boring. The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. Quickly look at Deborah Harry as Dafoe's less important neighbor.
