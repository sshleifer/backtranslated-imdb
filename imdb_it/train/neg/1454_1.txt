I recently saw this movie twice and I can't understand why the producers made this shitty bunch. I mean, yes, it gives a great impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean the way they reproduced Austria between the end of 1890, the First World War and the interwar period. What I can't understand is why they imagined Hitler as a 100% evil, crazy, unreliable, mentally unstable monster. After all he was a very caring, loving and intelligent man who, of course, had his dark sides, no doubt about it. But why in the name of heaven portray him this way? All its positive aspects have been cut off from the scenario, leaving only a very propagandistic portrait of a man who had the greatest influence on the modern civilization of all time. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating second world war. Yes, he was a racist, and yes, at times he was mentally unstable, especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they cry LIE to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this film was a warning. The real danger of Hitler and the Nazis was the fact that they managed to come to power in times of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost all the living Germans (not to mention the Austrians and many other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was such a "weirdo". If it was as if the producers made us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were delayed. A man like this one would never have approached the party leader, not to mention ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
