A funny concept, but poorly executed. Except for the pretty good makeup effects, there's really not much to do. There are obvious problems; for example, after taking what appears to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the main character seems to go from normal to thin in a few days ... and once he is thin, he remains almost as thin for what seems to be a long time. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film has far worse problems than that - the cinematography is decidedly low TV-show quality and above all the acting is pretty terrible all around Robert John Burke seems to be always looking for a kind of strange imitation of Charlton Heston and it's literally painful to look at ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm giving this film higher than me is that once the film enters its last 1/3 or so and the character of Joe Mantegna takes over, the film develops a fun, captivating "cheesefest abattoir" The gangster's crazy schemes to torment the totally hateful gypsies are a little fun to watch. The finish, if predictable, is also benign. Avoid unless you are a King-Phile or REALLY excited at the idea of ​​Tony Grasso of the Simpsons terrifying a Gypsy camp.
