I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I normally like it, but not in this. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating film in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is hateful. The only remotely funny part is the rocker with black teeth that all girls get. It was so annoying that I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM, UNLESS YOU WANT SOMEONE TO SOMEONE. If you love Adam Sandler a little, don't buy it. It will only make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the shop, hide it to put everyone out of the danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 I paid for it.
