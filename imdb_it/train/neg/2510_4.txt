This TV movie tells the story of the extrovert Frannie who suddenly returns to Silk Hope to visit friends and relatives, but unaware of her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but intends to sell it and leave with her new husband. Frannie firmly opposes the idea and promises to keep the family heirloom so to speak, getting a job and maintaining responsibility. <br /> <br /> Here comes the beautiful Ruben and the two will soon fall in love (like you), and it is from this point that I lost interest .... <br /> <br /> There's more to Farrah Fawcett that only blonde hair and appearance can interpret a character in an extremely convincing way when he puts his mind to it - and it is certainly demonstrated here, as well as some of his previous efforts as Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance since legendary Charlie's Angel. <br /> <br /> Silk Hope is the kind of film that is never denied far from its cheap and cheerful television image, and you know that there was a budget limit, but it is not the worst film ever made. The positive aspects are there; you just have to find them.
