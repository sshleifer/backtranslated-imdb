Plot: The film, which covers 4 odd hours, adequately covers the events that occurred in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and entered deep into Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To learn more about the story, I would suggest readers read the news about Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: if you look for a formula in this film, you can be sure that it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots of bullets and blood. The movie theater where I saw this film was full of boos and cheers when the film shows Indian courage. The cinema audience looked like the audience as in an India vs Pak cricket match. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie as a tribute to the army's sacrifice and the characterization of the heroes of the royal war (4 heroes honored by the PVC) who sacrificed their lives to be able to see this day. The film made a brilliant portrait of the army that fought all the odds in adverse weather conditions. The negatives of the film are that it is too tense and the songs are extremely boring.
