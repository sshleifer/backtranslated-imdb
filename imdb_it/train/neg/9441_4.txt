Has this film been banned in England? why? tom savini, george romero, dario silver, lucio fulci and others had done much worse before and have continued like this ... <br /> <br /> this film has all the basic elements of a decent horror from the 70s or the early 80s film. good-looking girls (who can't act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a crazy brother who runs around the family property, and actually a nice turn at the end . but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned this film, the Italians probably laughed at their collective asses about how backward and cautious the English were. <br /> <br /> there were maybe two minutes of total screen time dedicated to violence and blood (which was greatly subdued). there was nudity but not sex, even if sex allusions were made, of course. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see what could have been done if the directors had a decent budget to work with. as it is, the film is fun, but the lack of image and sound quality removes the final result. <br /> <br /> forbidden ... what a joke ...
