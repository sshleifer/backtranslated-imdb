This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The plot is practically non-existent, the acting (in particular Affleck) is at most poor. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but basically they must agree. As far as I could gather, the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, a shrink who went to a place that reminded him of his childhood and that burned a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. In doing so he ends up paying the family that currently lives at home to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and eventually meets with the daughter of the family .... blah blah blah.
