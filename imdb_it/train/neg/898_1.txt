"Delirious" by Eddie Murphy is completely and totally rude, crude, coarse and playful. This is really the only way to describe this scary piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for the shock value rather than laughs to try to win his sequel. He can be funny every now and then, but mostly he loses the plot with obscene language and unpleasant jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! Unless you like Eddie's bad style. I don't think I'll bother with "Eddie Murphy Raw". I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a film script. <br /> <br /> Saturday 17 January 1998 - Video
