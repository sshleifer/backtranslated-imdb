This is not the worst movie I've seen of Peter Greenaway but it's close. That disgrace goes to the worst book of pillows. The films of this director of 3 I saw that I find them all unhappy. Like The Cook ..., whatever its positive and cinematic aspect, he is completely unredeemed by the revulsion of his material and general presentation.
