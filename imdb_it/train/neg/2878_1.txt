Don't see this movie. Bad acting and stupid blood effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of murders and chicks, but the director relied on video slaughtering animals to shock you, the observer. Disgusting. The murders are rather lame, practically strangulation. A woman who puts worms in her mouth, one puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK chicken coop, "killer" sandwich of the new burger king .... ha ha. I don't think this film is too based on real facts. I mean, the real BTK killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms ... and oh yeah ... even a slaughtered cow's head. Go figure.
