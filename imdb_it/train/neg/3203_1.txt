Joe Don Baker (MITCHELL) is the protagonist of this boring and insignificant action film by deputy Geronimo, a fat fat gassy who sits in a stupid cowboy suit, listening to country music and eating too many donuts. Meanwhile, a vaguely criminal boy named Palermo (played by the guy who owned Fulci's Gates of Hell drill) stumbles across Joe Don's territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly modeled scene. Joe Don - slowly - hunts down Palermo's brother after delivering his legendary catch phrase "It's your move. Do you think you can bring me? Well, go ahead." For some reason Joe Don, a Texan lawyer, has to carry Palermo in Italy ("Mr. Palermo was one of the main sources of embarrassment for the Italian government," says Wilson, another vague character played by Bill McKinney, who was on MASTER NINJA 1, SHE FREAK, and many good Clint films Eastwood). <br /> <br /> Anyhoo, Joe Don's plane must land on the island of Malta, where Palermo flees with the help of a briefcase and a guy who looks like Jon Lovitz. that the film stops. For the rest of the film, Joe Don searches Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, is shouted by the head of the Maltese police force, and is then left with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don continues to look for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a cell of prison, he is shouted by the police chief of Malta, and then he is left with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. Then Joe Don searches for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, is scolded by the head of the Maltese police force, and then he is left with a warning not to look for Palermo anymore. This is an aggravating film. <br /> <br /> At some point Joe Don is thought to have died at sea. All the other characters wonder if he is dead or not, concluding that he is. But then he shows up (he was saved by a poor family) and no one mentions the fact that he disappeared at sea for several days. Even his friendly aide to Julia Louise-Dreyfuss does not welcome him. She, however, offers to help him find Palermo, so Joe Don looks for Palermo, loses Palermo, ends up in a prison cell, is shouted by the head of the Maltese police, and then lets go of the warning not to look for Palermo yet. <br /> <br /> The highlights include, a bizarre carnival with strange colored floats, some sexy strippers, a shooter involving a child dressed as Napoleon AND a tomato cart, a hunting scene involving a boy dressed as Napoleon a monk and any scene without Joe Don. Critical points include Joe Don who threatens a stripper with a coat hanger. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is from Greydon Clark, director of ANGEL'S REVENGE, who appears as the sheriff. Ick! <br /> <br />
