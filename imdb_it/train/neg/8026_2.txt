One wonders how this show is still on the air. There was a couple that stayed together, married and has children, but everyone else broke up. What's the point of continuing this? The show can be fun at the beginning. See all the girls who faint on a man, who almost all like them instantly. It's just like in real life! The girls begin to take sides, tear each other apart and show their true self (or so we think). But that man is left to decide who to choose who he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> What exactly is true love? How can you fall in love with someone when you have to take them? This show is incredible. Did you think online dating was bad, but people have to go on TV to find love? It is not realistic. How can a girl be with a man when she goes out with many others, making out with them? None of these questions has an answer, and finally, when the show ends, you know that there will be no happy ending in the future. As far as we know, everything is scripted.
