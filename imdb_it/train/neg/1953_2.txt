The first episode of this new show was up today and it was horrible. Shaggy not only has a new squeaky voice that has made listening to his torture lines, but it is so far from the original concept and animation style that it is barely recognizable as a "Scooby-Doo" show. <br /> <br /> Even in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew, Scrappy, was there, the team still solved the mysteries. This new show features Shaggy and Scooby fighting a James Bond super villain and his henchmen while they live in a villa. There's not even a van called "The Mystery Machine" (and the teaser for the next episode that promised a robot-machine type transformer did NOT put my mind at ease). How can someone take Scooby Doo and do THIS? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo band, which all speak with the right voices except Shaggy, and even then they are too generous.
