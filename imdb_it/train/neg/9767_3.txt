I think if you're in the genre of the sixties, as I am, you're forced to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely dead train. The saving graces of this strangeness include a social commentary surprisingly suited to the values ​​of the sixties along with a number of relatively well-known actors captured in early (and embarrassing) footage. It is as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full-length film, covering all the salient points (and not only) of the problems between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them a budget of $ 10,000 to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it manages to capture how strange that time, the stupidity, the excess of idealism and the rigidity of the establishment have been. Clearly not for everyone.
