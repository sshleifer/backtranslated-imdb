Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed an all-time horror classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre". Since then everything he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and this is saying a lot. It's about a man (Brad Dourif) who has the ability to set things (and people) on fire ... or something like that. Hardly an original idea (does anyone remember "Firestarter"?) It's a real mess ... literally EVERYTHING is bad! Pathetic act (even Dourif!), Asinine script, poor production values, disgusting special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! A must lose ... it's not even good for laughter.
