To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS. I know it depends on people's personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a few brain cells can definitely see that this is total garbage. So bad does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume that those who say how great friends they are with someone involved in the film and are trying to boost their careers. Poor in all ways, not with people saying otherwise. The plot is a weak remake of the previous entries, the script is the same way. Attempts to hide the lack of originality using a girl instead (WOW!) Do not mask the lack of ideas of filmmakers, and unfortunately there is a complete lack of fear. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, absolutely asshole. I gave this pair of broadcasters a brand simply because they had the courage to convince someone to finance this piece of shit. They must have put more effort into what they did to make the film. Shame.
