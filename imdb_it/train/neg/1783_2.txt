There are no spoilers here ... Because there is no plot to ruin. Madchen Amick is living proof of a face that can play a life - no talent is required. The only bright spot are some excellent one-liners delivered very well by Alice Krige, but then again, it's Alice Krige. His sweet and dreamy voice gives the only hint that these strange creatures can be seductively dangerous. It is credibly terrifying in this otherwise incredible plot. The way they accepted it to accept this project remains a mystery. Screenwriters must have been medicated when they sent this script. He has great problems of continuity, superficial stereotyped characters, writing of horror formulas, and he simply cannot give meaning to what ever it is. Creatures, while having ordered skills like "going dark," the question of where they come from and what they are has never been explored so much. <br /> <br /> Don't waste any more time on this.
