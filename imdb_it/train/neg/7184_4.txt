This was not really a good movie. There have been many implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film ... but I think most reviewers lack the reason why this film should be appreciated by a wide audience. THIS FILM HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't it enough to inspire us to take a look at this movie? A film produced by a former NBA star does not come every day, you know. Stupidly stupid boys in a big house cut by an ax that wields a madman. Every clich√© trotted for us to moan. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! Use of teen drugs! College Hijinx! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
