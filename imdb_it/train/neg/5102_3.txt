Nicole Eggert was named the protagonist of this film, although Michael Dorn and Stacey Keach were much older than her. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a bit of a ride in the movie "Alien lands on Earth". Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry for an alien pursued by the military and takes the fleeing creature in her very sexy disguise. A little nudity and partial nudity, a meaningless sex scene are all characteristic along the way. <br /> <br /> The film stumbles on some obvious beat sets and jokes about shown photos. I really enjoyed the Star Trek joke when Michael Dorn was taken over and had a really cool death scene. <br /> <br /> It was quite obvious that Stacey Keach would be taken over and the film had a weak Finale, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the Alien had passed to Eggert.
