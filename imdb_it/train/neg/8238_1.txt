This film was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen. I couldn't stand the whole thing. I also think that the writer should have some strange fetish for women who pee vomit and shit ... I mean, what was it! I can't believe this was even done and I'm disgusted that I spent a rent of Â£ 4. The picture and sound quality are terrible, the acting ... well, it doesn't exist. It was a poor excuse for a movie and the pee, shit and vomit scenes resembled 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID ALL THE COST! The girls seemed to have been taken on the street and only got the part so they would be willing to take off the tops ... While these girls have beautiful bodies, they certainly did not make up for the fact that their screams were horrible not convincing and a pain for my ears. <br /> <br /> It was like (maybe worse) an amateur school production without a right direction and hey you don't need a set since everything revolves around a car ?! <br /> <br /> Definatelyy not one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I haven't found anything positive to say and I'd like to think that I could save someone else by wasting their money like I did.
