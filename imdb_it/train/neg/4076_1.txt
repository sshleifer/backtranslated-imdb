This topic deserves a much better screenplay and final result than those offered by this film. The script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story, but rather a series of nightmare scenarios freely woven together. The gaps and free ends in the plot are numerous. The scene in which the kidnapping victim is told that her parents are not dead, and that they have been looking for since she was captured, is simply bizarre. It is written as a cathartic moment of therapy with the head of the refuge fugitive who has given her a "missing poster" since she was eight. In the real world, if the leader of a refuge fugitive discovered he had a solved abduction under his roof, what would follow was an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement issue not a 12-minute segment for Oprah. All that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for pure free exploitation. Funny, this is what the film should condemn. In the end he seems to have joined.
