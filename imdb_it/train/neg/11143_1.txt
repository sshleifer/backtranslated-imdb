Hi, I'm a friend of the werewolf movies, and when I saw the Darkwolf title hit the shelves it felt like "hmm, a simple and beautiful name at least ... Althou ... I wonder why I haven't heard of it before. "<br /> <br /> First of all, the movie starts with the tits. A lot of boobs. The boobs are pretty much all the pockets of this movie. Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the mysterious character of Darkwolf (a little spoiler in front of you, but who really cares ...) It's your average biker every day. Not even super-tough, but as the wise old woman in the film says "it's much more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before". Just describing her as a type of tattooed biker. Quite original. I even had the look twice when they used SPECIAL EFFECT "bright red eyes" for the first time! I mean my god, that the "leave-plant-the-points-with-eyes-with-computer" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks ugly here! And don't get me started with the 3D-CGI werewolf. As said before, as a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, how I like the werewolf films, like I said. Pretymuch always build their own werewolf legend. Darkwolf also builds the world of werewolves, on some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It is almost instantaneously after creating the rules of engagement "the darkwolf kills anyone who has touched the girl" starts to cut at random. Which makes no sense, because even bothering to tell us the rules of killing, when they won't even play with them ... Aplus the wolf's point of view shots are made with a Sony handycam or something, mainly filming the floor and walls. Just add snarling noises and you have a super werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf breaks everyone with an open hand, simply placing his hand on the victims, it doesn't really do the trick for me ... <br /> <br /> Really, the WHO gives money to make these piles of junk straight -to-video, I'm not even funny-kind of bad movies, just sad.
