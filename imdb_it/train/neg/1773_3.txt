OMG! Rarely has a horror movie bored me, or made me laugh, just like this. After a lively start with an intriguing premise, it descends not much more than a slasher film, with some supernatural and sexual. The excellent Alice Krige is usually wasted on this, and the twists and turns are ridiculous. Don't worry if you're not really desperate. Rating: 3/10.
