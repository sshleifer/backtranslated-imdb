When you want the dragon to eat every cast member, you know you are in a bad experience. <br /> <br /> I went with very, very low expectations, after reading some of the other comments, and was not disappointed. Unlike other cheap and failed films, however, this really does not remain fun (and unintentionally) funny. <br /> <br /> -SPOILERS FOLLOW- <br /> <br /> First of all, plot is very inconsistent. Looking beyond the "small" errors, like the dragon that grows in 3 hours, the whole idea on which it is based is messed up. See, the movie wants us to believe that dragons came from space in the form of meteorites that were really dragon eggs. After explaining this, they show a farmer poking one with his pitchfork and the dragon sticking out. Later, the obliged "mad scientist" stutters about how the dragons survived the dinosaurs. So apparently the humans were around when there were dinosaurs, or we just have a nice plot hole here. The other important thing is that the laboratory exploded with a "strong half" force than that used for Hiroshima. Then two guys come in to check everything, and it's almost unhurt! There is also another dragon, born of who knows what. All in all it is very predictable. As soon as the guy mentioned cloning, I figured they'd clone a dragon. This means that our security guy Mr. Smarty-pants is not as intuitive and intelligent as the film would have you believe, if you ignore that I knew this movie would concern, you know, dragons. <br /> <br /> Setting aside, the second worst thing is the "special effects". Others mentioned the fake rocks that fell at the beginning, the CG helicopter and the dragon. It looks a little better than a blob, but it ruined everything that was happening when it was dragging along the corridor in the same way from time to time. To their credit, the flying dragons at first seemed to go well from afar (although the one in the cave is probably the worst of the whole movie). However, these things are fun to watch. Scenes showing a million different shots of the same person facing different ways are not. Nor the "introduction" screens with vital statistics. <br /> <br /> Coming to the actors, they weren't the greatest, but I guess at least they tried? They seemed more excited about what they were doing than many of the actors in the recent "BloodRayne", for example, and you have to give them points for that. One thing I noticed was that the woman who plays Meredith often has her face covered in makeup that is much lighter than the rest of her. He seemed to have a bad experience with some white faces. <br /> <br /> The script is ugly and poor. You don't really notice the music, but it's really not bad for the most part. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is not to look at it if you don't want to see it because you feel it's bad (like I did), even if the only fun things are the bad CG effects. In addition to this, don't waste time and money.
