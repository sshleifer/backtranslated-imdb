Despite the great design touches of the future, the astute premise Asimov and the reliable performance of Will Smith, this film is not up to expectations. The clich√©s arrive dense and fast; (waking up from a recurring nightmare, the unconventional policeman has his badge revoked by the tenacious lieutenant, to list others he would ruin it - you see the end of a mile away). This film is also set - you've never heard of having traveled anywhere; what should be a global disaster never leaves a Chicago CGI, of course. The robots themselves are good in the foreground, but the "crowd" scenes look more like Disney's - the CGI is overdone again and again. And if you can destroy the robots by destroying them, why do they need to inject "nanites"? You know it's a difficult movie when such stupid questions start to bother you before the climax. It could have been great, but it is less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the absolutely predictable plot that could come from any action movie of the last forty years.
