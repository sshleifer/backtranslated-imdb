- The film opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unbeknownst to the locals, a dinosaur egg is also found at the bottom of the lake. The meteor warms the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg opens up freeing a dinosaur that tries to terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> - What a total garbage. It's not like I'm interested in the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's the rest of the film that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is absolutely ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comic. The logic is non-existent. Any resemblance between the "scientists" in this film and a real scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on for an eternity on the negative aspects of this film, but you have the idea. I feel it is quite safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
