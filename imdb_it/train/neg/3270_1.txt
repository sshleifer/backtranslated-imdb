It's pleasant and fast. <br /> <br /> On Earth there is no way that the actor who plays Mat can be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit for his hearing that convinced them to hit him. I soon accepted him as a young naive country boy. <br /> <br /> While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interaction between the policemen was natural and well balanced, and worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only 45 minutes long, so the plot isn't complex. The key is the style of the whole thing. It is very shiny and vibrant, and the backgrounds are suggestive, especially since all the colors are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable with the foreign public, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
