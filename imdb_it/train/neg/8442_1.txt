GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands 2005). <br /> <br /> Mousy Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a woman in her thirties, who discovers that her husband (Fedja van Huet) betrays her, but does not dare to face him. He painfully avoids any confrontation with humans, his parents and his sister, so we have a main character in a film that doesn't do much. We barely know anything about his background or motivation. Only a woman who seems to be stuck in a blind alley, not only during this difficult episode of her life. Obviously he suffers from something, but why should we suffer in the public too? <br /> <br /> I almost abandoned the cinema after seeing this unwatchable mess. They were very boring and painful for 90 minutes. I normally try to avoid wasting energy on the bad movie. I'll take the beatings and roll with my fists, but in this case a fair warning is in place. Why did Nanouk Leopold get funding (mostly from public funds) for this turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It could be compensated by an ingenious filmmaker with cinematographic ideas or a cast with a little more appeal. None at all, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is not one interesting shot to find in the whole film. I can't think of a cast that could have flavored this, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this terrible lack of material. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to direct Maria Kraakman: "Maria, look at the horizon, we'll shoot you for three minutes, just express sadness". A perfect cure for insomnia. Grab a copy and watch it late at night, even if it's guaranteed to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
