Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the highlights of 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror movie, but it was also damn good. So, almost a year later, we were treated to the remainder of that remake. While the original writer Wes Craven has returned as a producer and screenwriter, this film fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military practitioners stop in the desert to monitor some scientists and find themselves clashing with the mutant family of the first film (at least those that remain some more new). There's a lot of blood here. What bothers me about this film is the absolute lack of characterization. The viewer doesn't give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we never went into it. Even the mutants have had some characterization last time and this time nothing. Gore for the taste of blood is useless. There must be a reason why this happens because it is interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what's recently in the rape scenes in the movies? Here we get another one without a real reason. We hope this is a collection of hills that will no longer be visited.
