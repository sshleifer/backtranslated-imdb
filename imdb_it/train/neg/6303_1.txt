I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise was interesting. I succeeded, even though I found the acting, except Helena Bonham Carter, insignificant. I kept hoping my time would pay off, but in the end I wondered why they had taken the trouble to do this. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message that is worth transmitting. If this film led to something, it inspired me to read the Orwell classic. I find it hard to believe that his story can be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the director's message is "worldly life is worth living", well then, they succeeded. I would recommend this film to anyone; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
