Because "cruel" would be the only word that exists to describe the intentions of these directors. Where do you start too? In a breath of burr, I will begin with the horrible recitation of almost everyone in this film. Scratch that. Almost does not belong to that sentence. I can't even think of a character who was portrayed well. Although, in all honesty, it would be almost impossible to portray these characters in zero size effectively. However, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I don't intentionally include - I'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, eclipsed only by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was terrible. He tried to reflect the brilliance that was the first but failed in so many ways. Virtually every part of it has been useless, although I will admit (reluctantly) that the twist was pretty good is its surprise. And the finish was at least slightly humorous. But this movie is up there with the worst I've seen. Don't watch it Don't do it. There is absolutely no value in watching it. None. Take away only the fun of the first.
