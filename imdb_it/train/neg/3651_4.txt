I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I had a movie with some funny jokes and many just didn't work. I didn't like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would have been more fun if they had just had someone new, instead of resurrected Moriarty. Some of the things were fun. Burt Kwouk was a lot of fun, as always. McCloud on horseback was fun. McGarrett of Hawaii for 5-0 was not even like McGarrett. Connie Booth is obviously very good with accents. She is originally from Indiana, but has played quite well English and New York. Unfortunately, it wasn't presented much in the script. I was expecting a more fun movie. Instead, I had a rather confused film with a poor script. Quite ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this. Perhaps they were about to break into 77.
