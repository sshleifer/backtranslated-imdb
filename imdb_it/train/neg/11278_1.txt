this film is simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning accusation not only for the British film industry, but for talentless hackers at work today. Not only did the film get mainstream distribution, but it also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? I don't know and I simply don't care enough to involve the debate because the film was so terrible that it doesn't deserve any thought. be warned and stay away from this garbage. but apparently I need to write ten lines of text in this review, so I could even detail the plot. A nobleman of a man is set by his evil friend and collaborator by the company of his father and thus leads to a meeting with the Russian mafia and accents shady and stupid, very stupid twists. I should have asked for my money back but maybe I was still in shock over the experience. if you want a good crime movie look at the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock .... this is the peak of the contemporary British crime film .....
