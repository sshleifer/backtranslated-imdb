ORCA isn't exactly bad, but it's not even the most beautiful hour of Richard Harris. Like a demented fisherman, similar to Ahab, Harris hurls himself into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the "wife" and the unborn baby of the whale. Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris. She screams to him how important it is to leave nature alone. He doesn't listen and somehow ends up in the arctic fighting the revenge of the whale. There are no special effects to talk about except for what looks like a round mirror to a whale's eye --- there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eyes so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is. Bo Derek, as one of Harris' crew members had a particularly unpleasant experience with the Orca and most of the supporting cast, including Robert Carridine, Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn, don't get along very well.
