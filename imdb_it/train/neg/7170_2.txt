Yikes made this hit in the cinema. The characters were weak, the plot weaker. I thought this couldn't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He must have done it because he was bored and needed money. The characters had to be Irish, but none had an Irish accent. I'm trying desperately to find something nice in this, I can't, except Walken has done a good job with a wooden character. Find something to read, or watch the discovery, never see this movie.
