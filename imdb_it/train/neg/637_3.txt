The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is an ordinary way. Maybe it was different in the 1930s but who would like to see the life of a farmer. It's not very interesting for me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do a great job of acting but the film has been dragged too long. I may have told you the ending of this film from the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small peasant who does not want to be like his father, turns out to be exactly like him. Both fall in love with their wives just as they are on their deathbed. The film makes a complete 360 ​​going from one generation to another. Even this film had no character actors or funny moments, it was just depressing to talk about enduring as a farmer during a period of crisis.
