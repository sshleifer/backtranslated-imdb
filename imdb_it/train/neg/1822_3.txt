Greetings still from the darkness. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He directed two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had some good films ("Rainman"), but he always provided something interesting ... until now. I think the worst thing you can ever say about a play is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. I had never been a huge fan of pure slap stick ("Dumb and Dumber"), I was simply stunned by how awful this movie was. There are maybe 2 laughs in all - if you can pay attention so long. The best part of the film is the gag in execution of the song of the title of a sound-like Redbone. If the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress and I realize that everyone wants to do comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world exposes a weakness. SNL writer Amy Poehler is her usual exaggerated role as trailer park trash turned princess. The disaster of the film is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work to do together reveals promises, but later their chemistry disappears due to the poor script. This script is like most of the Black Jack character's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope of success.
