I'm a fan of Batman's movie and TV. I loved the show (new and old) and loved all the movies. But this film is not as exceptional as some people hoped it would be. In my opinion, it is a great disappointment. I think the problem was that he had no drama. Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm and Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker has had a lot of drama. and Batman & Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero also had some drama. Also, I think this film is in the light for Batman. The only scene that seems a little dark is the big fight with Bane at the end. Anyway, it's a movie by Batman ok. But I'd just rent it.
