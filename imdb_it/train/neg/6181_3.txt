If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie could be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and didn't even know about the existence of this film until the day before its release, when the advertising company panicked and held Music Row with dozens of flyers and billboards . However, it lasted only two weeks in the halls. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing and poor production only begin to describe this film embarrassment. For beginners, the names are a bit too much: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's line deliveries are slow and ask us which production assistant got stuck holding the check papers out of the camera. Angel's character quickly moves from his most casual way to a cowgirl, slipping into southern jargon after two days on the ranch. His wardrobe shifts from a chic version to a female version of Toby's - in fact, in the final scene, their clothes are identical, marveling that the wardrobe assistant called him sick. <br /> <br /> The audio is incoherent - perhaps the most obvious example is when Toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's screaming in a gym. <br /> <br /> There is never enough explanation or character development to be based on what happens on the screen. Exaggeration, exasperation, grimaces and humor best describe the interpretation and direction of the actors of the terrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after having consumed a couple of alcoholic drinks and in the company of your closest friends. But it's not saying much.
