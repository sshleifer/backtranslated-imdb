MASTERS OF HORROR, with his partner MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that started so auspicious with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it does nothing that could interest a relatively adult audience, instead focusing on TEN-YEAR-OLDS, which are able to count only the envelopes for the body and, to barely, those. And so the coarseness is the king, and the king is gross. <br /> <br /> Is Stephen King simply illiterate? in general he has the aptitude for the narration of Bart Simpson. Since he can't read his only inspiration are the movies. <br /> <br /> True, cinema is not a bad place to start, as it has generally escaped the onslaught of "realism". But these films are just the voice, not the thing, and if you want to WRITE, you have to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as intimate acquaintances. But even so, it should be clear to any university student that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what is wrong. One can almost imagine this sad pain sitting while his desk tries to invent something of SCARY. <br /> <br /> Not, careful, trying to accurately describe the horror of the system of which it is an integral part, making the stupid fool, but trying to invent a scary story for his grandson. Suppose you were paralyzed and people thought you were dead and you started cutting yourself like they do those autopsy things! Wouldn't it be serious? And this, boys and girls, is history. <br /> <br /> And the characterization? Oh yes, it's one of these seeds, which has never really appreciated life, you know, and now it's too late, right? And he's screaming ?? well, they can't really hear it, you know ?? he's saying he'll sue the hospital, but it's not that big anymore, see, lying there (or posing, I can't remember) and all the rest. And he's thinking: Oh no please, please don't cut me and this is terrible, lying (or posing) like that ?? Now wouldn't that be a great story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do it, I think it was the great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of that snake again, oh yes, a BOOMSLANG ?? It has a nice sound, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> Let's do it a PERUVIAN BOOMSLANG! Sure, Steve, is it great ?? except that BOOMSLANG is Afrikaans, idiot! But how can you really say that the target audience is children, and not just mental defects? It's easy: there is no sex. <br /> <br /> Well, there is, but it is the type glimpsed by a crack in the door of our parents' bedroom. Modern directors are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the hunt. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON they have no idea what's going on. All that remains is the laugh out of the SM club and the fascist creed that people with sexual preferences are inherently bad. <br /> <br /> Despite a certain size discrepancy, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no titillation in this, must he torture her first ?? not in any way that can excite her, you understand, since that would upset our puritan feelings. And so, the horror and romance become simply unpleasant and the treatment of psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero, you see, is a rubber fetishist, and can only get a disgrace if someone touches him that you know there with you to know ?? rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they find out that he is, in fact, you know. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this is the author at the peak of his powers of inspiration. Too bad, they cut it off, since it could have bothered the FIVE YEARS watching the show!
