The final mating of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete bonfire. The script is weak and has been poorly presented. The film has no life. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better at making a concert filmed for their final match. There is nothing wrong with their singing, it's everything else in this turkey that is overcooked.
