Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can't stand Ben anymore. How this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me. I can't understand how this happens if I perform at work the way it plays in a film that would fire me and that I own the company ..... I should fire myself. GOD! This film was just a stack of simple, smoldering, smoky POO, which should have been vaporized if it were possible. Something else I must say that the guideline on 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What's wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I'll never understand why sites require a short novel written when sometimes a short comment is all that is needed.
