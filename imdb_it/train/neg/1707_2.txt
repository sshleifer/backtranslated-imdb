and a budget of $ 30,000 and this movie still looks like it's made for $ 50. From the first frame to the last one understands that he didn't care a little about the continuity or the plot of the films, he was just happy to make a film about zombies. <br /> <br /> What the end result shows is a lazy director who loves zombie movies. It would have been great if he had had a cure. The final result is an infinite zoom on the badly done gore, and on it is also played a metal even more poor. <br /> <br /> What happens when you combine high hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and an idiot behind the camera.
