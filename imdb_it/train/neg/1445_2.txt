OK. Not a bad film if it came from an original script. BUT IT IS NOT! <br /> <br /> Which part of "in this story there are no women, except for Foulata and Gagoola", did Haggard's introduction make producers, directors and writers understand? I mean, it's a fairly simple English. I understood it at the age of 10! The beauty of KSM is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, colonial Africa, the relentless desert and Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. This should be more than enough even for the most mediocre producers to work with. But nooo, they have to throw "romance" into it. Pathetic. Suggestion to all of you poor souls who actually thought that this would be close to the book. Give up. Until an aspirant of Peter Jackson arrives and "does well" one could also continue to re-read the tome. By the way, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-that) called Allan's wife. It gives a background to the history of Quatermain. It's a bit scary but good.
