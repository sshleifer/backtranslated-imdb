After seeing this DVD after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005, I came here to find it - but after reading the other comments, I don't have the heart. Clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age. Well, don't be a Grinch suit; could still work for some children - if they are not too saturated by the media and have not become visually too sophisticated, eg. from watching all the LOTRs and Harry Potter. But if you're an adult, stay miles away; You won't like it. <br /> <br /> The beautiful pieces: Barbara Kellerman in the role of the Witch, especially in her first scenes with Edmund, creates just the right mix of charismatic wickedness and contained madness. (At the stone table she goes a little over.) Michael Aldridge in the minor role of professor and Jeffrey S. Perry as Mr. Tumnus also have the kind of lucid and skillful acting that we would expect from the best BBC dramas. And Aslan's costume works very well, considering incredibly well. They have the right eyes. <br /> <br /> The pieces: almost everything else, but in particular two areas. One, the casting. England is full of good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive children from British schools. How could they end up with these four reinforcements? They move like wooden soldiers and speak as well. Peter has no gravitas or charisma (and is visibly shorter than his presumably younger brothers); Edmund is only whining; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically, visibly, drastically wrong for this part that I can't imagine how she got the job. <br /> <br /> Two animal costumes. Again, they seem to have worked for some children. If children are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting and believable characters, they could be ecstatic about this movie. But for a spectator with the sophistication of, say, a twelve-year-old who saw Prisoner Of Azkaban? When Mr. Beaver comes out from behind that tree, there will be cries of cruel and derisive laughter. The costumes simply don't work - I couldn't, and I think that no modern adult or teenager can't, suspend disbelief by looking at Mister Beaver. The animation drawn later (gryphon, etc.) works better, is easier to take. <br /> <br /> So: ten stars for the very young and tender soul; everyone else reads or re-reads the book and watches the far better film unfolding in your imagination.
