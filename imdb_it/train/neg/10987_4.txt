I really enjoyed the Margaret Atwood novel "The Robber Bride", and I was thrilled to see that there was a film version. A woman frames a boyfriend of policemen for her own murder, and her friend, a former journalist, tries to erase her name by checking out the dead woman's crazy friends. It is fortunate that the script of the film resolves the clumsy plot of Mrs. Atwood focusing on the story of these two men, victims of intriguing women ... <br /> <br /> Heh. Okay, you got me. If these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure they are entirely made up for the movie, I'll eat the dust cover on my hardcover. Apparently, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to bring the film. Zenia's manipulations are not interesting if we don't see them happening to a man, and a man's life is ruined. Roz, Charis and Toni tell their stories - to a man. Because it is not important if a man does not hear them. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushed aside for a man's story. I don't normally look for feminist corners in the media, and I tried to enjoy the film as it is. If I had not read the book, I could have enjoyed the film much more. So if you like the cop and the ex-cop and you want to learn more about them, you're unlucky. Read the novel, if you want to enjoy a flattering prose and subtly layered characterization through a plot. It is the same plot: the film has dug it, stretched it and sprinkled it with male anguish. It's like Zenia's revenge on Margaret Atwood.
