There is nothing better than watching giant robots fighting in a desolate desert area, and Robot Wars is able to provide. Of course, acting is bad, dialogue is sub-par, and the characters are one-dimensional, but it has giant robots! The special effects are actually quite good for the period. They are certainly not as refined as today's standards, but contain a minimum of computer graphics and use thumbnails instead, so it has aged quite well. His shortcomings are easily overlooked given the short run time of the film, and he has a certain ironic humor in parts that make it quite funny. I would recommend it to all fans of giant robot or science fiction cheese who are looking for a distressing distraction.
