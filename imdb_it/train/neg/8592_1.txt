Making a film at the turn of the prequels and the "real" Star Wars trilogy would also charge a great filmmaker .... Mr. Lucas is not that director. <br /> <br /> To represent the fall of a good man in the dark he needs a good actor ... Mr Christensen is not that actor. <br /> <br /> The first 60-80 minutes are overwhelmingly boring with only a few pockets of even lighter saber fights, but there is a lack of advantage because you already know which main characters survive the original Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) has a very fleeting role here and the best idea is to have Jar Jar Binks in silence! <br /> <br /> No, the film resumes only with the Chancellor who lights the Jedi and has a great sequence (too long) at the lava falls
