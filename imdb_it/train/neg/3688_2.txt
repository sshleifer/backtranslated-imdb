As usual, I went to see this film for A. Rahman. Otherwise, the film is not good. Rajni wanted to end his film career with this film, he would have succeeded. But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure. After this he delivered a success with Chandramukhi. I'm eagerly awaiting your next Shivaji arrival. <br /> <br /> I have read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting as the user is also from TN. Rajni is an actor who acts, I believe, from his heart and not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age. <br /> <br /> In any case, I need to fill 10 lines for this comment ... so I wish Rajni good luck ...... .....
