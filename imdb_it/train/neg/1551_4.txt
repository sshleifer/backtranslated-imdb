The Ladies Man is a fun movie. There's not much to think about, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? Actually it's better than most SNL movies (ie Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very funny. Chris Parnell was also fun in his short scene (one of the funniest in the film). Besides that, the rest of the cast is average and is there just to support Meadows. I've certainly seen more fun movies, but I've seen even the most stupid ones. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's okay for some laughter. However it was more fun like a skit. But anyway, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend this. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 6/10
