I can't believe I actually sat for the whole thing. This movie has the worst acting from Killjoy. <br /> <br /> Here is a brief summary of the plot: The movie starts with Jojo and that other girl sitting on the beach, drooling over a skinny blond-haired beach "Hunk" that seems not to have been in the gym one day on his life. Somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants it. UH OH! Here's the competition! The stereotype "hot chick" and her best friends, who drive a bad pink car. We soon find out that Jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in Australia, which means that Jojo should move and leave his best friend behind (oh no, I think I'll cry). A great storm comes and fills the pool with bad water. Somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and finds himself face to face, yes, you guessed it, a SIREN! This is where the "story" really takes off. Basically, they want the siren to fall in love with the "piece". <br /> <br /> This is a pre-adolescent film with such bad acting, which makes the 80's the pinnacle of an Oscar-worthy performance. This film has all the possible clich√©s ... the best friends, the "hunk" everyone wants, the bad girl "hot" and her friends assholes, the scary old man ... you call him, he's in there. I took one for a lot of people looking at this. Consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice for you. Please don't watch this movie. Don't do it so I suffered in vain.
