I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of having a good idea of ​​how things are going in the background in a large opera production. I must say I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The sets of a Wagnerian production must necessarily be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead, what we got is a jumble of clips of people moving around large landscape objects, vaguely helped together with a comment that failed to keep my attention. I found myself mainly listening to the background clips of the music of the works. I was impressed by the enormity of the effort required to make such a production - which seemed pretty good to me and next time I'm at work I'm sure I'll remember that part in this video - but I was a little embarrassed by the lack of detailed comments and explanations.
