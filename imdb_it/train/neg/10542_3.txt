Detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) has a big problem in his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober), for whom the extraordinary psychic Tess (Tracy Griffith) helped him capture, was resurrected with The First Power (.. given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber) and may possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess (who has an understanding of what they are facing), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die from his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite (Elizabeth Arlen) who tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but was denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing ... a cross with a blade that can penetrate into the heart of Channing who rids the world of his evil. He will take it anyway and give Russell a hand, which will need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess who prepares her for some sort of satanic ritual / ceremony. <br /> <br /> In the movie Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable supporting actor, he gets the role of partner of Russell ... so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he tries to kill Channing, he is simply murdering the weak host of another poor soul he owns. <br /> <br /> Pure hidden garbage ... stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give it to them, but in a stroke they have no chance. Kober, who is usually always as effective as the heavy man, is actually not given to anything more than a bad fool who jumps in the air and throws rotten jokes.
