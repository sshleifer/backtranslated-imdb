The woman in the wig, who "dyes" the hair in the middle of the film (= wig grips) presumably does not see what the public can see from miles away: <br /> <br /> *** the spoiler starts alert * ** that his hubby has an affair with his best friend and they both try to get rid of it. *** end of the spoiler alarm *** <br /> <br /> And what a spoiler it was: the title already gives it, right? Bad acting, bad script: waste of time Oh yes: in the end, she lives happily ever after .... <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed this movie, you will really love "Cannibal women in the avocado" Jungle of Death "....
