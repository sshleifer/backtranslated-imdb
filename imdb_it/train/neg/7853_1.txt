No plot, disgusting acting and meaningless blood .... <br /> <br /> Should this be a horror movie? There is no fear, or suspense, only BOOM BANG GORE, so done. Some Marines are in the desert for some strange, disgusting reason and are chased by those mutant beasts from the first movie, which was good, and should have been left to that. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money, and the use of useless violence, just like the sequels to "Saw". They know no matter how useless the plot is, and the more gore they can add, the people will see it. I miss the good suspense horror movies. Let's go to Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
