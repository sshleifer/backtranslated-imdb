If you want a non-binding and reasonably fun time or so, then it's okay to watch it. It's not so bad, really. Yes, there are more errors in logic than I care to describe here and it could tax people's patience - like me, I have to admit - that they are inclined to throw things on TV, sometimes, but it's fun at least. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY fun, there's no need to let yourself be disappointed. <br /> <br /> However, if you've read the book - or one of Brookmyre's other books - then you probably better avoid it. I read them all and when I saw this movie for the first time, I despised it. I trashed it in detail and in depth on another site, in fact. The television plot has virtually no relevance to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many loyal (and openly angry) Brookmyre fans. <br /> <br /> The best tips ...? Look at this, then read the book and only THEN you make your comparisons and send your opinion.
