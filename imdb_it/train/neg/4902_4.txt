Almost in the same league as Yonfan's rather atrocious Color Blossoms, Spider Lillies leads the point that it is possible to make a cutting-edge cinema without the margin, or a lot on the way to cut. It is a Taiwanese film, which from day to day is becoming a novelty at an alarming rate, but more than that tidbit, we can find very little in the way of noteworthy here. <br /> <br /> You should know that apparently Spider Lillies is also a lesbian-themed story, but in every respect this is nothing but a plastic ploy to lure you into the easily seduced and gullible. In several ways we have a repeat here of the recent Taiwanese release Eternal Summer. Then the homosexuals received treatment for the exchange of courts, now we have the same thing with women. Zero Chou presents, for your non-existent construction, a story that will probably titillate at most a fifteen year old. They somehow managed to take care of the art house, but in the end this translates into a very foolish raid, simply not interesting. <br /> <br /> The corner of Hong Kong comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diario), here it still shows off its butcher appearance. Although she is quite nice in her previous work, Isabella in Spider Lillies is listless and deprived of most of the departments. Either his heart was not important to us, or the whole lesbian drama didn't like his sensitivity very much. <br /> <br /> Makes a shy tattoo artist from Taipei, solitary and responsible for a mentally challenged younger brother, played by John Shen, who fortunately grants the film its only redeeming feature linked to the theatrical theme. The character of Isabella, strangely called Takeko, but presumably coming from Hong Kong, soon links up with the young disinherited Jade (Rainie Yang from the famous Meteor Garden). The latter lives with her grandmother and has a long list of complaints due to her parents and life in general. Of course, the grandmother's component works well and is moving, but for Jade, as a protagonist, he is just as motionless as his counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and a lot of inadequately covered angst, with Jade working as a webcam girl while Takeko keeps his father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of an ornate lilly spider on the arm. Jade also wants to acquire this same design, which leads Takeko to explore the internal feelings of the problem through flashbacks and a rather minimal discourse with the Jade swords. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is a little speech to write the base, is it at least the memorable report? In a word, no. They kiss and pretend to be nasty near the end, but just as Eternal Summer reminded us not long ago, there is a gulf measured in light years between showing sexual content and making ticket buyers believe they are about to see content sexual. > <br /> This cynical construction of expectations seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak story, acting and a total lack of relics to take away with you to the theater, this kind of Color Blossoms images looks good, come to think of it. At least there we have some Teresa Cheung's udders. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be struck by the playlist of the most banal and timid GLB film festival. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly for a pseudo-indie version, not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce inspirational moments. This is the same, since it makes it much easier to pass Spider Lillies. Believe it, avoid it and you will not miss anything good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
