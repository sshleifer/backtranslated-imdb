I don't see many reasons to get into this film in a very detailed way. Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo, author and survivor of "A Season in Hell", recruited from his prison by his only friend, Major Richard Crenna, to secretly return to Vietnam, photograph the American prisoners who are believed to be still being held in horrible camps and back without involving the enemy. <br /> <br /> Fat chance. And what if he really hadn't done anything but sneak in, take pictures and run away? Who would come to see the film? <br /> <br /> It is essentially a celebration of Stallone's muscles. Preparing for his mission, we see his well-oiled muscles swell. (They are oiled and swollen everywhere.) There is the ritual that holds on black skin, ugly cannons and even uglier knives. The black cannons are cleaned, assembled with clacks of sound and almost oiled like Stallone's muscles. The bow is tested and, yes, it has enough weight to push a dart through an enemy's forehead. The knife is sharpened with artillery blows. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of his prisoners of war are betrayed by one or two seeds of Washington, cynical politicians who, you can bet, have never even been punched in grammar school. No courage, you know? Just sit with your feet on the desk and drink foreign beer. <br /> <br /> The film does what it aims to do, but what it aims to do is meritorious. It deliberately collects the popular myth in the mid-1980s that there were countless numbers of MIAs silently kept in miserable fields by the northern Vietnamese. Bumper stickers were ubiquitous. (Let's free my MIAs.) Why should they keep them? It has never been reasoned enough, but perhaps to turn prisoners of war into a slave labor force - in a country that has absolutely no other resources than labor. Or perhaps because of their propagandistic value as a tool to humiliate the United States - a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world. <br /> <br /> As a prisoner, Rambo is treated in a medieval manner from North Vietnamese. Nestled in his neck in pig droppings and then pulled out of it by his wrists, his muscles still showing. So, not happy with the Vietnamese subhumans, a Russian officer is called to play the Gestapo officer - "Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember". A high-tech type, Russian uses psychology and electricity, not just a pig dump. <br /> <br /> Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until "this country loves us as much as we love it" by raising another myth that veterinarians returning from Vietnam have been spit evenly and cursed , which is why I suppose we have elected so many in Congress and appointed others to high positions. The last three presidential candidates at a loss were among those despised. At least the room left adrift by Rambo leaves open for a sequel, which arrived immediately. <br /> <br /> Action films with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others have been leavened by beats but Rambo has no sense of humor. He marches through his phantasmal ideological swamp, killing mercilessly, barely speaking, barely able to speak. Speaking is a sign of weakness.
