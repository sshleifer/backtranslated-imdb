Well, where do I start my story? I went to this movie tonight with some friends who no longer knew about the actors that were in it, and that was supposed to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Well, I understood in the first 20 minutes, what a wrong decision I had made to come out and see this movie. The plot was crap, and so was the script. The lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically. <br /> <br /> The cast could not have been more plastic. Even some scenes seemed to have been made much faster ... as if they were dragged without any particular reason. Very poor editing. <br /> <br /> All in all this film was a huge waste of time and money. Boo.
