It's not a bad start for the program - but that slap in the face of real law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it tries to get paid like a reality, and it's anything but. The men and women who devote their lives to law enforcement deserve better. What is the next medical school in a minute? Charo running lipo? Does Charles Grodin help replace the hip? Come on ... show some respect. Even the citizens of Muncie are organizing the program as staged. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor editing (how many times can they use the car-to-car shot of the Taco Bell in the background?), Siren effects (which add to the nausea with every 'call', regardless of the slide code or not), and finally, but not less important - more security problems than the officers you could shake. <br /> <br /> If I want to see the manufactured policemen and the fake policemen, I would look at RENO 911.
