I agree with the last reviewer that this film had a terrible acting. Yes, there was a lot of blood and some nudity. But it has been overshadowed by a slow and meaningless weave and a stupid ending. Where was he supposed to film it anyway: a Canadian Chinatown or Hong Kong? The hostel was a much better film and I would recommend seeing it. A technical annoyance I had with the DVD is that if you break the Spanish subtitles, they come back after some scenes and then you have to go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Also, don't waste your time in deleted scenes because there is no audio and it just looks like a tourist movie.
