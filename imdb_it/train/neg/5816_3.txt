From the critical applause, I expected more from this film and from Tamara Jenkins. The story took place slowly and didn't seem to have a dot or a plot. And I find it hard to believe that a 14-year-old girl (aged for her age or not) would be so blissful in getting the loss of her "finished" virginity. Maybe I'm too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no trouble connecting with the Shakespeare stories in Love or Life is Beautiful and I wasn't alive for any of those locations. The cast is very good, but unfortunately for them the script didn't allow them to engage the public. Overall, Slums has had its moments but, unless you want to remember the scallops and tubular stockings, I'd say skip this one.
