The only way this is a family drama is if the parents explain everything that is wrong with their message. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating the food after killing its mother and initially pontificating on taking responsibility for its own actions. They blame bears and deer for "misbehaving" by eating while not taking responsibility for using proper locks and enclosures or even learning to shoot instead of twice mutilating animals and letting them linger.
