As I sat submissive to this television mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree with this garbage? The film uses senseless plot lines and invented to deliver waste to thousands of homes. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The film made no sense, and all credibility was lost due to the excessive use of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this film useful, but in the end he needs to remember the old adage that you can't polish an asshole. I hope you didn't waste your New Year watching another mindless movie made for TV. Now I know why the networks started broadcasting Sunday night series to get rid of the garbage!
