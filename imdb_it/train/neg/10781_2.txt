In fact, it never was. I'm not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a screwball comedy from the 1940s. What a blank vacuum! None of these people approach a Cary Grant, Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, etc., And anyway, today's audience is not as receptive to this easy slime. Writing is trivial The trivial plot is as thin as a razor. The chemistry between the protagonists is non-existent. It is interesting that Julia Roberts seems convinced that she is a reincarnation of a great star of the golden age of Hollywood, at any time. It is an effect that he feels and cannot yet reach with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride.
