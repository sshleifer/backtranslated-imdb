It is difficult to describe this film and you want to try not to discard it too quickly because you have the feeling that this could be the perfect movie for a 12 year old girl ... <br /> <br /> the film has a nice idea : the modern version of Sleeping Beauty with an extra touch. He has some pretty dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the boy's relationship with his working single mother and his schoolmate ... a good start could be said, but then he got a little greedy, very greedy, trying to be a science fiction, a drama, a thriller, a possible romantic love story, a fairy tale, a comedy and everything under the sun. The result has just left the public rather inadequate. For example, the scene where the girl (played by Risa Goto) finally woken up by her kiss (Yuki Kohara), instead of being romantic, tries to scare us to make us laugh later ... it's a cheap trick, because it spoils the whole Waiting and the excitement he was trying to build for the better half of the film. <br /> <br /> I have not read the original story on which the film is based (it is the well-known work by the comic artist Osamu Tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories) I wonder if all the problems exist in the original story or have they occurred in the adaptation? It is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the "fussy logic" of those Japanese comics. For example, how did the character of Yuki Kohara get to the hospital in an instant (when she assumed it was a long bus journey) to escape from the character of Risa Goto in front of the cameras immediately after seeing her live interview on the television? <br /> <br /> There are also some scenes that are copied directly (very little creative!) from other films and all look pretty useless, that is. the famous scene "The mouth of the lion has a good hand" from "the" Roman Party "<br /> <br /> The film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing ... it cannot be a fairy tale and he hasn't had enough jokes to be a comedy ... and strangely there are scenes that even look like an involuntary "ghost" movie, but you have to give him credit that he managed to capture some of the feelings of the Japanese teenager. <br /> < br /> It is watching this film that I have the feeling that there may be some films that should have come with a warning label that said "this film could only be suitable for people under 18", it would definitely be on the poster of this movie. <br /> <br />
