In line with the famous Disney theft practice ... I mean ... buy known properties and bastardize them, this live version of the cartoon classic was one of the worst replicas in a year of bad re-brands. I grew up in the original cartoon TV series. Each episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughter than this entire movie. Not present is the beautiful electronic book by Penny. There is also no gag with self-destructive orders that always end up detonating the head. The new ones are a convertible gadget that speaks plainly (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical unrealistic love story. Don't fill the boxes to pay the Disney executives and even their _ex_executives - don't watch this movie. <br /> <br />
