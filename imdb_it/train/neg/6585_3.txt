In reviewing this film, I can only pass my weekend warrior experiences doing my basic training in July, August and September 1971 at that point in the garden, Fort Polk, Louisiana. Take the High Ground was not at all like I remember the basic training. <br /> <br /> But it must be remembered at the time that this was South Korea that ended in a stalemate, but it was a conventional war as we knew it. It was not Vietnam, a guerrilla in the jungle where we kept pouring the squads into an endless pit. The draft at that time was unwelcome, but accepted as still necessary for the defense of the country. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a Korean veteran now assigned to the state to train troops to go overseas. The film is about one of his training cycles and the men of the platoon he has to train. They are the usual type that you would find in almost all the war films of the previous decade. <br /> <br /> One thing I will praise Take The High Ground is that MGM has recognized that our army was now integrated with the presence of William Hazard as a black recruit in the platoon. It was in keeping with the spirit of the changing times. <br /> <br /> But I will say that a recruit like Russ Tamblyn would be healed from his intelligent mouth from day one. Richard Widmark would not have risked death or become a eunuch to trust Jerome Courtland with a weapon. And in no way would he have worried so much about the abandonment of Robert Arthur. He just let the MPs take care of him. <br /> <br /> Of course, having been filmed in and around Fort Bliss and El Paso, Texas gave Take the High Ground good authenticity. But see it as an army recruitment film and you can certainly understand why the government gave so much enthusiasm to cooperation during the day. <br /> <br /> I remember that the sergeants have their own little conflicts that you could pick up on when you weren't worried that it was something that was 95% of the time. But there is no way that Karl Malden would have stunned Widmark in the open field during training in front of several witnesses among the recruits. Both would have realized that it would undermine authority, something that the army simply does not let happen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could say something better about Take The High Ground because I certainly like its talented cast, it's the talented director Richard Brooks, also the silly theme of Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington, fresh from their Oscar a year earlier for High Noon. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay and Story by Millard Kaufman. It must have been Kaufman's vivid imagination.
