"That exhibition of Malcom on FOX is really doing a murder ... can't we make our version?" I speculate and paraphrase, of course, but we all know in our hearts that it is true, and that the only thing NBC added to the metric "Malcom" was sex. And, boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> 13-year-old Tucker gets a boner and covers it with his skateboard. Tucker accidentally enters his aunt in the shower and she accuses him of having observed her and having beaten her. She spies the cute girl in the next house from her bedroom window, and she knows she wants to see her topless, but she teases him smiling and closing the window. And that's all in the pilot. <br /> <br /> Take it from an adult man - a boy's puberty is so crazy about sex and headboard it's impossible to make it fun for a mainstream audience. The only times someone approached was in the movies, and you can count them on one side. So it's no surprise that "Tucker" has the warmth and charm of a strip club bathroom. Did the network actually think we wanted to see children try puberty? Isn't this the stuff people go to jail for? If you doubt the depravity of the show, consider this: 13 episodes were shot, but the NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes broadcast; they then made the unprecedented move to "burn" the remaining episodes by sending them at midnight so that no child could see them. Ironic because the children were originally the target audience. <br /> <br /> In addition to his general moodiness, Tucker presents a voiceover to the protagonist to give substance to the poor writing. Even in 2000 it was horribly dated, with its incidental ska music and super-sarcasm. I didn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't arrive exactly at a mile a minute ... Shame on NBC for this scam ... they are better than that. <br /> <br /> GRADE: C-
