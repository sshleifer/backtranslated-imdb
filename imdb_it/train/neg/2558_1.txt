I had to review this for a website, and I watched with optimism that maybe it would have been at least a cheesy but fun, and it didn't go well enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is probably one of the worst supernatural thrillers I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes that rip "The Omen" shamelessly. The ending is also very similar to the way "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that acting, writing and history are all trivial. If these films make money, I'm sad to see where Asylum is headed. It's embarrassing.
