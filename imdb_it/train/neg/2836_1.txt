I saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf. And before I got my first VCR, I thought I had baptized it with this little gem and it's bad to shoot at its best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is inadvertently hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And just like Christopher Walken he seemed to want to act in every bad movie in his last years. This film is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It has lines like "Shut up and let me FIGHT !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You're saying a lot of shit!" <br /> <br /> And the invaluable return: "Unfortunately it is sh_it, hard anger sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You will be surprised by a fighting scene while Bo does a SOMMERSAULT on a pool table! And it makes a nice kung fu kick when it comes out of the roll! Chop socky action and T and A shivering !!! <br /> <br /> Which Schlock fan could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and returns to haunt Bo like a ghost, she asks him why he killed himself rather than face his debilitating illness? He says "Real men don't eat quiche". <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo was a clever cookie, he would have called an exorcist right there and now!
