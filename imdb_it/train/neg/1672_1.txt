This is the only film I have ever seen that prompted me to write a criticism on any website, and this is a significant statement from someone who likes "The Monolith attack". This film is perfect for anyone who wants a harmless film. For example, it is devoid of sex and violence. I believe this film is safe for children of all ages. This film is perfect for those who don't want to be entertained, challenged or stimulated in any way. Adults could easily catch up on TV while the children watch this movie. Don't be surprised, however, if you wake up to find the kids have turned off the TV and started a board game. As an adult who likes to be entertained, who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism, drama, comedy and action, all those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination, this film has nothing to offer.
