A friend told me about John Fante last summer, after having a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I didn't know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski, an author with a similar margin and humor, except a generation before. 'Ask the Dust' was Fante's first book I read and remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant article about a sad and frightened young writer who posed himself and the outside world as a superb author, endowed with a masterly talent who had no idea how to write about real-world experiences of which he had no . In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he would desperately want to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, of how he is satisfied with his first sexual experience with a "wounded" admirer and how in the end nothing remains but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, without touching Hollywood . The film adaptation remains faithful to the book for a while, but winds its way through the cinematic trap of love by persevering through racism, illness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is an idiot and Camilla is insane, and their love has never been and never would have been true, no matter how much they both wanted to find each other. This film has torn the true meaning of history and replaced with schlock. I can't believe that the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that was so wrong.
