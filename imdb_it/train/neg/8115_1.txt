This film was the most horrible movie experience I've ever had to endure, and what's worse is that I had to watch it, and I didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school! Of course, the plot was decent ... but I found the acting terrible! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste, I thought her performance was wonderful. It was the only attraction, without her, I doubt I could bear to watch the movie. Every time I hear someone say "daarling" it makes me shudder! I almost attacked a customer the other day because they said "it". It reminded me of one of the worst hours and a half of my life! <br /> <br /> (I apologize if this has offended anyone, I am just expressing my opinion)
