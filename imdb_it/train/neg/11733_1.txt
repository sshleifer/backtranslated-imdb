I'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie .. I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through scenes that weren't meant to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but honestly the plot of this film needed the MAJOR review. It didn't even make sense, one second the characters wonder what they're exactly puffing ... at the next scene they are hopelessly addicted and figure out how to do it ?? Even the ending has just taken the cake .. I'm not going to ruin the magnificent conclusion ... but it's practically added to the rest of the horrible plot / script ... see this movie for comedy, if you have to ..
