I really hoped that this would be a fun show, given all the hype and smart preview clips. And let's talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the creator of the show on BBC World Today - a show broadcast all over the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show does not even come close to delivery. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that sounds a bit funny the first time you hear them, but then they look like limping - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm kind). It's the classic CBC recipe, one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you should be stupid to believe some of the white characters, and if you are white you will probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all white characters are portrayed as bigots, ignorant both of them. Not that teasing whites is a problem - most of the best comedies are rooted in this. It's just a problem when it's not fun - like in this show. <br /> <br /> Canada is full of funny people - so many that we regularly export them to Hollywood. So why couldn't the producers of this show be able to find them?
