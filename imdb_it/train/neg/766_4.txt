Whenever a Columbo story deviates from the family plot (the colorful murderer commits crime, Columbo smokes the killer, Columbo becomes a plague in the process), writers somehow never able to match quality and interest in the more traditional episodes. This episode deviates to the extreme, and the result is an important flop. <br /> <br /> Would you believe: Columbo will never face the villain to the end? !! <br /> <br /> Frankly, I was tempted to turn it off for about two thirds. <br /> <br /> Oh, the sacrifices that self-appointed reviewers make !!!
