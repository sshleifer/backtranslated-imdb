First of all I really enjoyed myself with Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2. This film was total garbage. I couldn't bear to look at it. The plot was a joke, the acting was a joke and the fact that Zombi 3 had nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke. <br /> <br /> Let's move from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE. In any case, this film is not worth $ 1.00 which it costs to rent it. I really liked Lucio Fulci movies but this was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how zombies 4 and 5 will be present, I believe I will skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a fantastic flip tho.
