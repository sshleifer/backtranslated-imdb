Spoiler? Maybe some details, but nothing related to the plot. Not like it would be important with this film. <br /> <br /> Air Rage blasts the premise of mid-air infiltration of the executive decision blatantly. Ice-T leads a team of four "elite" commandos wearing large black shirts that we can only imagine must hide the invisible armor while their idiotic tactics (similar to those used by third grade children when they play Star Wars in playground) take them to absorb a hail of shots. <br /> <br /> What amused me most about this film was the use of look-alike actors. You will immediately recognize Cyril O'Reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, even though it was a long time ago that you probably won't be able to place it (it was from Porky). Here Cyril plays a discreet knock-off of a Bill Paxton character. Most of the hilarious is the pig Gil Gerard, who is so fat you will never recognize him as the Buck Rogers television movie. Instead of evoking his slightly heroic past, Gerard gives us a passable performance of the robust and robust character, which was clearly imagined for John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a beautiful hybrid performance similar to Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas. In the 10 years since New Jack City, the acting of Ice-T has deteriorated considerably. It does not act as a regurgitation of lines that it may have actually memorized. <br /> <br /> One of the objects that plays this film is a classified information CD-ROM. It is transported by hand and is apparently and incredibly unencrypted, despite Gerard's security aura of Gerard's NSA character. What a joke. I strongly doubt that the information supposed to be on the CD would ever be assembled in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Despite being in a closed plane without silencers, firearms are as noisy as canned air, and they can't make a person jump, so it doesn't look like a fake budget. The assortment of weapons chosen is rather amusing. The use of a coffee maker by the flight operator concerns the more realistic representation of violence in the film. When he uses the mini-Uzi gun intuitively, which must be one of the worst gun models ever, he is simply too stupid. A real elite team carried MP-5 for this kind of stuff or maybe SOCOMM .45s, or even custom Hi-Power if they were really old school, or maybe something FN 5.7 if new school ... The standard problem lame-or 92Fs are absolutely unbelievable, having lost most of their charm after the lethal weapon I. The villains, presumably a soldier of luck, have an assorted mixture of absurdities, such as the dubbed mini-Uzi gun and a Tec-9 with the notorious non-stretchable functional barrel that is not a silencer. <br /> <br /> There was a touch of realism on which I would like to correct other reviewers: the flight attendant and Ice-T dropped the aircraft to 10,000 feet for "breathable air" before opening the door . And I also had the impression that the flight attendant was NOT able to close the door, which in practice simply gave up on that point. As for the landing, there was no talk of a flap until about 2 seconds before the touchdown. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Only the Dukes of Hazard escaping Roscoe P. Coltrane on the "pass" could shame this film for the use of archive material. Obviously they chose the incredible (and withdrawn) SR-71 because they failed to get the supply of an F-117. Apart from the fact that they were already in mothballs as early as 2001, let us also forget for a moment that the SR-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the B-2, and that at close range ... Well, I'm not expert, but I doubt that it would be invisible on Radar. <br /> <br /> As others have pointed out, repeated references to "F-15s" when they showed F-16 were ridiculous. The details of 747 were pretty stupid. No airline would put those few passengers on a 747 to begin with, let alone everything that was idiotic about it. Pay attention to the use of exposed electrical cables. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Take it on the stars or something. Don't pay to rent it, but watch it to laugh. In the running for the worst film ever, right there with No Holds Barred, who at least had a bit of originality.
