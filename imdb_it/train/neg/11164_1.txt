What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This film seemed to want to copy a "cutting-edge" comedy, but the direction and script were sloppy, sickly and sentimental in the worst cinematographic tradition. The acting / role of Jack Black was self-indulgent and worrying ... and the other characters were equally unmasked and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We're (WERE) fans of Black but none of us has done more than one forced joke for the duration. Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We will not watch another of his films without reading the reviews more carefully before !! <br /> <br /> Were you drunk when you read the script before signing up for this drivel?
