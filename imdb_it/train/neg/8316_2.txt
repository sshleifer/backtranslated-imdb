Cedric Kahn's films have been based on characters rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it's shocking to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some strenuous attempts to give character to Succo . I don't find Stefano Cassetti an interesting actor; reminds me of professional athletes who are persuaded into films like Bret Favre. That blank look looks like a really ferocious deer caught in its headlights. A real actor would have forced us to think more about Succo's personality, rather than admiring his ability to kidnap. <br /> <br /> The little acting comes mainly from Isild le Besco while the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by assault. The police office interview is a marvel of stubborn obstinacy with a little fear of the future. Le Besco aside, there is little to recommend this film.
