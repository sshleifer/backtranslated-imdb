Alicia Silverstone (pre- "Clueless") plays a modern teenager obsessed with crime that attempts to solve the brutal killing of a local girl. Pat Verducci has written and directed this B-flick, which is not particularly well done, but is still surprisingly serious with regards to his main character. Silverstone is attractive and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the threatening kitsch of the photo. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last act is exaggerated. It is not a cheese camp fest, but not exceptionally memorable either. * 1/2 from ****
