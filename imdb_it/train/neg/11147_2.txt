I have nothing to comment on this film. It's so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" .. Anything you do, even fixing the walls is better. <br /> <br /> And since I have to write at least 10 lines of text, I also tell you that it is a low budget film, bad acting, no name actors, a stupid mutt like a wolf, and so on ... Even the story brings nothing new, the special effects are made in the 80s style. <br /> <br /> The film is almost as ugly as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So have fun! ;) (don't watch this movie)
