This film is probably the worst I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad stuff. It is interesting to compare it with two other films of the same genre and approximately the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seem more robust both in history and in directing and it is still Albert Pyun who also directed these two! <br /> <br /> the story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, probably due to an environmental disaster or nuclear war, and people live in medieval circumstances. A special race of robots (cyborgs) lives on human blood and there is history ... Cyborgs need many humans to fulfill the "prophecy" and humans need someone to stop them. A girl with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs was named by fate to save humanity. <br /> <br /> In this film the director tries out some elegant Hong Kong fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping away. The film fails miserably in this attempt. I recommend this movie with the only reason why many people will have a new movie "worse than ever" to relate to. And fans of the genre recommend "Cyborg" because I think it's a very underrated movie with a pretty high entertainment factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme, take a look at "Nemesis". <br /> <br /> I voted for this 1/10 movie.
