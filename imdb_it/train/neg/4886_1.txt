Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (still played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a psychiatric institution (even though she killed six people) and delivered to Hope Bartholomew's halfway house. Once there, she immediately falls into her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who stands between her and her food. <br /> <br /> HOLY MOLY! This movie sucks! You know you're in trouble when the open credits start and they're just the credits of the first movie, apparently filmed from a TV screen. Nick Millard (with his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to the world of Crazy Fat Ethel more than ten years later and on a budget that probably covered the cost of an empty tape and a weekend video camera rental. Let's just say that Millard's unique style doesn't translate well into videos. Seriously, I made home movies with a higher production value than this. And Millard tries to pull a SILENT NIGHT, MORTALLY NIGHT 2 absorbing half the running time with the filming of the first movie (which seems to have been taken from a consummate VHS copy). Alden is as good as Ethel again, but the film is so inept that he starts feeling sorry for her for starring in this garbage. I mean, at least the first film I tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if this is entirely possible), flickering camera work, horrible audio and editing that seems to be done with two connected video recorders. Avoid this at all costs!
