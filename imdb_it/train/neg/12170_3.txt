No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it is a much better idea to have it behind a camera than in front of one. Although this film is not without interesting elements (mullet from hell, etc.), it is overcome by defects. First, Angela, the killer counselor, seems to be about the same age as campers. Having an older and threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the crime scenes. The budget was apparently too low to perform most of them correctly (no pun), although drowning someone in an outdoor toilet is certainly original. But overall, there are a lot of movies out there that are scarier / more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching.
