The first movie is pretty good. This is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Recycle a lot of movies (including the opening credits and the final title) of Criminally Insane. The new video, shot on video, really stands out as badly done. The scenes lack adequate lighting, the sound is sometimes almost incomprehensible, there are also video problems like the moving image and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad sequels, in practice it simply repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills all those who share its living space, often for reasons that have to do with them hindering the food they want. <br /> <br /> At least it's just an extra on the DVD for the first, which also includes the same film by director Satan's Black Wedding. Too bad it doesn't include Death Nurse movies.
