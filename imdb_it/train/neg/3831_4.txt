I will have to disagree with the previous comment and stand with Maltin on this. This is a Western West, excessively vicious, that creaks and groans trying to compare its central theme of the Wild West, which is tamed and set aside for the constant march of time. He would like to be in the tradition of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", but lacks the intensity and charm of that film. Andrew McLaglen's leadership is lackluster, and the last 30 minutes or so is a real mess, with an incomprehensible strategy by the heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone gives me an answer if you can explain to me why they set fire to that hill.) There was something insensitive about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction later certainly didn't sound real. Coburn is very unpleasant while the half race has escaped from jail for revenge, but all its escape companions are underdeveloped (they are like pins to knock down one by one as the story goes forward). Michael Parks offers one of his typically elusive, lethargic and clumsy performances, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern sheriff style symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring.
