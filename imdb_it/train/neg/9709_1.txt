30 seconds in the opening credits, I had the feeling that this would be a bad movie, but I didn't know how bad it was. Then the actor who plays the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and I and my friend decide that in order to survive this film, we will have to lower the volume, create our dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But that didn't help. About halfway we turned it off. Now, I've experienced some very bad movies before, both with and without the help of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie", but there are only a few movies that I even doubt the Bots can save. The biggest part of the movie that bothered me most is that people hypnotized to believe that zombies had a decaying green skin. I imagine they were all hypnotized in death, then hypnotized to rot themselves. Follow the classics of the cult of the movie B as "Plan Nine From Outer Space".
