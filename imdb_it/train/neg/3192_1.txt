What the reviewers and MST3K have left is the best part (and only the memorable scene) of this otherwise terrible film: there is a very beautiful scene in the rape scene committed by the villain (Ben Gazzara look-alike) on Maria (as mentioned, killed later due to TJ's ineptitude). Perhaps rape is too strong a word, the "prison mating ritual" may be more appropriate. The background of this possibility, but the forced encounter is the mafioso who hides "Ben Gazzara", introduces him to the girls who pass by his pool. The blonde for 30 years dissects him, but our bad guy must be pretty impressed by her, because the courtship is at that time. His first move is to try to drown her, until his mafia benefactor tells him to drop him. A bit like the high school girl you didn't like, but still wanted to have carnal knowledge anyway ... Let's just say that, later, he will surprise her with her in the cabana.
