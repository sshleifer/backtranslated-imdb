Usually I talk a little bit about the plot in the first part of my review but in this movie there isn't really much to talk about. Just a mixture of other epic top FARs of sword and sorcery. Lack of cohesion is rampant like banality. Even the main woman who refuses to wear clothes other than a thong is rather boring since she has practically a young boy's chest. Funny in its ineptitude at best and seriously retarded at worst. Lucio Fulci was scrapping the bottom of the barrel here and showing. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Posters & Stills galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and US & International Theatrical trailers <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless for everything (some might consider it attractive, I don't); various extras are also topless
