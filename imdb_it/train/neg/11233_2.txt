As far as I can tell you, despite the previous comments published by other commentators, this film is currently available on DVD. I found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I paid the total total of 98 cents plus taxes for it. I found it in a shop of 98 cents between racks of plastic bowls and disposable wands. Now, aren't you the ones who paid a big dollar for the limited edition version imported from Swedish super-crooks, you feel like you were ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was really 98 cents worth. 99 cents, I could start arguing with you. But clearly it is worth 98 cents. And remember what you say you get what you pay for. Only for slasher film experts.
