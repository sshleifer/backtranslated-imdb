this, it is NOT one of those films it is one of the greatest tripe pieces I've ever seen, the camera work is trying to be flashy but in reality it sucks everything that looks like the diaries of the red shoe, but without sex, the only reason I bought it is that I wanted to try the DVD and this was the cheapest one I found, perhaps the worst purchase of my life and I might have put you out of DVDs forever, the soundtrack is REALLY sticky and most of the film is made up of endless repetitions of clips from the first two films, because someone would like to make a film as horrible as this is beyond me, if they had really tried to make an original film and failed I would have been more beautiful in this review but they have not only the right to reproduce things from the first two and then to modify them and repeat them in this film with about perhaps less than a third original movie that is up to the standards of the students of the film schools, DO NOT buy this movie. the only entertainment that this DVD can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER INCREDIBLE GARAGE! 0/10 if only the voting system allows it.
