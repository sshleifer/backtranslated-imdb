I was so excited when I found out that it was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like that CD of the rarities of your favorite band that you found in the back of the rack in your local music store. Being a hard core enthusiast, you were sure it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never managed to make a real album. This DVD is only recommended for "completists" who must have everything Lynch did. "Six Men Getting Sick" is visually interesting but short and repetitive. Missing the power of Lynch's next job "The Grandmother" is simply an immature job. It's boring and looks like a student movie. But it was the 70s ... It is interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can briefly see the seeds of some of his distinctive images and sounds. "The Alphabet" is forgettable (No indeed! I don't remember this at all!) "The amputee" is useless. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is simply silly. "Lumiere" is the only one worth joining the group. Without dialogue, Lynch tells a disturbing story comparable to his best work. I had to watch it several times. But it works less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth renting or buying the DVD.
