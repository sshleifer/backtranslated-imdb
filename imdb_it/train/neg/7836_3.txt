The first episode set the level high enough that I thought. He played William Hurt in the role of a hitman who was charged with killing a toymaker. We are given very little information about his character or who is paying him to kill, indeed the episode is noteworthy for not having dialogues. Returning to his modernist attic he is given a package containing soldiers, this makes him smile, but he dismisses him and does his business. But it's on a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and going to make war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show and gets quite tense as he wanders around the apartment using his intelligence to survive, sometimes taking over and sometimes not. I don't want to ruin the ending, but suffice it to say that it was a small smart turnaround. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all junk and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King's adaptations are always a mixture and these are no exception
