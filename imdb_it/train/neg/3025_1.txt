this movie is really bad ....... I don't mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible director. of all the films he has made, I only like the enemy of the state, he is also one of the worst directors of all time. what struck me most is Richard Kelly (the director of Donnie Darko) did the script to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but being involved in this gives hope that he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> I now love the new roles of Mickey Rourke, but I don't like him either because of the terrible story and appearance. Don't get me wrong, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he did a few accidents in his time and this is one of them. I don't know what to say about Keira horseman, I think he's a bit too overrated. I can't hear myself in the movies. <br /> <br /> all in all this movie is bad. this is ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
