I have rarely been bothered by a performance as important as Ali McGraw's in this film. God is she annoying or what ?! It all says in the same tone and it's horrible, so horrible that, on the contrary, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There isn't much history. He is rich, he is of wood, both must sacrifice a lot of love. His father is Stonewall Jackson, his is called by his name, in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they passed in the name of love. <br /> <br /> The Oscar nominations for this film indicate that it must have been a bad year. John Marley is fine as Wooden's father, but as a candidate? At least Ali didn't win. <br /> <br /> I still think Katharine Ross should have played Jennifer, but then again, if it was up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in many more movies. She is certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> I didn't even cry when she got sick, it never occurred to me to feel sad. <br /> <br /> It was good to see Tommy Lee Jones as about 15 years old and the score is good. But this is so old he now has a beard a mile long, and his sin is not so old, but he feels it.
