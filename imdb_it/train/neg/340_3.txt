I guess the reason this movie went so well at the box office is, of course, Eddie Murphy. I think this was his first Beverly Hills Cop movie so it was hot at the time. Considering that one has made over two hundred million and was R and this has made about 80 million and was pg says that it was not that popular. I've never been a big fan of Eddie Murphy, so this is probably another reason why I didn't care much. This has Eddie as a kind of seeker of lost children. He must find the golden child or the world is in terrible danger. The plot is bad, but bad as it is not comparable to special effects. I had seen better things done in the 1970s than some of the things that this offers, Ray Harryhausen has done better things. The main reason you see a movie like this is because of Eddie, unfortunately it's not very funny in this and it just seems stupid to put it in the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" scenes. I guess they were hoping for a fish with no water effect, but for me it didn't work.
