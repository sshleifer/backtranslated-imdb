This film commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film would have caused a stir among Cannes critics, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newcomer to get noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the theme of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, however). <br /> <br /> The metamorphosis of the main character from the good but problematic boy to the vicious rapist is practically non-existent, while the rape scene (being an excessively dragged and exaggerated version of the rape scene from "A clockwork orange") it is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things that an artist should not do to try to achieve his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To conclude: terribly brutal, revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. See "A clockwork orange" or "Le pianiste" instead.
