The film opens on Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood in his mouth, waiting where he is holding it, about two feet above him. It was so provocative and I thought, "Here, a good vampire movie!" <br /> <br /> And then he died. That was literally the only scene that captured every part of the imagination. From then on it was slow, without incident. I was very disappointed, as my previous experience with acting in Sands was quite pleasant. However, this attempt was obviously misplaced and the script left a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Even the questionable interpretation of Julian Sands cannot begin to save this already sunken movie barge. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 1.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
