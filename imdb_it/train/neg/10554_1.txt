An avant-garde nightmare film, extremely low budget, with delusions of grandeur. Difficult to sit. I get the message that child abuse is wrong. Wow, great revelation. I had no idea he was wrong before he saw it. Yes, it is sarcasm. DO NOT watch this "movie" if you are offended by the nudity of the male or female gender. DO NOT watch it if you are a little fussy. DO NOT watch it if you are interested in acting. Think twice don't look at it point. <br /> <br /> My assessment: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: film making, premiere, interview with Kristie Bowersock, deleted scenes, frames, director's comment, 2 versions of teaser trailer, music video of The Azoic and a video experiment in the classroom
