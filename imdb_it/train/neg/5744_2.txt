This film was horrible, simply put. It was so bad that I registered with IMDb to warn you of its dangers. <br /> <br /> I am an expert in field horror films, per se. I saw "Redneck Zombies", "House of the Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many others. I know my schlock. And I know this movie sucks. <br /> <br /> Three quarters of the film is made up of frightened individuals running from one side of the screen to the other. When they are not running, they are emitting non-sequitur lines, devoid of emotion or motivation. When the actors begin to be acceptable, the direction falls apart. There were so many cramped low-angle shots; I imagined that Leif Jonker had a three-meter-high tripod. He used what I call "Leif Maneuver" several times: that is, the zoom from an object of interest as an amateur. Apparently the crew failed to get up early enough to film a sunrise, so they filmed a sunset ... and they played it backwards. With the direction of this lazy, you are really impressed by the bloody final scene. The only thing you can imagine is that the last five minutes were shot before the first eighty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> If you want a good (bad) bloody movie, rent "Riki-Oh" or the founder "Dead alive." If you are a schlock fan and are looking for a challenge, give yourself "Darkness". <br /> <br /> Quote from the movie- <br /> <br /> Vampire: it's time!
