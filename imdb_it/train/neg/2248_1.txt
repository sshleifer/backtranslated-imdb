This film is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why anyone heard that the Garland / Mason version had to be redone, or why Striesand would be a first choice as a protagonist. <br /> <br /> For that matter, I have no idea why our people (gay Americans) largely tend to consider Striesand as a kind of treasure. At least in my opinion, he had reached the professional peak with Funny Girl and What's Up Doc by Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and rent the classic Judy, or even the original (a nice movie in its own right), but please, please, PLEASE skip this stink!
