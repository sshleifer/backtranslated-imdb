The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most writers. Fortunately, the acclaimed director Nelson McCormick gave us the second best volleyball film of all time (rated below Side Out and above, well, umm). However, don't let the cover of this movie decide you. Kill Shot greets the stars and the star Koji arrives as a modern Sherlock Holmes. Using these high-tech gadgets as a less powerful computer than my Gameboy, Koji is able to help FBI agents track down a man who has committed no obvious crime. While there are other actors in the film, including short cameos by Denise Richards, a gay black man and an absurdly ugly and annoying girl, Koji brings this movie alone. Any fan of films like The Matrix or Hackers will surely love Kill Shot.
