I have to say that this film is a Mork and Mindy that comes off, when I look at it I got the chills, I even got a little wet. When that Korean guy with spiders in the neck started kicking people, I was like my lord, Asian people smell and suck because they eat dogs all the time. Any way to get back on track, Chuck had a pretty terrible performance and didn't have the intelligence of a normal, non-robotic human being. Some people compared him to his early days when he was a car wash analyzer and he believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of the Christmas past. This movie is so bad that I put my newborn baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris's mailbox. Can raise my child I will not let him enter a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert. I will let him see what is what he hacks in real life for the rest of his life.
