This film is in no way entertainment but more of a deep look into the depths of the darker side of human behavior. He freely connects half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action takes place on some very hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna and the heat is perhaps responsible for part of the anger and hatred in the film. For me, the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman concerned the worst episode, followed closely by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the "slag" apartment. You will be grabbed and hopefully horrified by this movie. I hated it but felt obliged to see it through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to show 'man' as it sometimes is.
