The reasons to see this knock off ... err ... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's active while your channel is browsing and there's nothing else. - Someone pays you to watch it. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and pop into the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or insert it into your Netflix cue and skip The Flock completely. The Flock the same story with some changes. Furthermore, editing is just a Se7en trail and actually ends up taking you out of history several times. The worst is probably the flight over helicopters in the desert, with sounds of people chatting on the radio, except that there are no police helicopters flying over here. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: I call it an obvious disconnect. If you want to be nice you can call it a tribute movie, go ahead, but in any case go see Se7en.
