Well, I had to sit at the computer and write the review immediately after seeing this puddle of slime. Why? Because I have to let you all know how bad this movie is. It's incredibly bad. To make you understand how bad it is, I will offer this little detail about the film. During the chaos scenes, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, video game scenes are exchanged. Yes, you heard me right. This movie really sucks. In fact, it makes me think of the fact that these days it costs ten dollars just to enter the cinema these days. And see the shit full of corn like this? There is no story to talk about and the film has virtually nothing to offer but the occasional head-to-head and really cheap kills. I'm really disappointed with this, knowing I saw it. OK, I'm stunned. It's so bad that I can't even find the words. RATING: ZERO of *****.
