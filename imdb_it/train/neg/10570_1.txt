Don't be fooled by the MPAA with their "Rated R for extreme violence", there is absolutely no extreme violence in this boring s * t problem. I was expecting some rambo 3 economic action that the trailer promised, however it is a boring and boring bore with tons of slow flashback blades that make no sense. TO AVOID!
