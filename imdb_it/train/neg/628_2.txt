This film has the potential to be a decent horror movie. The main character was decently done and I felt sorry for him and there was a fair amount of backstory. HOWEVER, everything else sucks. The director, Emmanuel, is rather incompetent in filming. Use some of the most idiotic shots ever. <br /> <br /> - a couple of random sequences of random images scattered throughout the film. I don't know if he tried to be profound, intelligent and poetic, but he wasn't. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer in which the main character lived, random buildings, random twists of buildings, random cats moving away. WTF? And clouds A lot of dark gloomy clouds. <br /> <br /> - he really liked this technique of having a scene cut out in different shots rather than just being a continuous shot. EX: Guy is trying to light his grass and the camera moves around him. Instead of a single shot, change it into 10 different shots, so it's really EDGE! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible but that's what makes the movie so fun. And the scarecrow is a gymnast, because he turns and turns and spins continuously. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main bully to have a long death well built but no. A simple cob in the ear. Love interest was hot. Voluptuous. This is why this film gets a 2.
