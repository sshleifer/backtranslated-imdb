Being a film graduate, I'd like to think I've seen a wide range of movies, some good ones and some bad ones, but I should say that "Summer rain" is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it would be a great British classic like "Secrets and Lies" or "Lockstock" but oh no, this was so bad that my roommates and I ended up laughing and laughing for the ridiculous acting and a malicious script (it reminded me of a bad school production of "theater in education"). The main characters Michelle and Gary started to bother us from the beginning. 'Michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has the kind of face you will never get tired of banging and Gary was so wet (he continued to burst into tears every 5 minutes) that at the end of the movie I really don't care none of them. All I could think of was "I paid Â£ 3 for this pile". I have never written a review before, but after watching this film it spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. So please avoid at all costs. Thanks for reading.
