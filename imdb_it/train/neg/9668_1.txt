1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by a German cameraman with the naive cooperation of the Jewish community, is combined with archive footage, international newsreel clips and extracts from related cultural films to portray the Jews of the world as scammers and parasites. This "documentary" interprets Jewish life from the point of view of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A candid and cinematically unique expression of racial hatred. I personally find this film scary and highly offensive. One can only hope that images like this will never come to the screen again.
