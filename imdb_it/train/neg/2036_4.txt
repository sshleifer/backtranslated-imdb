The film is about a young man, Michael, who takes care of the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his clients' relatives. At the same time he decided to model his killing after the Zodiac Killer of the 60s. He gets in touch with the author of a book on the Zodiac Killer and forms a friendship. Michael has a gun (except for the one pistol, since it appears to be in the hands of some of the other actors, only not portrayed as the same gun.) Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B's films. I thought the idea of ​​the film was good, but editing and acting really drowned the plot. I thought the "blood" was too fake, the lighting was horrible in some places and the dialogue was too standard. The film was shot on video, which is ok, but the editing of the film was made only for some strange scenes of "Plan 9". It's not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something a little more polished, move on to something else.
