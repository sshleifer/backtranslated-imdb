And so the great rewriting of history continues the Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This was a ridiculous nonsense nonsense. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that such a large amount of money can be spent to produce what is the artificial, artificial and misinterpreted film I have ever seen. It's scary. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's brief flirtation with serious acting seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a technical problem in a litany of terrible movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance at Troy was not a fluke, she can't really act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on this tripe. <br /> <br /> Recommended only to those who are recovering from a recent lobotomy or people who think that America invented the world.
