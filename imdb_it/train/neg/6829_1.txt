I've written at least half a dozen fierce reviews of this little abysmal movie and no one is published, so I have to say that someone at imdb.com really likes this horrible movie. The idea that a group of oilmen can resurrect a military tank that is set in the desert for over a decade, and becoming a combat machine again is ridiculous. So is acting and direction. Roll over.
