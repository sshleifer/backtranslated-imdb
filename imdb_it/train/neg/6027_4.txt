I grew up a Baptist and I know the story that this film is trying to tell, even though I no longer believe in history. I will compliment the movies for being as good as the average Lifetime movie of the week. Interpretation moderately interesting, mediocre, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is mushy, and a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind must be the most squalid non-Christian clean, ever. Not a single word curse from any of them. But I laughed loudly when the actor who plays the man who directs the United Nations declared "nuclear" as "nu-cu-ler", just like Bush. Is there a Christian code of honor that requires that, since Bush says that he too is called by God, all Christians must cover up his ignorance by utterly pronouncing that word the same way he does it? LOL! I really had trouble resuming the film seriously after all this. After the "nu-cu-ler" incident, the film began to look like a packaged and manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that could make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for unreasonable entertainment, stop here - it's good for killing a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
