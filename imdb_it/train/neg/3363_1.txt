The original film (dated 19 ??) showed no "monster", but SUGGESTS "scary" things. <br /> <br /> This version however shows every aspect of a "sick ghost", including useless special effects. <br /> <br /> The "mystery", as presented in the original film, was the scariest part: one simply didn't know what was causing the strange things that happened. Showing the face of the "old man", this gentleman has completely disappeared. Even worse: the special effects (crying faces of children in wood) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, too obviously spectacular to be near as scary as the original
