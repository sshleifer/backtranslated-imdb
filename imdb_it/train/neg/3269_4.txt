With the exception of Meryl Streep, who is always known, I would avoid this film because it has a "Movie of the Week" quality dated in this regard. But it is worth looking at if you keep in mind the different intents: how a couple bears the examination of the media and how the different are treated. <br /> <br /> In the film the problem is the credibility of the different. Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) get there automatically with an air of "strangeness" about them. The couple involved is religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventist (different). So their lifestyle and their mentality are suspect to begin with. Dinghies are different animals from other dogs, so we are again faced with problems of strangeness. The real story, therefore, is how society (and the world) treats different people, those who have different accents, different beliefs, about us and how we treat what they say suspect. <br /> <br /> It's hard to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" without laughing and there are humorous posts, unfortunately, all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the film was discovered (as you will find in web searches) that much older children were persecuted by the dingos. Research conducted by experts in dingos showed that it was not only possible but also very probable that the child had been taken by dingos (perhaps a couple), expertly extracted from clothes and eaten in a few moments without leaving a trace. <br /> <br /> What remains is the question as to why people defended the dingos when they were found to endanger children rather than kill the dingo to save children, because, because affection (expression ) of a woman is so cold, it is assumed to be guilty, and so on. <br /> <br /> Disturbing questions, with or without the film.
