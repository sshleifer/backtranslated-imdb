There is no way to go around it: this film is terrible. I've seen the old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I'm familiar with the characters and their serial origins, but it's still just crazy. However, the genius of Peter Sellers still shines with his portrait of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy and strength that boil through a stoic facade; it's a performance that I put on a par with Peter Cushing's portrait of Van Helsing, but made in a tenth of the cumulative screen of all of Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the film had been made in a more seriously comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP through the AVENGERS '60s TV show, this could have been something special. If you are a more complete Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for anyone else.
