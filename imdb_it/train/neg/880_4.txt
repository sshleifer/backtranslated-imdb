Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at the "modern day" of Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first work as a director since the 1940s! David Janssen is a little awkward as a large casino owner who rejoins his son (Robert Drivas, who looks as baffling as an old Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches each scene in the same way: on the defensive, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role in fashion and calm is to ask too much of Janssen, who barks at all like an ugly rotten husband (he even chews Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a newborn looking for his own identity, makes fashionable comments about how young people look down on Vegas (they give him another ten years), and his disapproval of dad's lifestyle causes frictions. Brenda Vaccaro is pretty like a conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a bit of fun like a showgirl in an audition. Unfortunately, "Where It's At" has little more to do than the horrible speculations about ethics among adults and children, some quick T & A shots and funny and witty satirical bits about the world of high-stakes gambling-- most of which has been covered up now, to the point of nausea. ** from ****
