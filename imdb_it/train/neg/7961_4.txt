Five years after the original Creepshow, another lower-level horror sequel is signed by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is truly original or distinct. The first story is a staple of horror, a terrific story about an Indian wooden statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really accurate in this story, but it's too familiar to be convincing enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the old shop owners. The second story, "The Raft", is a story by Stephen King. There are about four teenagers who unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the children are screaming for their lives as a watery blob lets each of them enter for no apparent reason. However, instead of having a sense of suspense, the children are afflicted by bad dialogue and head-on behavior, which prevents us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some involuntary humor in this segment. The third and final story is "The Hitch-hiker", which is actually a rebuilt re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was shot in 1953 as a suspense noir movie. Then it was adapted for an episode of Twilight Zone with Inger Stevens. "The Hitch-hiker" offers the best from these three offers, but is not without its problems. Lois Chiles plays a traitorous wife, who ends up running on a hitchhiker, or so she thinks. However, we do not know whether to sympathize with or condemn her. As in many average stories of this type, the characters simply exist to tell the stories with their twists. The enveloping story with bullies seems a little out of place. Tom Savini looks like the "creep" in this episode. The good thing is that there have been no other sequels. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
