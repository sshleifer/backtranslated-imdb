When I caught a glimpse of the title, I thought we would get another tough slogan, but in reality I found "7eventy 5ive" a moderately passable pastime and almost 80s, after a boring intermediate part that takes the momentum for the last half now that leads to his outrageously disproportionate climax and at the end of the policeman. He will not win prizes for originality, because it is systematic how one can get and steal his thunder in terms of chills (usual economic scares), position (secluded villa) and motivation from other films. The glittering direction is textbook and the material is rather trivial with false falsifications in its elaborate elaboration and inconsistent script. At times ridiculous, but nevertheless I was entertained mainly because of his brutal and horrible acts of pulpy violence towards some university students rather hatefully annoying from a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances weren't bad in the form of a young spunky cast, but the characters they were portraying weren't particularly appealing. An ever presentable Rutger Hauer appears in a brief supporting role as a grizzled detective. A slickly product, but a superficial and forgettable addition.
