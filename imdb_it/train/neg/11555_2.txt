A great slasher film - sin was the producers and they were not part of the script. Summary of the basic plot: the man with the red fetish goes to invite these women into his apartment only to get into a kind of bizarre coma and proceed with offing to various degrees of success. Only the back cut band must have thought the movie was advertised like me and cut the hell out of the movie. Nothing flows, you miss out on which red is at that moment (didn't do it before ??), and most of the time it seems that the camera man fainted and resumed shooting when he woke up. Not that I can blame him I fainted 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain that little story that exists. Attention when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with something that happens before - you will only get an aneurysm. It's not worth the time, the effort, or God doesn't want money. Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the subtle chance that hacking occurred between the release of the movie and the horrible version I saw.
