... yet, we were told, there was still an hour and 20 minutes to go. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer / director to take it, snip, cut? Apparently the writer / director has already made short films; in short, this would have been fine. But the lack of dialogue begins to grate after twenty minutes. The lack of much music shines. The background noises (talking, traffic and above all a ubiquitous helicopter) age very quickly. But the worst failure is in history. There is little more than a brief. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw the same scene over and over again. I almost screamed at the screen "We understand, we understand it !!!!!" It's amazing that after we left the theater, we could go home, watch the Daily Show and share in the Colbert Report, prepare to go to bed and know that the audience was STILL trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to indulge your vision. You have to give the public enough to share your vision.
