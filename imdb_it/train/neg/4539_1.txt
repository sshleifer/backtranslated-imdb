I've never seen anything as terrible as this movie in a while. The film was a boring, long and terrible plot. Special effects suck - It's like watching a movie in 1999. It's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time. Matthew Settle's performance was pretty bad. I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt.Speirs, he wasn't so bad. In fact it is not bad at all. But in this film, his acting wasn't convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry among the rest of the crew. Besides, his eyes seem empty as if he didn't hear them. He really surprised me, because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> However, he doesn't even bother watching this movie. It's a big and GREAT waste of time. Even if you kill an hour or two, do something else besides watch this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!
