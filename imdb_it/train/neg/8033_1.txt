In a college dorm a boy is killed by someone with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) finds out and attempts to commit suicide. It is institutionalized. A year later he is out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a large, beautiful condominium in Florida. Obviously the killer appears (without reason) and starts killing again. <br /> <br /> Bad thriller thriller - a textbook example of how NOT to make a low-budget horror movie. For beginners, great parts of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots who recover, having fun (more fun than the public), getting drunk, acting stupid and so on. Also, there is NO ONE in here. I'm not saying that a horror movie needs nudity, but SOMETHING to revive it would have helped. None of the deaths are actually shown (you can hear them), I'm just a little bloody and there's no blood. There's a real creepy - but it's not until the end. <br /> <br /> With few exceptions, acting sucks. Dorie Barton is as terrible as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is as lousy as Oz. Chad Allen looks like Brad and is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good - handsome and big and giving all these crap. And Jeff Conaway appears in a small role doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Logicians fail - after they realize that a friend has been killed, two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non-reaction to seeing a friend being killed is pretty funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace at the end! Boring, stupid, bloodless, without nudity: skip this.
