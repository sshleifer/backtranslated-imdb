Unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there is nothing to ruin in that movie. Although B. Mattei had never done a masterpiece he used to do his job with a bit of humor and madness, this made him a fun director of Eurotrash. But in the last 10 years he seemed to have lost it. This film is just empty, not at all to wake us from the deep sleep you sink into after the first 10 minutes. No sex, no blood (is it supposed to be snuff?), No actors, no dialogue, just like a 90'TV movie. It's even worse than his last cannibal and zombie epics. Rest in peace Bruno, you will remain in our minds forever, thanks to this unforgettable gems such as: Zombies 3, Robowar, Rats, the other hell, Viruses, cruel jaws and few others. So, except if you want to see B Mattei owned by Franco's new film, Franco's spirit passes over this. But if you don't, I know that this beautiful artisan career traces his old movies and has fun.
