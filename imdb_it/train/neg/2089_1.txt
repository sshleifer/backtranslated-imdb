Of course I was watching BG. I loved S1, I liked the second season, the third season was fine and I liked the final one. Yes, there is a spin-off show! I didn't know at all, one of my friends told me about this. I was really excited. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 3 episodes ... What a piece of garbage! Teenage drama fest. There is no science fiction ... well, almost none. At the end of each episode we can see a Cylon. That's all. Who cares about this? Have they decided that the target audience for the next show will be females under the age of 18? Boring religious absurdities that speak, complain, complain ... and more. <br /> <br /> It's just sad that there's nothing at the moment to watch. Stargate in ruins, BG above ...
