I didn't understand this movie ... Was it a musical? no ... but there were choreographed songs and you danced inside ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama .... no acting wasn't good enough for that. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is a serious and quality actor ... Not really. <br /> <br /> I had trouble staying awake through this rambling movie. The message on apartheid and the "tribute" to the students who died during a student revolt is noted. But for entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style film it was worse. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but in all honesty I hated it
