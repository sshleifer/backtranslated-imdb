I happened to buy one of those collections of "Legacy of Horror" movie packages 50 and believe that I'm still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie. Sometimes you find a funny but campy one like The Devil's Messenger or The Devil Bat, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's great movies (some are not horror and they're just there because Hitchcock has directed horrors and suspense) but other times it seems they stage movies like The Island Monster and this because they can't accept the fact that they would be easily forgotten and should be. <br /> <br /> So let's open up some sort of Westing game idea. The father, rich but cruel and violent, played by Carradine (the main character of this) died and left his legacy to his sons and servants he still hates. Carradine gives a pretty good performance as always, but it remained mainly in a vocal recording and flashback sequences that let us go through mediocre / terrible performances. The rest of the cast overlooks or subtracts scenes. Since this was an independent film from the 1970s, lighting and effects are rather limited. It's hard to create a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's going on so well in some scenes. Some actors like servants Igor and Elga give at least an effort and I am ashamed to admit that he let me giggle at the end mainly due to sheer stupidity, but with still some small happiness that they pulled a version of a turn to an otherwise enough obvious who-made-but not enough to improve the quality of the film. You are not destined to love the characters because they are selfish, cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. The death scenes are pretty ugly and the suspense isn't really there. Show that you will probably enjoy the 20 "Chilling" movie containing films like House on a Haunted Hill, Little Shop of horror with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead. This is best avoided.
