This film is simply terrible !!!! Slow action, slow to reach the point and wooden characters that should not have been there. The best part was the screening of Iron Maiden singing in some videos of a theater and that's it. the ending was worth watching and waiting for, but that was all! The characters in this film almost put me to sleep. Avoid it !!!
