I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting. I never had to read this book (thankfully), or it would have been a painful experience. I got the preview tickets for free, but it wasn't worth my time yet, or my friend. I think this story is not worth telling. It's like saying that old people have a past before they became old (no jokes). The lives of the main characters were painful to watch, a generation not better than the next to avoid stupid mistakes. However, I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story. I've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn. I'm writing this review to counter the positive reviews, which unfortunately convinced me to try this movie.
