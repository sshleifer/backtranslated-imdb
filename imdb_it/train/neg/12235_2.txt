If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you will also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my comments on My Girl 1 as a reference). Indulgent admission: I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance, having just seen its predecessor. But as an adoptive who is preparing to finally look for my mother, My Girl 2 made me look, with the theme of her mother's research. <br /> <br /> In another way, everything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing to do with My Girl 2, but related to a protagonist who asks, like so many adopted ones, "who is my mother" ? And if there are my mom's home movies in an acting company, I'll be sure to make my movie about it. <br /> <br /> People are listless. Movies should not be listless. My Girl 2 (like My Girl 1) is just ... listless. <br /> <br /> Avoid unless you are a complete lymphoma that is comforted by a series of minor annoyances.
