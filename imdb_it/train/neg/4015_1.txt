a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like "Debbie makes Dallas". Nowhere near. I think my main complaint is about the less attractive actress in the porn industry than ever. Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere that in those days porn had to have an "artistic" value. I couldn't find it though. Look at it only if you are interested in the history of porn development in the mainstream, or you can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I'm not. But the film's director seems to be a talented person. He also tried to convince Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course, they rejected.
