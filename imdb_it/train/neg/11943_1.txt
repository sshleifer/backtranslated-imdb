The scenery is nice and the dog is cute. In addition to this, this film has absolutely nothing to recommend. Jack Warden is pleasantly brilliant as usual, but the script is so terrible that even he gets it wrong. The plot doesn't make sense, the dialogue is stupid and there are numerous small mistakes. But the dog is cute ...
