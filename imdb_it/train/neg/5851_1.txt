I doubt that Jigsaw was even hip at the time, the whole subject of LSD married to a mysterious murder was a clear evident attempt to capture a young audience of the time without showing the slightest understanding of the counterculture of the sixties. The aspect dated apart, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including excessive acting, foolish and drafted dialogue, LSD flashbacks that continue interminably long even after the point was hammered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create a real suspense even if the real plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trivial and predictable (not to mention many bad television programs) that the climax is actually an anti-climax . If it were a better film, we might be able to suspend disbelief on some things where fun would help, but the weaknesses are so obvious that they only serve to highlight the improbabilities that viewers might otherwise overlook. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely a late-night television tariff intended to fill the airspace and pass the time to kill someone's insomnia rather than anything else he should actively seek. At best, a three out of 10.
