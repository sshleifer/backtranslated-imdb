As others have noted, this should have been an excellent Hammer-style film, and it seems to me that this is how most of the actors were trained to play it ... but the script is so leaden, unbalanced and full of many soliloquies dull (poor Timothy Dalton is fascinated by most of them) which is far too exaggerated and self-important. This is an unusually weak performance by Dalton, although he quietly nails the climate scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he did. The only actor that comes out really well is Patrick Stewart, which is a very welcome show. Freddie Francis may have been a great filmmaker, but he was a bad director.
