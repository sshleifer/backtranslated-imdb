"Cut" is a film about some film students who make a film. It is very much in the mold of "Scream", an ironic and self-referential horror film that, at least for me, falls because, despite all its irony, it's just a bad horror movie, the same as the movies it refers to. br /> <br /> But it was not without its charm. Well, a charm anyway. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as an American actress, frowning and bitchy, who hates every minute of work with the Australian film crew. She was so convincing that she was tempted to believe that it wasn't an act, although everyone involved in "Cut" said it was lovely to work with him. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, every scene of his sulking or pouting was fantastic. All the others, however, swayed between being OK and being terribly wooden. <br /> <br /> However, "Cut" has some laughter, some buckets of blood (some of them surprisingly gruesome), and in the end it's just another bad horror movie.
