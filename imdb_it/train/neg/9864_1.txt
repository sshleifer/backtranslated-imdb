As a player, I can't say I like this movie. The fact is that, rightly, I hate it. I tried to look at it as openly as possible, but when it comes to this, I feel rather insulting to my social group. <br /> <br /> For me, there are several reasons why. <br /> <br /> 1. The characters seem unnatural. I met many players, from all the different paths of life. I don't know anyone who behaves like one of the characters in the movie. It is as if the film producers took the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most players are rather social people, some with quite active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The mockumentary style is not suited to the subject of the film. A real documentary about players would really work better. While it is beautiful (I.E. clean together), it is not very good. <br /> <br /> 3. Dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. Players swear, I admit, but we don't have Tourette syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. Humor is lacking. While self-deprecating humor is the cornerstone of my group and many other groups I have met, this is less self-deprecating and more like toilet humor. Likewise, much of the players' humor is full of jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most players oppose it and avoid anyone who has made similar jokes. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest problem for me is basically this: Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but rather dynamic. Invariably, this film will be compared to even lower budget films, The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, which portray both players as real people playing in a real game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat senseless players against The Gamers, where you can say something like, "Huh, I know a guy like that ... Yes, he's definitely like Gary. "
