First things first: I'm not a conservative. And although I would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat, I was against the war in Iraq from day one. I think it's safe to say John Cusack and I will probably see things clearly, in fact, I'm sure we would have become drinking buddies if we ever got to talk about the great BBC documents of Adam Curtis. My point is this: do not discredit this review thinking of not being part of the chorus that Cusack is preaching in War, Inc. There is no doubt that WI's policy is tailored to attract my demographic, but the problem is that the tailoring is poor and the film that Cusack co-wrote, produced and interpreted, fits worse than a cheap suit. <br /> <br /> As they say "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". Cusack, his co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an equally biting and funny anti-war film by Robert Altman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with a shy and unintelligent as Michael Moore's Canadian bacon. <br /> <br /> The current state of American politics, foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and, consequently, tragic, pathetic and, unfortunately, comical - just look at The Daily Show and see for yourself . The bottom line is: you can't write such funny stuff as what the Bush administration provides us with every day, so why try to compete? <br /> <br /> The main problem with WI is that it feels like it was being put together quickly. To make it, Cusack basically cannibalized Grosse Pointe Blank (one of his best films), changed the picture and amassed a list of purchases of ideas raised by Naomi Klein's collected works. Most of these ideas get thrown in your throat in the first twenty minutes of the movie and what makes them so hateful is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to Halliburton, Neo-Cons and the US occupation of Iraq , they are imaginative, intelligent or funny. The writers are so blinded by their "dogma" that they felt that simply referring to these themes the film would be fun and subversive. The problem is ... it is not. By now these ideas are yesterday's news and if you have not lived under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and pure stupidity (read: a right-wing Christian), these jokes are simply insulting. <br /> <br /> Maybe WI would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed searches / insights on Employment. As it is, the jokes and the gags of sight are all superficial and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did little more than make me moan. Homer Simpson once said "It's funny because it's true" and The Daily Show proves it every night; War, Inc. however shows that just because it's true doesn't make it fun. The bottom line: hyperbole is not necessary when talking about US / neoconservative lampooning ... it's already a pretty big joke. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
