The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major films and really began to make a name for itself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the audience enjoyed most here. Two of these things sang and danced. Another was a short and interesting film that kept people's attention and kept their minds away from the Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's hit movies. <br /> <br /> This film did not achieve any of the above, despite the stellar appearances of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a great director on Henry Hathaway. Also, there are too many spoken parts here that become simply boring, and too many arguments between a gloomy Lombard and Cooper. Finally, you did not get the normal wellness ending that is what the public wants. I think they learned after this movie.
