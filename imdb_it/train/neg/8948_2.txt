'Ninteen Eighty-Four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and nobody can trust it. It's a very dark film, and it's one that won't make you feel good about yourself. It is a love story that takes place in this society and the betrayal of lovers and of human nature that has centered on itself. The film has some excellent ideas and is well done in portraying this society with dark colors (in contrast to happiness and bright colors in dreams) and a general feeling of solitude through objects, people and places. However, despite the film's intelligence in portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to have had enough of the idea. He seemed to spend too much time being smart rather than telling a story.
