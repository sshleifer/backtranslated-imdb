A cursed maniac with cannibal tendencies astonishes a woman. He was shot by two policemen and then rose from the grave due to a sort of satanic ceremonial rite preformed by an evil heresy. The hunt for women continues with this zombie demon. The sacrificed child returns from the grave and wants the dead maniac again, but only with the help of the police this will come true ... <br /> <br /> A damned 65-minute mess ... Horny zombies, doll - babbia, S & M, corrupt and twisted policemen, repentant heretics seeking refuge in front of Jesus Christ and three text screens at the end of the film explaining what happened to the cop who survived (yes, we should know!) ... Two decent guttings cannot save the situation. I saw the worst horror movies, but even that was pretty bad. Recommended only for fans of the genre.
