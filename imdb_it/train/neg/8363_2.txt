I gave a 2 instead of a 1 because I think "The Wild Women of Wongo" is worse. This is a patience exercise. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. There is certainly no acting (even if the shark has a quality dialogue). We don't ask for anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It's always surprising to me how things like that are released. I agree with the previous writer that it's not even funny. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and will fill all the space of a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad picture you bought in a sale of hungry artists. Cover the crack in the wall.
