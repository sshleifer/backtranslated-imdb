Hollow point is a film suitable for a half price rental or if nothing else is in a good time without worries. There are the necessary explosions and acting at the Amazon and beautiful women. A pretty good cast with Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and the beautiful Tia Carrere. This cast and a light touch make a film not great but fun ... scale from one to ten .. to 4
