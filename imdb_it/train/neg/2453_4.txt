I could have given this film a higher score before the Peter Jackson trilogy came out, but seeing them side by side there's no comparison. The pace of this film is rushed, many important scenes from the book are overlooked, and there is little character development. Animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that have been painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this film is that it stops in the middle of the story and has never been completed. There are some positive points: the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book practically to the letter. Watch this if you're in a hurry and you can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy. But if you haven't read the book you will probably be confused, because it is missing from this version. 4 out of 10.
