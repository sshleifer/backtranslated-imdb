GENERAL PERFORMANCES: - Finally the long waiting AAG hits the screens. Unfortunately, it was not possible to give progressive fire to the public. The first best thing to talk about the film is the idea of ​​remaking the powerful SHOLAY. And Varma has made a good choice to change the total background of the film. If he repeated the same background as Ramghad, people will say again that there is nothing new in this. A different background is grateful, but the way he presented it is not worthy. From the beginning of his career with SIVA in Telugu, he had used the same lighting and the same background. I don't really think about this guy that Varma considers enlightenment or not or he might not have other lighting techniques than Gordon Willis GODFATHER. It's all DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Because a certain body should use so many Dutch corners and extreme shots in the foreground !!!!!!! The division of the blows is lame. The characters couldn't stand an emotion, the performances are not in their sign, Storytelling is worse, Background is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz was too careful about his work. VARMA has produced great villains like Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai but this time he failed to sculpt the best characters of all time in Hindi cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbar and Babban. Babban is more of a psycho than a bad guy, yet he has a soft corner for his brother (it's a gift in this film). Amitabhz's performance is not in his sign. Its very appearance is pathetic. The scar on the nose symbolizes the forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What ever worked on Babban is unsuccessful. Babban has no comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to put the audience on hold for his hands. If varma did it, it would be like teaching the ABCD to a degree holder. Itz well opened the secret soon. But the flashback is pathetic. Varma could not use a great actor like mohanlal in his brand. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only character with improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and has been used based on the story. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body disturbs or at least considers this character. The film's absolute failure begins when the director cannot work on the close friendship between our hero. These characters bring nothing to this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG can be totally considered as a class C movie. Sholay is a fire of revenge, a problem of a city, which means true friendship and much appreciated nuisance and enjoyment by Dharmendra. AAG has never had an emotion with his characters. The narrative is too weak not to make the public feel sympathetic to the characters. Don't compare AAG with sholay, but you won't like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
