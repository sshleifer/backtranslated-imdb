I agree with most Columbo fans that this film was an unnecessary format change. Columbo is a single policeman with unorthodox police methods. This film looks like a remake of any other normal police drama of the past. And this is the disturbing point, because Columbo is not a normal detective. <br /> <br /> There are two parts to this film that left me intriguing. First of all, I can't understand the title of this film. It is misleading. Perhaps the best title would have been "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Second, Columbo hides a trial without offering reason (at least to the spectators) because it does so. <br /> <br /> I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed. I'm glad that Peter Falk came back to the usual Columbo. <br /> <br />
