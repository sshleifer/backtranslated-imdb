This is one of those movies that you see in the video store that you just have to take because it looks so terribly bad. And indeed, we couldn't handle most of it. There was a lot of fast shipping going on. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene in which Robert Englund seduces the female lead (his name somehow makes me lose my head right now). Cripes. I've never seen a single scene in a movie so many times (I value about forty or so). And I've never laughed so much in my life. See, Englund has this thing to show his loins. I last saw the movie a couple of months ago, but I can't stop laughing as I write. However, the scene is a montage of shots - Englund tearing up the girl's underwear, Englund riding a naked horse, and a mysterious woman striking a snake's head. This is an absolute genius. You must see it for yourself.
