OK ... I watch a lot of bad movies. I am proud of this fact. many times there are some gems in the bombs classified B. But this film is one of the worst I've seen. I like a good horror movie ... but one with a plot and a sense of movement. The opening scenes looked pretty good. Decent music and images. Then he goes down a hill. One of the main characters has a disability (ringing in the ears called tinnitus). Now this in turn threatens to reveal his secret. They made it too focused on the film. So the one that has ringed in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where it shouldn't have been. No need to keep pulling it up. So this guy has an affair with this girl and in a motel he falls and hits his head on the table. So instead of letting everyone know about his relationship, he decides to discharge the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well, after seeing her sister over and over again (like a zombie like a ghost) and even pointing directly to the position of the body, she finally finds it. Now the body is recovered and she is ready to face the only suspicion that killed her. The bad thing is that he didn't have much of a plan. Just to pretend to be her twin and meet the guy where the body was dumped. The idiot didn't even believe that he had killed her. So everything is revealed there and even if he had a gun ... somehow he manages to get strangled. So the last scenes in the film are "spirits" of her and her twin that come out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this film that the bad guy wins. And not one but two innocent people die. <br /> <br /> Positive things from the film: images <br /> <br /> Negative things from the film: long musical sound effects pulled out of the wrong direction of the plot by some not all actors
