Normally, I'm a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film I have to say that it was incredibly bad. I'm amazed at how much most reviews seem to be positive. <br /> <br /> There have been some wonderful shots, but it is a pity that they were wasted in this movie sink. It could have worked if "Daggers" was purely an action film and not a love story, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between the two couples, whatever exists between Mei and his men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is simply silly. This could only be a problem with translation, but the frequent use of the word "flirt" in particular reminded me of the eighth grade, not the butt, together forever, worth dying for love; I also felt I was overwhelmed by the head with the wind metaphor. The public is given very little about the characters to worry about, and therefore a very small emotional investment in the film as a whole. I wanted a remote control to go on fast, I was slumped on my seat ready to snore, but mostly I just trembled. <br /> <br /> ******* spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> Now, the icing on the cake. Or rather, adding insult to injury. The ending was really one of the most horrible and laughable I've ever seen. The boys are fighting their bachelor party and screaming and screaming and hacking at each other. Oh, and then it starts to snow. Random. Oh, and then Mei (the dagger embedded in the heart) suddenly opens up from the weeds. Then he throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach the destination, also slowing down the midscreen screen to hit a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Well, then Mei dies at the end, I guess because he threw the dagger that had been stuck in his chest and bled to death. Jin sings, sobs, holds his body close, the screen turns off. Me and the people around me laugh. It is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.
