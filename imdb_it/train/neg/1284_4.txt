This film was a long development without climax. People who refer to the sword fight, in the end, so big must be out of their minds or not. Too often this film has become soft. I'm not saying that soft movies are bad. But no matter how much you love sugar, you should not have room on a steak with bone. This film should have been revenge for the crimes committed against a culture, but in the end it was a petty bar fight. And there was only one of them who really knew what a sword was; The character of Tim Roth (and yes, he plays it well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero" with no knowledge of how to use a sword, and the way he "won" was a disgrace. As a drama, this film has its periods, but the best interpretation must be the nature of Scotland. This is short of being called "soap" in my book.
