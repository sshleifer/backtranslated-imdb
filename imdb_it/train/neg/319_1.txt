A friend of mine bought this film for Â£ 1, and even then it was overly expensive. Despite having big names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this film was almost as fun as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through the ear hole. He uses tired comic techniques at the bottom of the barrel - constantly breaking the fourth wall while Sandler speaks to the public, and seemingly useless montages of "sexy girls". <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to become a successful comedian to succeed with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shamelessly named "Dickie" due to his unfathomable success with the opposite genre - is presumed lost at sea, the Sandler Shecker character gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he is rather locked in the bathroom, presumably sick of the sea. <br /> <br /> Maybe from his mouth he just threw up the worst movie of all time.
