boring stuff we got here. His 5-minute shorts are better than this. know why? because there are only 5 minutes and not 91 minutes or how long this is long. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit ... eh .. the last half hour is fine the rest is boring and not fun = (I had second thoughts, the trailer made me look funny but the pace of this the film is rather slow and sadly not funny. Only boring boring klaymen we meet and we try to make us laugh .. it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Maybe next time, knox. <br /> <br / > Maybe re-cutting this movie and adding better scenes would be very healing but for now it's not good.
