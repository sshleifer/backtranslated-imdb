This film is not just a bad movie, with terrible actors - or supposed actors -, a bored direction and an unattractive story, it also copies exactly a scene from the excellent "giallio" "Torso", directed by Sergio Martino in 1973 (two years before), one of the most celebrated psycho-thrillers of Italian cinema and a cult movie worldwide. In "La Sanguinusa leads the dance", the director repeats the scene of the bed between the black girl and the white girl, with a voyeur who looks out of a bedroom window. Of course, the scene of Rizzo's film is ridiculous and inferior to the softness and charm of Martino's film. Putting another black girl, another white girl and another peeping-tom reproducing the scene is simply the most appropriate way to show that Rizzo's film has no ideas, originality, taste and nothing at all. I think things like that are offensive to the viewer.
