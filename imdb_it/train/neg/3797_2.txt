The years have passed since Alex Rain (played by Olivier Gruner in the first film) came across the horrible plot that involved replacing humans with machines, but since then a war between cyborgs and humans has emerged and we've lost, now a superwoman who is the daughter of the character of Olivier Gruner (she inherits even half of her minimal acting ability) which I think is the least connection of the film to the first, however when the superwoman is created she hides in 1980 while a bounty hunter from the future the hunt in this confusing science fiction clunker. Nemesis became a cult hit, which I can understand because people liked it even though I wasn't a fan of the movie. Nemesis tried very ambitiously to invent different ideas, to develop good looks and to provide a lot of action, it almost worked. Nemesis 2 does not even have that ambition, it is a cheap rip-off of The Terminator with a muscular woman who has a acting ability so low as to make Olivier Gruner look like a master and the action sequences lack the explosive scope that was the main selling point of the original. I admit that I wasn't a fan of the original, but deserved a better following than this. The original also contained a cast like Tim Thomerson, Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, Thom Mathews, Brion James, Thomas Jane and yes Jackie Earle Haley, this one has no one and this time it's just a boring movie with a pretentious air. In fact, after seeing it, it was useful to add half a star to the original. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
