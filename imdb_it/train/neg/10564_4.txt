The real shame of "The Gathering" is not in bad acting, nor in the contemptuously superficial plot. The real shame is that it was much worse than the series started, even though it had a major attraction: Takashima. I'd like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova, even for five minutes. He has that sarcasm, that wit, that double-edged personality that is both volatile and lovable. Unfortunately, however, the pilot movie "Babylon 5" has an incredibly boring story that involves murder. Patricia Tallman - who never seriously returned to the series until much later - fortunately she improved a lot with the age of Lyta Alexander, who here is little more than a whining and boring telepath. Will I leave you with one last thought ... why does Delenn look like a kind of frogman in outer space (even if she's a woman)? Thank God for the way Minbari looked further into the show.
