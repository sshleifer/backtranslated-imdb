All the buzz of the internet aside, this movie was a horrible god. I expected the film to be more of a farce than anything else. Instead the directors tried to make a serious thriller / horror film, and they completely lost. There were only a few good parts and a couple of good lines from Samuel Jackson. Apart from that, it was a bunch of gore and some uninspired snakes. All the jokes on the internet were better miles than the actual movie. Now that the movie is out, I hope this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of excessive junk. If you're looking for something fun and entertaining, just go to Snakes on a Blog.
