I love science fiction, I am fascinated by Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I thought that a film that combines these three would be at least pleasant. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or actually the lack there) was completely uninspired and unimaginative - while the imagination is usually the greatest component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and acting are even worse than an average porn movie. Especially Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term "bad performance". The bad action would not have been such a big problem if only the "director" Bilal had not taken himself so seriously; all the lines sound like they should be poetic, it seems that Bilal really thinks he made a work of art here. Well, there is no art or poetry to be found in this piece of junk, just pretentiousness! This man should really stick to making comics, since he fails on all possible accounts as a director. The worst thing is the terrible digital animation, which is so bad that it actually turns this film into a physically painful experience. The graphics are so fake that they even make werewolves in "Van Helsing" as live actors! And since half of the characters are animated in CGI, it's rather a problem that the CGI effects are so fake. If the Egyptian gods really exist, Bilal is dead, since they will no doubt take a gruesome revenge on him for the ridiculous way he portrays them in this disastrously bad movie.
