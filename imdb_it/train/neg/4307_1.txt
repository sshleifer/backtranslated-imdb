Seemingly destined to be a movie thriller, it ends up being almost ridiculous. He pushed me to exclaim "Oh my God!" more than once to the complicated plot intrigues that were simply silly. <br /> <br /> Imaginative or absurd places only for pure novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to understand why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to find out how bad a picture can be, you'd like to see it. Otherwise, take the time to look at some paint for a more productive investment of time! <br /> <br /> (That a film released in 2003 has already been shown on TV in July 2003 could give an indication of the quality of the film)
