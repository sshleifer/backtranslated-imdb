I haven't seen anything so serious since I got out of the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit for the totality of this just because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast. <br /> <br /> As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film failed miserably in every aspect of cinema. The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was quite incredible. The acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this film is that there was Tilda Swinton. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber agreed to appear in such a disaster, but most likely regret it now. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money or your time with this smell. There is nothing to see here.
