I went to see this film with a crowd that consisted mostly of spiritual "New Age" types, which, unlike me, I liked a lot about this movie --- even if according to those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book that contains more than this nonsense), the film is not so good. So, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", believe or at least you can tolerate things like "aura" and "astral body", and don't worry about the frequent use of the term "energy" outside the context of physics or technology, the film might really like it and will probably enjoy it even more than the book on which it is apparently based. <br /> <br /> However, if you are more in touch with the physical universe, if your ability is to suspend disbelief it is easily exhausted by New Age nonsense and plots based on it, if in addition it it has a low tolerance for pungent lighting effects to denote the occurrence of spirituality, and perhaps even expect a reasonable dialogue not of wood and acting, so this is my recommendation for you regarding this movie: Stay. Street. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about it. Tonight, this film has moved Dungeons and Dragons like the worst movie I've ever personally seen in a movie theater (I don't consider the movies I went to see with the expectation of being bad, like plan 9, etc.). At the same time, he raised the total number of films that I almost left at two (D & D is the other). I don't go out on the movies, not even on this one, but I should have seen it when I saw the visual representation of an aura for the first time, because the New Age BS continues to get thicker and thicker from that point on. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a group of people who behave with some old prophecies, in a search for spiritual enlightenment and aim to bring humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something similar. They actually talk about this spiritual stuff that represents the next step in human evolution, which should make anyone even the slightest idea of ​​what anger human evolution is. The film is full of suspense like this. Occasionally people reason on what they would surely define as "another dimension", or perhaps "another plan", only to become invisible to those around them who have not yet reached enlightenment. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end the director patronizes the audience by rolling the painfully slow "intuitions" that make up the prophecy, presumably so that we can memorize them and leave the cinema as better, more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good things about the movie? Some shots of a very nice nature, and some discreet supporting performances by Elizondo and de Almeida. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that this seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if he considers this film interesting or acceptable. It is really spiritualism and cheapo of the most naive type, and unless it is your thing, you would do better with your time and money.
