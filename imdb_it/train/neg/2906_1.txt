- it could contain spoilers ... but believe me, this movie breaks down from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> I entered this film with high expectations. It was my fault. Until today I had put too much stuff in Steve Carell's log. 40 years old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... The Office. And I also made the mistake of coming to IMDb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie. He has always been a great predictor in the past, but lately something has gone wrong. The last time I felt this embarrassment and in this pain in a movie theater was watching "Blue Steel" in 1990. <br /> <br /> This film went up in smoke from start to finish. The script was awkward material. Terrible writing all around. "Assassin of love"? "Love is a skill"? Anyone who has written this crap has suffered from the same affliction that struck the writer / s of American Beauty ... trying too badly waaaaayyyyyy. The whole film was punctuated by moments of Three's Company as the horrible and forced shower scene. Or the useless / confusing aerobic scene. Or the horrible laundry scene. Just when you think that something serious and / or real is going to happen, they throw themselves into one of these terrible moments. And it happens again and again and again. <br /> <br /> And what is Carell's character? Is the guy meeting a bit lame in a book store and suddenly falling madly in love? Let's face it. Their conversation was sucked. Both would have to say their farewell after a few minutes. Pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune to watch this movie .... Carell's character is trying to say something that is absolutely random and not funny (I think the exact line was "this time when I was a boy" ... seriously.) But both are laughing so hard that the coffee is about to come out of the nose. The actors themselves seemed to suffer, wondering why they were going to do what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Go back to the IMDb story ... you guys have to find a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site. I know it's impossible, but it's painfully obvious that the first 20 reviews / reviews have been published for 12 years or by Flunky hired by the studio. Check out The Family Stone's rating ... if it's a 5, then this must be absolutely 2 ... and that's pushing it.
