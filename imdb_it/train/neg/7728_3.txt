.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw this and it is sequel when originally transmitted, and like many others it was wiped out. At the beginning of 2002 I borrowed novels for both WOW and W and R and I was even more impressed. Then I decided that I had to see both again and invested $ 200 more on DVD sets. I looked at both minis again in painful detail and realized that I had done things backwards - I would have had to buy the novels and borrow the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Don't you think it's an abyss mix? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don't you think this is dated? Project it for someone who is not old enough to have seen it transmitted originally and look at the reaction you receive (attention - these people's reactions range from looks of horror to belly laughs). <br /> <br /> According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Oh God !! Production quality, soundtracks, dialogues - a great story has been transformed into a telenovela from the late 1970s by an overly ambitious producer / director who was in the lead. This thing has been dated at the time it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were fantastic when transmitted in the original and those of us who saw them then, pulling a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO: this mini is not up to its reputation and disappoints deeply.
