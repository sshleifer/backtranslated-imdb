The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, free sex and nudity, murder and chaos ... on the paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, funny shot given the ingredients . It is not. It's a plot less, inconsistent that brings little fun. There is hardly any plot besides something vague about a cult following De Sade's work that for some unclear reason feels the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. This is more or less ... I think he has something with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers thought. Most of the film is a tortuous chaos, as the heroine is exposed to various oddities, dream sequences and erotic encounters, and intertwines with the scenes of Englund while the De Sade imprisoned in the nineteenth century chewed the scenery. It seems that the producers were looking for something serious, but whatever their claim, they were buried in the form of cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake decapitated heads. <br /> <br /> There are not too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, although not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of stripping for the film, but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the "When You're Criminal Like Me" bit the guide to Australian movie classifications that was in the front row of so many VHS tapes from the 90s.
