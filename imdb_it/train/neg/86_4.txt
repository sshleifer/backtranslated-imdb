As a Southern Baptist, it pains me to have to give a rating below the average of an overtly Christian film. There are not so many that I want to discourage filmmakers from a genre that is sadly undervalued. Still, I must honestly say that "Love's Abiding Joy" is a typically low-budget, low-key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, mediocre acting (I'm kind), and atrocious editing. As a TV movie it may be slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves a lot to be desired. Keep trying guys. You have to have a movie about real Christians in you somewhere. Can I suggest addressing G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
