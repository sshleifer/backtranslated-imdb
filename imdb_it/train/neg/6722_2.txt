Are you ever sitting in a movie and after it's all over it's like a big "wtf!?". <br /> <br /> Welcome to Decoy. <br /> <br /> Another fodder movie for video action that you can immediately forget having seen or better yet not watching at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick will quickly be wasted in this fast-paced mercenary action game where the plot is damn bad and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action movie if the action explodes? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that makes him shoot a machine gun while he is on the bonnet of a moving school bus. Co-protagonist the environment Charlotte Lewis and the Canadian Scott Hylands (of the fame Night Heat of the TV).
