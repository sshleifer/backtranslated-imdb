** SPOILERS BELOW !!! ** <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever has my assent for the WORST movie of the year ... which I saw. This movie is straight GARBAGE! There is so much wrong in the movie that you can't help but be amazed at how bad it really is. This film had so much potential to be good, but in the end it did nothing. The characters were as stupid as one can be; for the whole movie you're just wondering "why would you do that?" or "what's your point in doing this?" ... this is how illogical and stupid the characters are. We don't have any backgrounds in them, so of course you don't give rats as much as their fate ... you could just laugh at their stupidity. <br /> <br /> - The "bitch" (Marcy) for example ... was she so excited that she had to sleep with Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no reason to do it ... it is as if the directors needed an excuse to give her the virus so voila! UGH. <br /> <br /> - Would anyone really go into the woods and drink water from a tap in a cabin without looking at it first? <br /> <br /> - Why didn't Bert just shoot the patient from the start? The film would have ended up that way ... besides, they ended up killing him anyway. <br /> <br /> - Why did it take so long to finally decide to leave the cab, even if they had to walk? "No, I'll wait until 2 of my friends get infected (a blink of an eye from death) to decide to get out of there. <br /> <br /> - What exactly was the reasoning behind Paul's attempt to fish out of the body of the Hermit, only to fall into the contaminated tank and become infected with the virus? Pure STUPIDITY! <br /> <br /> I swear, common sense was not a friend, much less an expert of these idiots. I think there has never been a worse ending for a film. At first the children ask the cashier of the hick store what the gun was, and he replies that "it's for the niggers". At the end of the film, 3 young blacks ( dressed in baggy clothes, one of which in a du-rag no less) they enter the shop ... come and find out that the cashier cleaned it to make them use for hunting. THEN, he proceeds to give them all the kilos and straits hand and joke with them as if they were his hosts. <br /> <br /> Ok, THAT THE HELL WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!?!?!? How insipid can it be, what were the filmmakers THINKING they had included in the film? I, as a black man, was obviously offended by the initial comment of "Nigger". It was an insignificant and pointless observation. My question to the directors: what was the point of the final with the black guys? Was it to force me to forget the initial racist comment I made earlier? To smooth things out with black viewers, playing a joke? Well, I for one, I did NOT find that pathetic attempt at humor funny. The whole film was a joke ... a PATHETIC attempt at the cinema that should not be given at the time of day. Did Peter Jackson really think this movie was so beautiful? What movie was HE watching? <br /> <br /> ZERO * of stars **** .... if I could give it a lower rating I would do it. Please, IMDb mates, don't waste 1 1/2 hours of your precious life watching this "movie" abomination. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
