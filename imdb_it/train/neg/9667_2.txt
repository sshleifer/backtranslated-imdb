This film is rightly famous as one of the most horrific examples of propaganda ever produced. The insistent equation of the Jews with the disease is simply pathological, and even worse becomes almost credible for short seconds <br /> <br /> through its pure repetition. The fact that something of this crude works, even <br /> <br /> briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You must have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this, and I would not recommend trying if you don't have a good reason.
