I had just seen an episode of this program and I couldn't even get to the end of the program. Every minute I watched this program my IQ had to be dropped by about 10 points. This is basically like a children's program, but with bad words. Not even the bad words and insults he tells other people made me laugh. However the story must have been written by a monkey and the people who actually wrote this script for this film must be kept at the shooting point and had no choice but to film this delayed, disappointing and horribly played program. Sarah Silvermann should use the little money she has earned from this program and get some lessons from god damn acting.
