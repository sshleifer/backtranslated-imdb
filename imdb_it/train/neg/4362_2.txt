A group of human-looking aliens who go to Earth to eat earth crash into a planet of prehistoric animals instead where they eat all the physical fungi and act retarded. Filled with footage from "Planet of the Dinosuars" and horrible jokes this is definitely one to lose. Even acting is atrocious, and even if it's not as bad as "Chickboxer" (which film can it be?) This is still a horrible and repulsive thing. It's 90 minutes of running time that seems like an eternity and you'll probably swear your life so give yourself a huge favor and move on, skip this lousy movie, there's nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers try to resell this asshole as an MST3K style by making fun of the film they made a decade earlier, and it works even if it's still nothing to look at, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a rather unattractive speaking voice. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: comment from Joke, 17 featurette Behind the scenes; 7 minutes in the black featurette; Jessica Mills reporting; Image Gallery; and original trailer
