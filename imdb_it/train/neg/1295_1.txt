this is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love Japanese films and I think another film by the same director, the 80,000 v electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted you to like this film - asano is an exceptional actor and the plot was immensely attractive. but I haven't found anything funny about it. <br /> <br /> the film takes forever to prevent anything from happening. and the effects the director used - such as constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - simply added to my growing irritation that the plot was so incredibly slow and the actors were terribly exaggerated. a lot of boredom was the result of extraneous additions that were completely useless - like an hour spent on asano going around cutting buddha statues and proclaiming how he loves nothing. this added nothing to the plot. a Japanese cinema partner and I was constantly checking the time. we couldn't believe this movie was so terrible. and the ending was terrible. I thought the director would have at least tried to reward the viewer to be able to sit through it, but unfortunately I was wrong.
