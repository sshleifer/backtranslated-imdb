The clich√© of the soldier's house shocked by the shell of war is here given a boring treatment. Too bad for a splendid cast, who acts within the limits of their great talents, he cannot redeem "The return of the soldier" from his inability to stiff collar to move the viewer towards emotional involvement. The best moments, as another reviewer noted, come when Glenda Jackson is on the screen; but even Jackson's crackling cinematic power fails to snatch the chestnuts of this movie from its cold, never-heated hearth. Ann-Margret, a kitten and too often accused of lacking acting ability, finds her real and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite having spoken with an almost flawless Middlesex accent. The watershed, truculent of many threatening television miniseries, a crowded cheesy emotionality, is in irritating contrast with the emotional distance of the script, the block and the exaggerated formalism of the director; apart from the score and the script and the direction of the run, "The return of the soldier" has all the right bits but fails to make them work together.
