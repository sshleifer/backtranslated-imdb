I think the biggest disappointment in this film was that, until the end, I expected the acting cast teachers to intrude and apologize for the poor quality of the acting. When you consider the powerful subject, the fantastic scenery and the effort made to create a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a pity that little attention has been given to acting. <br /> <br />
