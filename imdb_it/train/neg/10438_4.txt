the movie sucked, it wasn't funny, it wasn't exciting. they tried to make it so negative that it would have been good, but it failed. And to think that it's nice that this film, along with the hype, is the only reason why this film is a success ... <br /> <br /> the fact that at this moment 50% voted a 10 on 10 for this film seems to me rather worrying, or the fact that the film becomes public is becoming insane or this vote is unrealistic and can have numerous causes, and should be addressed. in any case it is a less than average film that has flourished through mouth-to-mouth advertising. Its success can only be described as a marvel of marketing.
