OK, a slasher movie. a very, very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> We made your teenage stereotypes in a house. We have an FBI agent who saw Dirty Harry once too often. "So what's the secret ... punk?" We have about 4 different small shots and scenes that make no sense. "Hey buddy, I'm fixing the sprinklers" ((that guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there's a preacher tied up on a couch watching movies at home, he is killed. <br /> <br /> follow the killer in the middle of nowhere, without cops. suddenly she's in a church, wearing a wedding dress. I swear this is the stupid slasher movie I've ever seen.
