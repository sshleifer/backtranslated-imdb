A usual Italian-western stuff, a stupid plot full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punches and people shooting to death on a large scale. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German-translated version, this German DVD-release is called "Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callaghan fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their band killed his (he's the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they fight and the band splits. And you have Ironhead who fights against everyone because he is the biggest and the greediest jerk anyway. Yes, that's all, there is no more intelligence in the plot, hehe. <br /> <br /> A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene he tries to separate two men fighting by hitting them and shouting "I said love!" and in another scene he wins a horseshoe throwing contest and goes crazy for a second - FANTASTICFANTASTICFANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO, aka Aristide Massaccesi, did the photography - I love this master of incompetent thrash exploitation, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
