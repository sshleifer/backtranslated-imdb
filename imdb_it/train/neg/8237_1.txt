How has this film been distributed in the name of all that is holy? It looks like it was shot on someone's cell phone and brings the scenery of a screaming girl's victims to new depths. They literally shout for the whole 90 minutes of the film. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no character and not much acting. Screaming and screaming more. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and quickly freed myself to see if anything had happened. Not ... except to scream, of course. Oddly enough, the act of moving forward fast shows another problem - there is no camera to talk about. Each stroke resembles every other shot - medium distance, a corner, dull, boring, DULL. <br /> <br /> It's not so bad it's good. It's just ugly.
