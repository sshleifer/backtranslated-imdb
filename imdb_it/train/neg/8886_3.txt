Not very impressed. It is difficult to offer spoilers for this film, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and from there it's like looking at dry paint. Even the acting seems very poor, and reminds me of the old black and white Maoist movies occasionally shown on Chinese daytime television. Although this is hard to say with the female role, Yuwen, since the story seems to require only that you walk like a wooden dummy. It reminds me of the vanished star Gong Li who somehow earned a reputation as a good actress in the West to always have a frown on her face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's movie "Blue Kite" was a much better film. But don't be fooled by the fact that spring in a small town was set at the end of the 1940s. Unlike the Blue Kite, the fact that this film is set in a moment of upheaval is irrelevant to the plot itself, the ruins of the city seem to be nothing more than a scenic background. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Tian Zhuangzhuang is simply trying to ride the popularity of Chinese films in the West and is targeting a foreign audience that cannot tell the difference between a "beautiful" "deep" or "hypnotic" "and one that is simply boring and inconsistent. <br /> <br /> If a film fits the description of "overrated", this is it. Here I see no reason to stop worrying about the state of the Chinese film industry.
