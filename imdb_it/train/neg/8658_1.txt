A large part of the scenes should be cut. There are many scenes that should have been cut. For example the scene in which the hunters mention "I got spider on my dick", "I like dick", the game in the muddy scene, or a bar scene in which a professional dinocroc hunter is a snake charmer. <br /> <br /> How about other terribly incoherent scenes with a woman, Diane who wants to lose her virginity with a boy who walks as if she wore women's panties of three sizes too small. While they make love, haven't they realized that they are doing it next to the child who will soon run away and lose his head? Why did they do it in a living room? I mean his head is really upside down. How about the beach scene that is reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene in Grant Lake. All these strange scenes could easily be repeated and commented like a comedy. <br /> <br /> Here in my city, cineplex cinemas have been advertising for months on Dinocroc, and I'm glad I didn't watch because I later discovered that it was only shown for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The film was so bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie by watching the preview. Presents Dinocroc's leg that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and clawed slippers and walking up and down like a 2 year old child. It could easily be passed as Baby Genius. <br /> <br /> If any film production student wants to learn what not to do, it's a real classic junk. Like Diane's boyfriend, who walks as if he had an advanced case of syphilis, you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before drinking beer. When does this happen, who cares about Dinocroc? The underpants man looked more interesting than the entire Dinocroc film. His acting was bad, it's a much better substitute for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comic talent in a horror sci-fi movie. Perhaps the worst casting in Hollywood history.
