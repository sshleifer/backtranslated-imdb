When I decided to watch THE BARBARIANS, starring those two twin bodybuilders, Peter and David Paul, I thought it couldn't be so bad because the film was directed by Ruggero Deodato, who has a reputation for creating unpleasant films, but well done. Well, THE BARBARIANS is a decidedly scruffy action / adventure film that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN, and fails at all levels. The appearance of the film is completely wrong. Some scenes have been well shot, but the disgusting and sticky tone and "disc" appearance of the clothes and hair are simply decorated makes no sense, even for a low budget film like this. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairstyle and costume. It should be threatening but comes across a fool. And it's fun to see Eva LaRue Callahan, one of the stars of ALL MY CHILDREN, appear in her first film, out in a skimpy bikini. I'm sure he wants this disaster to disappear from the face of the earth! The so-called barbaric twins are as good as the heroes tied to the muscles but it is almost impossible to build a proper critique of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. The only way the movie tries to distinguish one twin from the other is to have a twin wearing a thong that covers his ass, while the thong of the other twin barely covers his muscular backside. I'm not kidding! Don't ask me who is who. <br /> <br /> Deodato had to be really desperate to accept making this film. And his despair is reflected perfectly in this trash movie. It's just ugly.
