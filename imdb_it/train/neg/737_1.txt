WOW! <br /> <br /> I was given this movie by a friend of mine, who bought it for 1.98 at Walmart, and felt he was caught! It's beyond boredom, most of the scenes are shot in front of a green screen, the acting is somewhat improvised, almost as if they didn't have a script. Martians are CGIs, which appear to be made by a beginner or a film produced by Fan. I can't stress how bad this DVD really is! <br /> <br /> Example: in one of the scenes, the Martians are torturing a local female prisoner. Switch from a woman in front of a green screen to a copy of that woman's CGI. The change is quite evident, and when it is killed, you can see that it is a computer figure, which looks like something from a 1990 game! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid this movie like plague! You can download two trailers from their website and see how terrible it really is!
