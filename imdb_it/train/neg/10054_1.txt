I'm not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a film that Richard Donner masterfully performed. I'm not alone in despising Superman 2 by Richard Lester ... which brings us to Richard Donner's cut of the same film, unfortunately it's still an absolute abomination. <br /> <br /> The world of Superman is one in which suspending disbelief is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It doesn't matter who directed Superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grade student. In a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivations to act like they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, Superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I won't worry. I condemn this film ... perhaps the slapstick in Lester's version is more appropriate to the Moorish script on which this film is based. Super-Duper bad.
