Oh, it's the movie - I thought I waited too long to get the dog out ... I can't believe I saw it all. I imagine optimistically anticipating that it would improve. Horrible untied dialogue, pathetic action and totally unlikely events. Like Toby's mother who hangs herself over the time that Col uses to walk upstairs and back to a room with a 24 'ceiling and no chairs, benches or anything else around her suspended, immobile body that she could have used for climbing The child who played the daughter of the last family was the best actor in the whole film, and the puppy of the first couple was a close second. The basic plot has potential and with a good script and direction it could be a really terrifying film, but unfortunately this version is not. I get more scared when I open my electric bill every month.
