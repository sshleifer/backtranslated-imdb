I've never seen this movie but I can tell you something about its production. During a comedy / oldies DJ radio in 1988, I received a call from the production company. They asked me if I had written and recorded a little and they would have fallen into the soundtrack like the sounds made by a television set (the same television screen would never have been shown). I certainly said, I wrote a parody of the science fiction clich√©s of the 50s, I rounded up some sound effects and called another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. While he was on the air at that time, he put on a long song, joined me at the microphone in the production hall and cut the voicetrack in a single shot. Chuckling, he returned to his show while mixing up the silly sound effects. We would never have done it if we had known that "Woodchipper Massacre" would have become such a turkey - but, even in this case, we never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
