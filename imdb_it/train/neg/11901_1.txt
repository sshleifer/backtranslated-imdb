"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the directorial career of the German director Wim Wenders. Many have heard it in "The Million Dollar Hotel" and now "Land of Plenty" makes it perfectly clear; not only did he lose Wenders, he became a BAD director, creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. <br /> <br /> It could be argued that the "time that is lost" comes for every director, but Wenders' case is extreme. It's like he completely forgets everything he knew about cinema and started all over again - just to get poor results. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this film is not worth your time.
