The wealthy widower Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochist lover and English lord. He carries red-haired sexy women to his castle, where he whips them and kills them. The Black-booted stripper Erika Blanc (in the role of Susie) leaves temporarily. Mr. Steffen is infested by his wife "Evelyn" who died during childbirth. As a therapy, he decides to marry again, after meeting the beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). At the end of the film, they have had to dig some more tombs. "The night Evelyn came out of the grave" is a great title. <br /> <br /> ** The night that Evelyn came out of the grave (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
