In this paranoia windshield, our hero reporter fights intriguing authorities, duplicate colleagues, renegade UFO debunkers and silent, stealthy aliens. (Although he is able to control the mind and hoe objects from a distance, it takes three to operate a control panel of about two dozen buttons.) The script switches from one event to another, leaving puzzles in abundance. Why did the aliens blind the dog? Why fry soldiers with radiation when they are patrolling only an empty landing site? And which space guys who are worth their moon cheese first kidnap the ugly photographer instead of his model? Curious minds want to know! Screenwriter and director Mario Gariazzo apparently studied his subject by browsing through a stack of UFO-themed tabloids while taking a double feature film by Sunn Classics. (The final scan screen boasts that it is based on real events ... just like "Plan 9!") Some may feel burned by the abrupt ending, but it should still please the conspiracy managers.
