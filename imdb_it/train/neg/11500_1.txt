This move is slow, tiring, cold, dark and without plot or hope. It follows that the true and tried European formula that they like to subsidize, that is never seen, but that critics think creates an "important point". <br /> <br /> The film is valuable if only to show the huge difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans regarding employment. In this film, men have been treating their wounds for years and feel that it is the government's duty to provide them with work. While in the US we know we have to go out there and create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain has never seemed so backward!
