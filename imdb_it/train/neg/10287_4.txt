It's available on "Drive In Double Feature" by Dark Sky Films, and since I just finished "Barracuda", I've seen that too. This is a film that proves to be incredibly ambitious and inept at the same time. <br /> <br /> Let's start with two young women wandering the streets of some foreign city, but where exactly are they? They stop to look at the necklaces of some Chinese sellers and try Chinese-style clothes in a store, but then we see some Aztec dancers? And all this time, these girls are followed by two boys, who eventually abandon any stealth they don't have to chase the girls on a wild ride through the city, and eventually catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a rope around her neck, and these guys want to find the loot, and where did she get it? So, in the flashback, let's go back to find out. And how did they know he had this coin? Hard to say, really. <br /> <br /> Now, in the past, when these two women were 10, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, and after stopping to get some air in their tanks, they tow this young boy at his dock at home, just to let his grandfather out and invite the unmarried "young men" for the herbal tea with his grandmother. But not everyone has tea, Todd is back on the boat to check out the girls, and then when they get out of there, the boat explodes, and when they get home their friends have mysteriously disappeared. Well, it seems that these "kind people" grow their own vegetables but they wait for the meat to fall for a spell and serve them herbal teas. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd have left the island, but now, they are coming back, escorted by their captors, and they are there to find the treasure, despite the fact that no one has ever shown the girls where it was FIRST . It seems that there is also someone else on the island, and the thugs begin mysteriously to die, one by one, and since there are only three, it doesn't take much. And there is also a sort of happy ending, which will leave the viewer equally baffled as they have been for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be speed freaks with anger problems and combined without acting skills are hilarious to the limit. The hillbilly-type family is also lacking in acting skills, despite his grandfather being Hank Worden, who has appeared in many films and television programs. The action is confusing, the locals are even more confused, and the island looks like Southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I'm not sure, but it's definitely worth seeing once so you can think (or say), eh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.
