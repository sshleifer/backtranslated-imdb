Alas, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, and let me tell you, THIS SUCKING VERSION! I don't know who of all the people puts the money for this wreck, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They took the classic game and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable. This version is literally so serious, that not even the presence of a great actor like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save him. The redemption quality of this film is that it has become an excellent fodder for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow had a great time with this. <br /> <br /> But in both cases, I'm sure that Shakespeare, if he had been alive when they did, wouldn't have wanted his name to be associated with it. This "Hamlet" is not even so bad that it is beautiful; it's just ugly. Absolutely terrible
