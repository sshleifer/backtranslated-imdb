Well, this movie started in a fun way but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be a more "adult" humor based on the first few moments, but then the film switched to a bad Disney channel, especially in a go-kart scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is beautiful but has a really fake Italian accent. The film seemed very independent and with a low budget. There was a very nice moment that I will simply call the serenade scene, but overall this was a yawn. The laughter is very few and far between. The final surprise for "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous that it left me crazier than anything else. It might be worth a look if you can take it for free or on TV but don't waste your money buying or renting this movie.
