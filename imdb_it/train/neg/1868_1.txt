This movie is terrible. Each line is stolen by 8 MM (at least the Italian double version). If you like garbage ... real garbage, try it; but beware: this is not the kind of film "so bad is good". In its cheapness, it could really look like a porn but, believe me, if you're looking for "snuff", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even a normal erotic thriller, go find something else in the store! I'm telling you this, because the shots, the acting, the plot, the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing dialogues (the only good jokes, like I said before, are the ones that stole from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) They'll bore you until tears in a few minutes and the "happy ending" is absolutely revolting! I'll give him a star: one half for the sudden blow to the back scene, after the monologue "the eyes of the victim" (also stolen from 8MM) and a half for the sexy bodies of mom and daughter (which they didn't manage to keep me completely awake while watching this turkey, anyway!)
