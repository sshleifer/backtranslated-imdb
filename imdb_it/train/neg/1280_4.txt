When I saw the name of this film, I always thought it was a musical. Like "The Harvey Girls". It is not. It is overcooked pudding, it hit the kitchen ceiling, and it is split and put together. No music and not a period piece, but absolutely unlikely. <br /> <br /> Start with the patriarch James Woods who tells the first of his three daughters, a little girl who becomes Barbara Stanwyck, who must keep the family name and home. <br /> <br /> We therefore think that it will be a historical intergenerational story. And it is, for a short time. Then it turns into the story of Stanwyck's ruthless struggle against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead against him? Well, why else? While learning in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck, he once thought he could inherit money (for his sisters and for himself, of course) by marrying. He hit someone he took to be a farmer, who was actually the budding lawyer Brent. <br /> <br /> In order for no one to think about the child they have, a young man of about eight at the time of the main plot is - well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together, it was conceived. <br /> <br /> One of her sisters is in love with a painter called Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young. The other sister tries to take him away. Etc., Etc. <br /> <br /> It is a shrill and disenchanted mess, well executed but without a shred of logic or plausibility.
