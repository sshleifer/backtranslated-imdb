Bad actors, bad shots, clumsy dialogues, superficial characters, but then again it was a bad premise. Basically, an 11-year-old child who is bullied because he has little money is given a blank check by a dying criminal. Obviously, the eleven-year-old seems to have enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, cash a check for $ 1,000,000, and even foil three clumsy idiots, reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying and hateful guy, who decides that when he has written a blank check from a complete stranger, he will take advantage of the situation as best he can. In other words, he wanders into a bank, gives a cashier a check he makes in his printer and, miraculously, comes up with a million dollars in cash. Apparently even Preston is able to reach incredible speeds on his bike, since a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed couldn't catch him, even when Preston jumped on a row of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every hockey adventure movie, there must be hot heroin. In this case, our hot heroine is a child who harasses the FBI agent who dates back to eleven-year-old Preston and promises another date when he completes his 17. <br /> <br /> However, the worst aspect this film was not the casting itself, nor its sloppy dialogue, like "The only other way I could think of skinning a cat is to stick a tube on its bottom and then pick up the fur." It was, rather, the whole fact that no one in the whole film seemed to realize that the FBI didn't give a damn about random people. What I couldn't explain is that Preston uses the alias "Macintosh" to masquerade as an entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds him intriguing and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old spirit to scream when lobsters fall on his face, then treats her with hamburgers, ending up with a ridiculous joke in an area cemented where water jets from the ground. Our heroine fails to realize during this entire adventure that the criminal the FBI is following is slipping and slipping behind the two, as they head for Preston's limousine, complete with a one-dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap, 3rd speed Ride that the whole family can suffocate. <br /> <br /> In general: 1/10 is incredibly nice for this movie. I don't see how he only has a 4.4 / 10.
