It is one of those dramas that is so ugly that it almost reaches the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely terrible, a terrifying direction, a purely armed illumination, the only thing that lets it fall from a real so bad is the good feeling that the sound design is just pretty bad; it does not add suspense to the plot, even if it is striving, but at least it does not destroy any speech. There are problems with the continuity of outdoor shooting seasons. And finally, last but not least, acting is terrifying. For a professional production it has a lot of the impression of a university media project that you have to feel sorry for the displeasure for whoever had to put their names to this.
