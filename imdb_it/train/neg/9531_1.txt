This is a terrible film. Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give regarding a plot or a "spoiler". I would just like to comment that the ending is almost the most absurd part of the film. Much of the film involves Locke and Camp cackling hatefully, while psychotically smiling at the camera. Add to this a soundtrack that repeats again and again, including a Vaudevillian song about "dear old daddy" that suggests an incestuous quality that the observer never really sees. The music is initially annoying, so it ends up subjecting the viewer to a torture worse than the one depicted on the screen. The theme here is of silly managed youth, understandable as a reaction to the 60s, but made with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
