Why? Because for a reason, there has never been a more adorable scene in any of Ann Margret's films singing "Bye Bye Birdie" at the inauguration. He also takes it up again at the end (in a different mood!). Both wonderful. Rent it and see. Even if it's all you watch. You'll agree, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Everything about the original was so excellent that you didn't need a remake, sorry! Jason and Vanessa gave commendable performances, in addition to Tyne and Chynna. In fact, all the actors and singers of this new version were giving their "whole", but it's like trying to improve on "Casablanca" - it can't be done! It's even annoying to be confronted mentally while trying to appreciate the remake, and it's not up to the actors.
