As a girl, Hinako moved from her small village in Tokyo, leaving behind her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to find that Sayori died when she was a teenager. He reunites with Fumiya and I am horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected through Shikoku island. Oh boy. I rented it because I like Asian horror and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is an elegant actress. Unfortunately, if I had to describe Shikoku in one word, it would be "fruity". This film is silly, boring, poorly filmed, lacking in imagination and, above all, it is not. Kuriyama has minimal time on the screen as the resurrected Sayori and his character is given little to work.
