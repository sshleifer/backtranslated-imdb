When bushworms become really easy to do, a show like this should make it something extra. When that something extra is a version for children of political figures who make jokes about the future that they don't have yet, it's simply an absurdity. Dick Cheney and George Bush are good but Dick Cheney mostly whispers. There is also Condoleeza Rice who has a crush on Bush for some reason and Donald Rumsfeld who is not at all so similar to Donald Rumsfeld. Democratic characters rarely give their name, so it's a mystery about who could be anyone other than Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton. <br /> <br /> The episodes have consistent stories but it is not enough to prevent this from sinking.
