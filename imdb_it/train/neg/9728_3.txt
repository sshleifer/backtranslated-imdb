Tobe Hooper made great films so I was sure this couldn't be BAD. I didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this film unintentionally humorous. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes it made me almost CRY for Hooper. <br /> <br /> I voted this 3/10 because his 1990 "horror" -movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the film I was thinking of something like "they simply CAN'T add more things to this movie ..." .. but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say this is kind of a Firestarter clone but it really isn't. It's based on that idea, but that's all. This is combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / god things, funny gores, simple effects, dramas, horrible acting, incredible script ... and more. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * The story is: the government tries to create a definitive weapon that uses nuclear energy or something like that and fails, during the process the child is born for 2 test people. When the mother sings to her son after birth, both the husband and the wife burn and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. The government buries everything and lets this child live among other people and ... after x years this child has grown up and realizes that he was born for a reason and with whom he can burn things with his brain. Then everything becomes incredibly messy, nothing really explains anything and ... Well, when the government realizes "okay, it can focus this thing on fire", they take it to the normal hospital where there is something nuclear toxic about what they will use on this man WHY they could kill him, no they can't shoot him no! .. and argh, I guess that's enough to say, I promise that there are 100 more strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> Well, if you want good laughs, look at this. Wow.
