What is this ? A cheap sexual comedy? In any case he perfectly describes the people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I mean they make this kind of film from the 60s .. and people like them! This is not a comedy for teenagers or a family (you can't let your 12 years look at 2 boys in bed kissing, he will never want to go to Spain). This should be rated "R", because only 35+ people seem to be laughing looking at: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I don't like gays (which is a pretty big part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stay true to the dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
