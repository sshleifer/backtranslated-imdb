If you are one of the people who finds the television play "According to Jim", this will drive your world crazy. And I could add, congratulations for showing that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, who prefers to suck like the Jim Belushi show year after year. <br /> <br /> "K-911" is a large, steaming, brown, German "thank you" for all the geniuses who loved the first movie. That's exactly what the fans of that movie and the lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's costume design and choice in projects are never far from his ability to slaughter a standard blues. Look for it to try to show all its different talents in every project it launches to the public as a chimpanzee chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> If you like Jim's work, this film is your reward.
