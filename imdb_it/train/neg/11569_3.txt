Even if you subscribe to the anti-free policy of this film, it's still the same tired note, played again and again and again. Clink clink. Even if you can accept a preacher with bleached hair that supports a return to the first principles, Reverend Billy is rather difficult to consider as a serious figure. The clownish reverend is the type who wakes up every morning without a more ethereal aspiration than seeing his face on TV before going back to bed that night. He has a beautiful wife, I have to admit, but it will take tons more to save this movie mess. The endless bus rides are the worst part - with the progress shown - can you guess? - with a colored line that moves on a map. Aww, you guessed it. Oh well, it has the virtue of being short. Is this the only favorable thing I can say? Hmmmm. Yes, I'm afraid.
