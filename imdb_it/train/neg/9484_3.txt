If I have to give this film a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was fun, and there are lots of good things to say about the movie. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and he is out and willing to "change the world". <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of In the film you know that the hospital hides an evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and does not recognize this evil. <br /> <br /> The story develops quite well, you know all the time that there is a truth about what patients are telling about an evil resident, and I ask when and how James will find out. Even when the break comes, James is somehow hunted by evil, and you feel a little suspense until "the fight" is over. <br /> <br /> Add a beautiful innocent girl who arrives at the worst possible moment other standard horror elements, and get the picture. <br /> <br /> The accumulation of characters is actually quite good, most people being killed are presented to you, some of whom you "know". <br /> <br /> The film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done quite well. There are mysteries that are revealed - in an acceptable way. <br /> <br /> The main character, James is very credible - the story of an eager student who is starting to work is good in this setting. <br /> <br /> What kills this film is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from space" - bad guy (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad action (or probably very few takes during filming) - The main characters sometimes act badly, and somehow it's fine. * The sound is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I kept thinking "I could make a movie like this with my home camera" throughout the movie.
