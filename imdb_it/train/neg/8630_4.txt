I know that in this episode there are other things besides what I am about to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, after receiving a very negative opinion about Jin from seeing Sun's flashbacks in "House of the Rising Sun", we can see the Jin part of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. Before now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was hinted that Sun's father was someone who was getting rich with obscure and illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mafia boss, too; mobs operate in Korea, just like in most other countries in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that Sun's father is actually the head (or manager) of a Korean automobile company, and that what Jin was doing was physically attacking a government official (who was actually going to be killed) to his name. <br /> <br /> I could be particularly touchy about this because I work in the automotive industry, but I would say that it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and even racist to suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea; that huge and serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model of this fictitious automobile company, as they are the only existing realities) operate with these mafia methods, rather than as a normal western car company. It is simply unbelievable to me that writers have the courage to write something like this in history, and that there has been no turmoil in Korea for it. It looks foreign "Buy American!" propaganda, which portrays foreign car companies as unreliable, third-world criminal garments.
