This film has a saving feature. At one point, after a character was attacked by an ax wielding an ax, his brother asked him, "Why is your bird there, Chuck?" After suffering for almost an hour of bad film, this almost made my nose go out. <br /> <br /> Some acting is not bad, but the children smell and PJ Soles should be ashamed of herself to make this film. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense) they should. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many points in history that do not add up. For example, in a scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so that they can prove that they exist, a difficult undertaking since they apparently cannot interact with physical matter. However, a few minutes later they pick up branches from the ground and beat the tooth fairy with them. Apparently, sometimes they can move the subject and sometimes they CANNOT. Go figure. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and guts, though ... some nice tits. But this does not compensate for the shortcomings. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie on the Tooth Fairy, go rent "Darkness Falls". I think it's great, although many other reviewers don't share my opinion. At least it puts a mood.
