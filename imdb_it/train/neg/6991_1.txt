Just don't disturb. I thought I would see a film with great underdevelopment and action. <br /> <br /> But it becomes increasingly boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a small social drama and all the tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end, it improves but is not really exceptional. I think the director took this film too seriously. In a genre of movies even if you don't care about the plot, at least you want a nice gesture. I almost dozed off in the central / main part of it. Rating 3/10. <br /> <br /> derboiler.
