Having seen the Behind the Sun men, I imagine I had hoped for an evolution in style and technique to adapt to the larger scale of this film. I was also very interested in seeing someone make a tough fictional story based on the facts of what happened during the most famous Japanese atrocities, but that's not it. This sounds like a mid-low European exploitation film of the 1970s - eg. SS Experiment Camp etc. (perhaps more like Deporting Women of the Special Section actually). Assuming that it has a wider reach and more people running around, but uses the same economic and carefree of many unfortunate non-actors who fall to the sound of absurdly false gunshots, seasoned with the "shock" performed poorly. sequence. The horribly documented documentary is roughly inserted between the scenes so trite that even these real images are robbed of much of their power. Watch the album "The Holocaust" of channel 4 (aired recently (still in progress?), Del 1 n. 2006) for a truly disturbing documentary on the evils of war (with an excellent contextual use of the real movie). This is the kind of treatment that deserves the horror of Nanjing, not this unbridled exploitation junk (a exploitative film better performed than the disrespectful use of the movie would have gone well, but again this is not even a great film of exploitation). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
