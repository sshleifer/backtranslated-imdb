Absolutely ridiculous movie. I live in London and the plot is so poorly researched that it's ridiculous. No one could be terrified in the London underground. In the short span of time it is not in service every night there are maintenance teams that monitor the tracks and carry out repairs, etc. That there are homeless people living down there is equally unlikely. Or that it is even possible to remain closed and not have access to a mobile phone in this day and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst that could happen if someone were there after the last train is that they could be sprayed graffiti on them. Although this has been under control due to the massive number of security cameras on the network, another thorn in the side of the story. (Remember London as a whole we have more security cameras than any other city in the world.) <br /> <br /> Had it been set in a city I don't know, maybe I could have enjoyed it through ignorance, but not it is a high quality film, so I couldn't get myself to suspend disbelief and try to enjoy it for the trivial story it is. <br /> <br /> I would have given him 0/10 if this evaluation existed! Perhaps the most disappointing film I ever thought I'd like.
