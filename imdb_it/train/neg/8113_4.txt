POPEYE AND LARGE FEET **; MOTEY COMPANY POPEYE **; HOW TO GET THE CAPE OF POPEYE ** 1/2 <br /> <br /> I got used to grab them as a child, but I saw an episode of the series that included three cartoons one after the other, that is several years later ( they preceded the theatrical projection of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they do not hold up so well! Popeye's character is not exactly sympathetic at first, Olivia Oyl clearly overbearing and Bluto's antics failed to arouse much interest or ?? in short, the scripts were frighteningly thin, quite horrible and generally not fun to use. They are rigorously young stuff, yet I doubt that today's kids even have the patience to stay with them! moreover, the style of the animation is unattractive. <br /> <br /> Taking every short film by itself, I believe they have improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one has adapted to its mediocre quality, so that the third cartoon turns out to be easily more pleasant than the lot ?? A Popeye has been entrusted with a goat as a military mascot whose immense appetite causes him no end to malice (hardly original, I know, but it is always a fun ploy). An interesting element in this case was the fact that the short films were distributed with Popeye offering pieces of moralistic wisdom to the children of the public.
