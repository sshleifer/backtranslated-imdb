I saw the rating of 7.5 IMDb on this film and based on that I decided to watch this movie that my roommate had rented. He said he saw it earlier. "It's funny and sad! I cried the first time I saw it," he exclaimed. Perhaps compared to other Bollywood films this deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but in comparison to all the other films I've seen in my life, this doesn't deserve more than a 3. Every movie in which I can always assume what will happen after not okay for me The characters are incredible, as the act is not at all realistic and their motivations are invented. It's too dramatic and the songs aren't that great. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and therefore not completely realistic. Any emotion or link between characters that is the least subtle must be amplified with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between father and son was more like one of friends than one between parent and child without having to transmit it through a five minute song. The stupid comic relief complete with laughter was not fun or necessary (we understand it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If a film tries to provoke tears through the most grounded means possible, it is not meaningful, just a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally if someone has terminal lung cancer, the child who lives with them might know that something is not he went without having to say it. Too many holes in the plot to count. In the beginning the film was fun and cute in the way Bollywood movies are aimed at people who don't greedily watch them but it became boring. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is fun and heartbreaking and the best way to do it is usually not to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartbreaking parts at the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Maybe it had a little more depth than the other Bollywood films I've seen, but not much. I spent more time laughing at the stupidity of the movie than the parts that were supposed to be fun. I didn't shed a single tear or feel like it, on the contrary I was overwhelmed by a sense of disgust at the attempt of a dramatic ending. I don't recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to watch a Bollywood movie that is a little sad.
