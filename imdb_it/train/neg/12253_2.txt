I never thought that a film could be so atrocious, but unfortunately I was wrong. Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible effects. The crocodile was horrible and as for the stupid sex / murder scene all in one, it was a bad move from the word "go". It was really shocking and it's not a compliment! How can anyone make this film, look back and then say "Yes, this is a good movie." People will look at him "If you haven't seen him please DO NOT THROW :-(
