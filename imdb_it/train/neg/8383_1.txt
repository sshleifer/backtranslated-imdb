...Never. This is the bottom I'm not kidding. The theater should have had a warning of some sort. 'Give up all hope that you come in here' would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> I don't have the words to accurately describe the hell this film is. His debilitating stupidity can't even amuse. This film is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox. The story was clearly stolen from a 10-minute Bugs Bunny comic and then stretched like Mr. Fantastic to a painfully painful 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I remember when the Wayans were fun. I imagine that Hollywood's pressures for them to produce production products are to blame for the constant poop churning. I am sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of balls in a thin plot based on a cardboard. <br /> <br /> I didn't like most of this movie. I won't ruin anything, but the child is actually a dwarf with the face of Marlon Wayans poorly superimposed on the body of the dwarf. What I liked was the ending. Not the resolution of the film, but the real end in which we all got up and left. <br /> <br /> I gave this film a star, but clearly deserves less. I don't think the six minutes spent writing the script are worth a star. This deserves a Razzie and I pray to God if he gets it. <br /> <br /> When people learn; if you stop paying to see this idiocy, they will stop making fun of it. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid it at all costs. You have been warned.
