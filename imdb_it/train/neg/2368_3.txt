Ok, this is stupid, they say they are not doing another nightmare movie, that this is the last ... And what do they do? They continue to make another one, not that the next one (part 7) is BAD, but why are they playing with it? Anyway this movie didn't make any sense, so it was absolutely stupid, the characters were highly dimensional, Freddy was another joker, which is very stupid for such a good series. The plot is very, very bad, and this is even worse than parts 2 and 5. I didn't take the film, it's a stupid 3-d story, useless! I hated this movie so much that I still remember all the parts I didn't like, which was pretty much the whole movie. This is very different from the prequels, he tries and tries, but this has proved the most difficult, and he has been slapped on the face. How can they have gone so far? Didn't they see that they made the biggest mistakes at parts 2 and 5? Yet do they do this? It's all the money, DON'T SEE THIS DEADLINE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /> <br /> I GAVE A NIGHT ON ELM STREET SEI (6) 3 on 10. <br /> <br /> GOOD POINTS OF THE FILM: I had a potential with the plot. <br /> <br /> FILM BAD POINTS: Terrible acting / lack of deaths / Too funny to be classified as horror / very confusing.
