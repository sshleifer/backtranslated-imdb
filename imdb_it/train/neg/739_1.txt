Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin the first step on the wrong foot, assuming that Wells wrote the Gothic horror and that all his jokes are taken seriously. This is simply not true. Wells was a great heir to the Enlightenment and his main concern was that Victorian complacency could leave the British unprepared for the world that the new technology could produce - both good and evil. <br /> <br /> Two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a skinny chimpanzee (Fay Wray came back to my mind in the original King Kong), rather than a man struggling to experience the ironies of an incredible catastrophe; and the dialogue stinks of "Victorianism" he said seriously that Welles clearly intended to get caught up in the language. <br /> <br /> All this seems suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget to waste on CGI effects - that from the unrealized way the 1940s Warner Bros. cartoon factory could have done a better job . (The drops of splattered blood looked like red balloons, I expected them to fly away every minute.) Think of The Yellow Submarine as done by the old EC comics. <br /> <br /> Worse is the loss of the theme, which steals the film of any reason to exist. Although the creators of this film bring the story back to its Victorian era, they completely lose the uncanny way that Wells' story predicted many of the horrors of World War I - a fact not overlooked by Wells himself, who, after the war, reworked the The theme of The Shape of Things to Come. <br /> <br /> Without any issues, all we have here are a lot of people running around blowing themselves up in cartoon balloons when they're not rehearsing for a high school production of a student rewrite drunk on Macbeth. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is the worst, most senseless piece of drivel I have suffered since a friend told me about seeing the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" thirty years ago. That movie was so pretentiously boring, my friend and I and two strangers stopped making fun of it halfway and sat next to the screen playing cards, using the film as light to see the cards - its only use, like As far as any of us knew. <br /> <br /> But I already have electric lighting in my apartment, so I didn't need this Wells put-down for nothing. <br /> <br /> Do not avoid this movie: steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each one of them. God in his wisdom created us precisely for this purpose.
