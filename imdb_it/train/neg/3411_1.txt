Mix exotic tropical places, girls in skimpy outfits, explosions, beautiful clones of Dudley Do-Right, a movie star with his best years behind him (Martin Sheen), some martial arts and a sexy villain (Tracy Lor. ... .er, sorry ... Tracy ELIZABETH Lords) and you'd think you'd have a little fun. Not like that! This is a sad film for TV and even if he likes to promote himself as a "Charlie's Angels" affair, he is not even close to the original series or even to the stupendous, hopelessly stupid, recent AC movie. This abomination is best described as a movie by Andy Sidaris of TERZO TASSO. It's not even as fun as Andy's "Hard Ticket To Hawaii", although some combat scenes are pretty decent. Girls spend too much time posing and even trying to look good and after a while they get boring. There are things of a better kind than this one out there. Oh yes, and the "girls" aren't as hot as they like to think they are. Terrible soundtrack ... when it's there.
