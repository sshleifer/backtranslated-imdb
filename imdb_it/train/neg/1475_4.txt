Most episodes of season 1 are horrible. There are no comparisons with Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as the programs actually had decent narrative lines. Most of the Amazing Stories are pretty boring ... not surprising at all ... rent or buy the Twilight Zone series ... I hear that Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD, the parts of Ray Walston are cut off, further reducing this compilation. The only interesting thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... Most of the narrative lines are still predictable and the series could be better with twists that left you in doubt ...
