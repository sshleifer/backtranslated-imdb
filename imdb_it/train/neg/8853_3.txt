In the first Ululato, we are introduced to a world in which the werewolves exist and are somehow organized. The plot of that film made sense; a television journalist investigates this and tries to find out the truth. He ends up having to kill many of them including his boyfriend who becomes one. Then show the world that they exist by becoming live TV. The special effects were simply ridiculous in the first film and do not improve in this. Whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the bad computer graphics that show the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The plot is not so bad; they must kill the werewolf leader for some reason. This won't destroy all the werewolves and in reality it doesn't end the threat of the werewolves because ... they just want to kill it. I think there is some reason for this, but it really gets lost in the movie. <br /> <br /> After the film "ends" we have a 10-minute montauge of the movie we have just seen and every other scene is one where the female werewolf boss rips off her top by exposing her large breasts while some Devo-esquire groups play a crowd of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie still watchable is Christopher Lee.
