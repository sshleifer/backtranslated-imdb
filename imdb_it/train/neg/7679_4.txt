Snow White, which has just come out in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, obviously refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coca cola. In the end, even the true snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part. <br /> <br /> So all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There is a lot of drugs on stage, and there is also a girl with dark and pale hair - with a prince who has to face all kinds of problems to come to her rescue. <br /> <br /> Ma: It is not so a fairy tale. It should be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the tagline). <br /> <br /> Technically the film is almost perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, predictable dialogues, a mostly unreal scenario and mixed acting do not add up to create authenticity. So as a spectator I remained intact. <br /> <br /> And then there were the clich√©s, which made me mad one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled daughter of the upper class - obviously her parents are divorced and she never had enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. His best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steel worker and a housewife) live in a tiny, poor and happy apartment - and ignore the desperate situation in which their daughter finds herself. The good boy (= prince) is a musician (!) Of the French-speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be the least economically successful but emotionally most in the form of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who do not seem to accept his wild way of life - until his father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed. <br /> <br /> And so on: Of course, the dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, even if a woman (!), has only his career in mind when he shows Snow White in artistic pornographic images in a show. <br /> <br /> This review does not need a spoiler to allow you to add these pieces to an obvious plot. How I like other Samir films, eg "Forget Baghdad," I was pretty disappointed. We hope for the next one.
