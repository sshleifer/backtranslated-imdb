One of the worst romantic comedies (indeed, the worst movies) I've ever seen. Boy (who works like a psychic phone!) He has to pretend to be gay and move into the apartment with the woman of his dreams. The hilarity does not follow. Boredom, lightness and horrible dialogue do. If you read Brad Meltzer and like his lousy dialogue, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. if you see it, destroy the copy.
