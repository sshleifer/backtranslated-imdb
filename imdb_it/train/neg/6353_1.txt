For a comic writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer turn to this meager attempt at character development. There are some fun moments, but no more than one would have listened to their drying tennis balls. <br /> <br /> Will Ferrell wastes his time in this film that fails to show his usually fun delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, she didn't have the chance to move into this corpse movie. The film is so heavy and boring that it can't be brought, but if it were done, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /> <br /> If you like movies that go back and forth in a scene and really can't achieve anything except to show that their writer can write a few lines of occasional dialogues, then you'll love this movie.
