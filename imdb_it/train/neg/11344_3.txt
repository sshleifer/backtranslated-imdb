I was very impressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but maybe it's worse than both titles. First of all, I didn't like animation, very Saturday-morning-cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some characters, namely Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, like Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was truly evil in the original, but lost its quality in the sequel. What he said was nothing to write home about and his animation was pretty bad. His fellow artist Lars was also a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking during the night. The talents of the voice were very good, especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined him for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed swollen and very suggestive for an extended TV episode. All in all, an extremely disappointing sequel to the most memorable Disney movie of the 60s along with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give you a 3/10, it wasn't my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
