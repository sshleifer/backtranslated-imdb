Note to all the mad scientists around the world: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you have to give him a scarier name than "Paul". I don't care if it's a scary hammerhead shark with a mouth full of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water and on land. Give the boy a more dignified name like "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Because even if he eats me, I'm probably going to laugh there, "Ha! Get a load of this !!! Paul the Monster's ripping me off !!!!!" This is the worst part of this movie, this shark thing is called "Paul" throughout the film. It makes what could have been a decent and scary horror movie, just sounding silly. Not that there are no other campy and contrived parts of "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy". Scientists spend the whole movie wandering around this island, and suddenly one of the girls starts to tremble madly from walking in the lush forest, and only has to pour standing water to relive the itch, which obviously allows "Paul" to come out of the water and kill it. The only thing that SciFI Channel did in this film was to make the bomb live. But that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing film.
