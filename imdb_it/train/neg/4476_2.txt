I just saw this before the MTV movie. I must say that this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue does not explain the story very well, and it seemed to me that there were a lot of holes in the plot. There is no nice character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just found out that all the characters are too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Moreover, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They look more like brother and sister than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof. I saw this movie because of some actors that I respected and appreciated in previous films, but as I said, it's extremely difficult to appreciate any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrendous, which was a complete shock. It was terrible to be Edward's older sister, and there weren't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me to even criticize her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was nice to see him in something recently and even though his character was a bit eccentric, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but it turned out to be whiny and extravagant. <br /> <br /> I didn't really like this movie or the music it contains. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that little look didn't convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job of convincing me that it was a movie that it wasn't. I just imagined something completely different.
