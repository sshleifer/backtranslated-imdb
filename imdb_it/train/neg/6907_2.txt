No artistic writing here because he doesn't deserve it. It is not an art film. Not even one of those "hidden" gems. You know, like those movies you heard about through a friend who saw this amazing film downtown, where they show all the independent and art films. <br /> <br /> Just pack it in the Christmas boxes and dispose of it quickly.
