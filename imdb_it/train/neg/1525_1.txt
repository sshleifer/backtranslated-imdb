I saw it on a weekend afternoon because there was simply nothing else, it would have been more fun to chew and probably less painful. I urge anyone to see it just to see how turgid a film can be, it certainly was intentional. I shuddered at every futile attempt at humor conducted so childishly, unconscious and poorly executed that it was incredible. This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like good guys, I think it's exaggerating? Well, give it the time of transmission and think again. Terrible, absolutely terrible. If this was not a joke, then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and fired promptly after being forced to watch this movie again.
