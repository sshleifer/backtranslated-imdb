I'm not going to give them my $ 10 which I went to buy the fourth season of the original and the best. At least my children have fun and can watch it without worrying about what they are seeing. I have a teenager and she thinks the previews are ridiculous and would rather look at the original. And he thinks that Jessica Simpson is a horrible daisy, in fact she thinks she looks more like a bitch than a daisy. Those shorts might not even wear anything. And since the American Pie has something to do with the Dukes SHAME ON them for putting that ugly line in there to have sex with a car. This in itself should have given the film a R. Score. The only good thing that could come out of this is a film of reunion with the originals. Leave everything to hope. So the people out there who have gone and seen the movie will see how it looks
