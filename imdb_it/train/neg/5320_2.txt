It is a dry and sterile film that takes up one of the most interesting events of the Second World War and the history of the war behind the front line. Bad dramatic composition is the worst thing about this film, as the plot about Hitler's killing is a rather dramatic event. There is no character development at all and the idea that Tom Cruise supposes to play a high-ranking commander who questions his deepest inner thoughts about patriotism and betrayal is completely insane. I think Mr. Bin would have played better. In general, the film looks almost like a copy of the good German TV movie "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but it can't come close to that film as far as any aspect of the film is concerned. However, the film obviously gets its financial goal with a pop-corn audience that cares about the blood of Hollywood and the values ​​of superficial art.
