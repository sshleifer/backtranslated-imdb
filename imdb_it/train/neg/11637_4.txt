Uwe Boll has done the impossible: to create an adaptation of the game that is at least in some way faithful to the game; has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a film full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll that we're dealing with here, so don't expect the film to be valid. while he has his moment, "Postal" exhausts his welcome very quickly and becomes a pain to sit on. <br /> <br /> Inside, Postal is a satire in the United States, as done by a twelve-year-old child. Boll seems to think that the offensive is linearly proportional to the comic value: more offensive, more amusing and more exaggerated is the fun. This translates into a film that sets new levels of blandness despite being extremely inconsistent. Yes, some gags work but it seems to be pure luck. The salient points include the director who takes a bath and people are violently hit by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include .. quite all the rest. <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise vanishes, Postal becomes simply boring to watch. Yes, there is a good joke every ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters who shoot themselves and chase each other everywhere for what seems like an eternity. <br /> <br /> This would probably be I worked as a short film, but it is not content enough for something that lasts more than 90 minutes (even if you hear twice as long). There are good ideas and good proofs, but they are irretrievably lost in endless and useless action scenes and offensive content only for the taste 4/10
