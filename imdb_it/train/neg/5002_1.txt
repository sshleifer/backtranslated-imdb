How has such a terrible script managed to attract this cast? Ridiculous, predictable and absolutely incredible, this is well done and direct, but the material is so bad that it still qualifies as one of the worst thrillers of all time I've seen in years. Incredibly bad, and not funny. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a fan of someone in the cast.
