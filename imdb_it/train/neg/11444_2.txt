SNL is pretty funny, but people who say it's like watching a Short Skit on SNL is a bit dull. Nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to behave like Jon Heder but fails. Although Jon Heder is funny only in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy does his best and people think it's fun. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the film were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was definitely fun with Andy was the pool part. <br /> <br /> They could have made the "quiet place" so much better if they didn't drop the scene 3 cold minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he is pronouncing his H is more delayed. They try to go with them too long and for half the time it seems that Andy is laughing while acting ... he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for simple-minded people with the brains of a comedy level of 10 years. Which is about half of the United States.
