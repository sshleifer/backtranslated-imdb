how can this film have a 5.5 this film was a piece of skunk s ** t. before the actors were really bad, I mean the chainsaw that Charlie was so retarded. because in the beginning just when he put his head in the wooden hut (which was about a quarter of an inch thick (which was really cheap as a * fragile piece of wood) and he didn't even think he could throw it) person who made the set sucks like * in providing things for them to build with. the only positive thing about this film is the idea of ​​this t.v. to exhibit. bottom line DON'T waste your hard earned money on this piece of what they call a movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
