The title should have been the walker. The boy spends 90% of the film on foot. He doesn't know what he wants, or what he is. Cross life by stealing people's identity for nothing. It gets no benefit, no money, nothing that pretends to be another person. <br /> <br /> No body was able to understand why it was pretending to be someone else. <br /> <br /> The only thing that was clear in this film that he loved his father and was a good son. But the rest was bad. <br /> <br /> The director could be a loser who would like to be someone else. But what he really should do is get a real job, because after his movie, I don't think he has a chance to do as a film producer.
