The only redeeming quality of this film is the real plot ... Otherwise, this film was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set set was poor and very vulgar. The story was decent, but it was very difficult to watch due to all the horrible acting. I wouldn't recommend looking at this ... The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the actors were quite attractive ... especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. Some changes have been well done, but there are errors of continuity everywhere ... I'm starting to feel sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we have a good one soon?
