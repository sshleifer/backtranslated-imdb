My thoughts on the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It wasn't good, not good at all. Visually, it was fantastic. I was pleased with the rhythm, camera angles, etc. However, the characters? eh, a little bland. To track? He sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie looked more like a new age crap than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and fearful. Science is not better described. Create a monstrous weapon that kills everything ... but the "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's something that even bites my ass. Here we have a movie in CGI ... created with science ... and are they using it to give us the message that science will destroy the world by promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had the decency to ask one of the characters, <br /> <br /> "Okay, so now?" (or something similar). I couldn't hear him too well because the crowd immediately stands up and pauses for the exit. It was "ok ... it was just fun enough to sit here for the whole movie, but now let's get out of here as fast as possible!" type of exit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can't think of if you want to enjoy it. Look at the pictures and nod gently. Any thoughts on "what's the point of this?" it will suck you for disbelief and make you look at the exit sign with desire. <br /> <br /> Ok ... follow the SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> So, in essence, a scientist creates "the Machine" is capable of creating another intelligent, robotic life. Bad humans use it as a weapon. However, the scientist understands that he too is at fault. He gave the Machine his intellect, but he did not give him his heart. <br /> <br /> The Car goes to Skynet on the collective ass of humanity and sweeps away all life on earth, finally slowly extinguishing. However, the scientist manages to survive and create puppets on foot. Each one containing a piece of the soul of the scientist. <br /> <br /> The last, n. 9 wakes up not knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange device nearby and picks it up. He meets with another like him, # 2. <br /> <br /> Well, # 2 is captured by a last surviving robot of the Machine. # 9 finds more like itself and gets to safety to save # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 note that there is a corresponding hole that fits the device perfectly. He inserts it and the Machine returns to life ... extracting the soul of n. 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The film then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to save his countrymen torn from the soul. <br /> <br /> Finally they succeed and destroy the Machine. They release the souls of their fallen friends, who climb into the clouds. Then it rains and we see life return to the planet. <br /> <br /> Hunh?!? <br /> <br /> It doesn't make sense. No one at all. Why the hell did the scientist want to divide his soul into 9 little men? What did you do? Were they created to stop the car? Everything is dead! The car was dead! Why worry?!? <br /> <br /> Why did you expect nine little creatures to succeed when nothing else was? Why not create a second intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first ... at least it would have seemed like it would have had a reasonable chance of success. <br /> <br /> Why did their souls get sucked into the device by the Machine and then destroy the Machine and then release the souls to bring life back to Earth? Why not wait for the car to turn off and bring life back without all the other crazy passages?
