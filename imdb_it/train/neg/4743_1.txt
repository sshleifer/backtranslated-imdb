I'm back here in your local mall (obviously, because that's where high school kids stop !!!!!) to show how horrible "BENDY POO: PROM COURIER" !!!!! To show how bad this DCOM joke is, this is ... <br /> <br /> ... we'll take these four sumo wrestlers and put them in this photo booth. How ... welcoming !!!!! <br /> <br /> Hai! Huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Uh !!!!! <br /> <br /> How scary is that ????? It's so bad, Disney Channel empties its money once again with those exciting but crucial 10 second promos, keeping viewers wondering, "WHEN THIS IS GOING TO BE ?????" And then, suddenly, when it turns on, for example, this not only got a higher TV score than usual, but this was only seen once !!!!! Oh, no !!!!! Once all !!!!! Moreover, this film is about high school and things like that, and believe me, I will NOT go further with what's inside ..... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
