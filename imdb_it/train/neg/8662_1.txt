What a horrible movie. I love monster movies, but I couldn't watch even half of the terrible acting, the cardboard characters and the abysmal special effects. There is nothing saving in this film. The characters come from an endless supply of cannon-foolish cannon fodder or empty and uninspiring puppets. The plot is formidable, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drivel. Even the CGI is horrible. You know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to give it some taste. No surprise here, just the same old old man. This is truly one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should be hanging from a marker so that children can use it as a pinata.
