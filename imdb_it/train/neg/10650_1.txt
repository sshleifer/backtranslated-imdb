This film is without doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that says a lot, considering I've seen similar smezzons like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). Anyway, I love ugly horror movies, and as you can see from my username, this really stands out. Sometimes there's nothing more fun than a badly made slasher movie. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman fries in a tanning booth seems to have no connection with the film, especially since the film cannot tell you that the event happened 2 years before the rest of the movie. The acting is non-existent, and most of the shots are of female areas wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the monotonous and stone-faced actor I have ever seen. The best / worst part of this film, however, must be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin ?! What were they thinking? Who is the murderer? A disgruntled "Huggies" employee? I should give this movie a general zero, but damn if I didn't enjoy watching it
