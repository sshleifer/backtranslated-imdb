What a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> It starts well with the title sequence, but this is the best you can get. <br /> <br /> The film is something about mice that become monsters and go on a murderous binge. The acting is not so poor, but the script is useless and the film is not even scary despite the atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> It's really amazing that some bands put together this garbage bag and thought it would be a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's rubbish, and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life! One in ten.
