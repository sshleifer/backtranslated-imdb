Many other reviewers here, including many whose opinions respect, hold this slice of European horror in high regard. Personally, I didn't like it at all. It is an inconsistent attempt at a transverse atmospheric time between sex and violence. Jess Franco at his best makes this kind of film very well. Unfortunately, the infamous exploitation director Joe D'Amato does not. D'Amato's best known films are notorious for their high gross quotient. This, his first film, does not have the disgusting and constant scenes that made his most famous "Anthropophagous" and "Beyond the darkness". Ultimately, it is an inconsistent film that fails to engage the viewer in any way. Even without the sleaze, it becomes very boring. Like I said, others have enjoyed this movie, but I just found a perfect example of incredibly lazy writing. <br /> <br /> There are some advantages to the film. Ewa Aulin (from "Candy") is inside, and looks pretty hot and is often naked. However, the icon of the cult movie Klaus Kinski is completely wasted in a subplot with no connection to the main film. He looks bored with the role and doesn't have the manic intensity he does best. The soundtrack is beautiful and there are some short moments of involuntarily funny gore. Still, this is a pretentious and useless film that manages to be incredibly boring. (3/10)
