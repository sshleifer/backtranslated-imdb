This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. His lack of subtlety and complexity and his total political correction make him really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like that, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I hate most about this film is Bola's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: shaved-headed tattooists are not always bad, in fact they can be better than a normal-looking dad (wow, this is like ... philosophy, or something). Thank you, Achero. I will propose you for the Nobel prize for literature.
