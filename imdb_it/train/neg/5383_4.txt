I think I should start by saying that almost every work style can be fun in some parts. The real test is if it's good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analogue title for this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me who like to read a lot of blogs - that blogs can't be compared to a good novel written for a variety of reasons. Similarly, the EMF cannot be compared to good film production for a variety of reasons, and in fact I believe it is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a combined vlog. (Hell, MySpace also gets a bit of pimp.) If I wanted to see an hour of solitaire15 - I wouldn't do it - I'd go see it. FEM, although certainly more aggressive than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. It's like looking at the worldliness of life, which I think most would agree on is very naturally boring. Yet the creators of FEM want us to applaud, their postmodern film about making a film. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I come away not paying any attention to any of this. I'm shocked that I'm actually interested in taking time to write this review, too. It is not that the FEM is decidedly negative, because it is not; there are some moments when I create a smile or I think that maybe - just maybe - something is going to happen. It is rather that it is simply ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent that it's almost an oxymoron: a passionate indifference. I hope the creators / "actors" of the film will free themselves from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them moves and goes on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste and don't want to do much; otherwise pass it and don't worry about having lost some great talent to discover. You really didn't.
