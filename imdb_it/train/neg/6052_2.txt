Despite its flaws, I enjoyed "Cigarette Burns", the episode of John Carpenter Season One in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed an economic cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still good enough for the budget and the time limits that were assigned to it. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time limits certainly prove more than anything else. There is always a solid direction as always from Carpenter, but there is a quality in writing and all the production itself that gives the feeling that it has been made completely and completely. The script is not always clear, the message is confused and the plot is full of holes in the plot once you look back at them. Maybe Carpenter rewrote the script, it may have been an interesting episode. Instead, it's a mess that only the most ardent Carpenter fans will find the least fun. Definitely the worst carpenter I've ever done. 2/10
