The dubbing / translation in this film is definitely exhilarating and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise boring and derived zombie movie. I didn't laugh so much in my life as I just saw Zombi 3 (and I saw some bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, filmmakers could re-edit this film and publish it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. It's just so fun. <br /> <br /> But ... If falling off your couch laughing at dubbing a Fulci zombie movie is not your cup of tea, then AVOID THIS at all costs.
