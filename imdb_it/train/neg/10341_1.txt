I rented this film from the library (it's hard to find it for good reason) just out of curiosity. I'm a big Plath fan and this film was a complete disappointment. The Bell Jar (1979) is by far one of the worst films I've ever seen. The script is horrible, not because it departs from the original text of the novel, but because it moves away without concentration or intention. The scenes are poorly constructed and do not lead the viewer anywhere. What is with the hockey voice on Plath's poetry? Lady Lazarus has little to do with the Greenwood situation; Plath's poetry was completely abused. Marilyn Hassett is absolutely amazing as Esther Greenwood (or a 20-year-old of this kind) partly because of the casting (she was 32 during filming, the age when Plath was dead) and partly because she couldn't act . Hassett is all emotion, no skill, no skill. The direction is mediocre; the director simply covers what's there, which isn't much. The only reason I'm giving a 1 movie is because 0 is not an option. Sorry Sylvia, you'll have to wait for someone else to take your refined work into something more appropriate.
