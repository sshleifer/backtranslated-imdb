you can say that they spent 5 $ making this.it is a waste of your time ... ugh .. there is nothing remotely good about this movie ... .. I don't know why I kept watching it .. the il chick is not hot horrible acting .. you could do anything and it is a better use of your time .. like watching tv playing shit video games .. i feel robbed. simply robbed .. of my time. I have never done a review for a film earlier than you can probably tell but this film seemed to me to need to save the poor souls who are going to watch it and watch it on IMDb before seeing if it's decent and watching the comments. -There was no action- -no hot dumplings- -not budget- -shittttttttttttttty acting- shouts ugly movies. **** the WHOLE film is in a room. ***
