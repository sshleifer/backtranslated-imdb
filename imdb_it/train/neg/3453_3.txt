It seems that the IMDb reviews of this film have been more in-depth than those of the source. <br /> <br /> Here is an unpretentious review: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing will happen, it doesn't happen. <br /> <br /> Dress him the way you like, this is a boring film, full of non-engaging characters that make very little interest. <br /> <br /> One to put if you want to convince an emotional emotional girl that you're kind, so deep, man. <br /> <br /> It is not something to look at for your pleasure though. <br /> <br /> Salvo. <br /> <br /> Six. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
