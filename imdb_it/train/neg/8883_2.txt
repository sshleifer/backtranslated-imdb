Cliff Robertson, an intriguing husband married to a rich wife, offers a performance worthy of raids here if ever there was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling "dial-down, think zombies, just less lively" through his little megaphone while instructing Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of the fame of LOGAN'S RUN is hardly seen in what should have been a fundamental role. If the acting quality was three times better; if some of the more open weft holes had been filled; and if the pace has been given a dose of adrenaline, then this yawn could be brought to an acceptable standard for the public Hallmark Lifetime TV channel. As it stands, his assessment is so inexplicably high that one cannot help but think that chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to take some time to doze. Perhaps late-night television telemarketing lacks an important opportunity to keep it from breaking out as such.
