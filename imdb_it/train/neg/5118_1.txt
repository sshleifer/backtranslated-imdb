I am a Christian and I say that this film had a terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity. You could also watch "Remember the Titans" and at least not mix Christ in a soccer film as a steroid for the losers. Allow me to make some really pressing comments about what has bothered me in this film. <br /> <br /> 1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academic school. I didn't notice a single student or black player in the school. I deal with the white "Christian" academies in the south and have been built for no other reason than to re-establish segregation. This is worrisome when the film talks about Christianity and Christ changing lives ... how about changing the heart of segregation? (note: I really liked the token black coach, as if he were compensating for the completely white team and all the "Giants" players). <br /> <br /> 2. The uncritical praise of all Christians regarding this film. I can convince a couple of people to say that it was bad acting, bad footage, bad writing and, in short, poor quality compared to other films. If we were to compare it to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /> <br /> 3. Half-baked Christianity that was shown to me seemed even less sensible than the unrealistic end. If Christianity simply involves reading a small passage from the Scriptures and praying to begin a complete change of life, then don't be surprised when no one will hear what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a panacea. It does not need to be sold and does not need to be attached to these extravagant lifestyles. No wonder everyone sees anti-intellectual Christianity with this unreal presentation. <br /> <br /> I recognize that this film can be a source of inspiration for some people. For the most part, it will not be. It will not give a real image of struggle and heartfelt tension. Especially for me, he is not a Christian by any means or effort. It has values ​​but is not up to a message "pull yourself up" as a positive thought. If you live alongside people who struggle and / or live in third world living conditions, this film will be as empty as most churches are today in their religion.
