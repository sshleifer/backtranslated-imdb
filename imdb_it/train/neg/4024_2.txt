This film is simply terrible. Poor John Savage had to stoop so low to be in another movie. It is a rare type of vampire who helps a lady who seems to be destroyed and who throws her into the streets like a dancer in a local strip club. Sharply savor a drop of blood from another dancer who appears to be one of those rare vampires as they are dragged and shuttled on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare breed of vampire that looks like a cross between 80s punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This film gets really crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a dwarf with a spider tattooed on his head, even one of the rare. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This only becomes redicule. And then the coarser special effects that could come out is Run that pulls up his organs and pulls them out of his mouth. And you can say that it's all to be faked. His son does not know what to do with the new identity of his mothers and becomes more of a plague than an object of serenity. I like a good vampire movie, believe me, but I just hated this. Even the photo stinks, inside and outside it is confused with the camera that changes in this way and the one that tries to make it seem that the vampires move quickly to keep the camera up and then the camera becomes all bright in the scene of Savage that chases Corri's son until he blinds himself. Avoid this !!
