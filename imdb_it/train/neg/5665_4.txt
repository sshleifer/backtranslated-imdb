This voluntarily bizarre adaptation of Borges's story is typical of Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, nullified by the terrifying acting in the middle of most of the cast. The film is certainly in the surreal tradition of the Mexican period of Bunuel, and sometimes seems like the version of a poor man from Elements of Crime by Lars Von Trier. Cox's apparent preference for single shots, jumps and environmental sound recording all work against the effectiveness of the film. It is worth a look but ultimately disappointing.
