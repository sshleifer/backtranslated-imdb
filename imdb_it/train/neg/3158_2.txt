This was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is sexy, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely horrible in the whole movie, her hair is so bad! They speak like monotonous voices and there is no chemistry. The DVD cover doesn't even come close to what the movie really is. Really, really boring. I had to speed up in part because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know why would I think this is good? Hhaha literally are like talking and saying "yes" and there is no passion. I couldn't say at all that they were in love. I'm sorry, but this was the saddest excuse for a film I think I've ever seen.
