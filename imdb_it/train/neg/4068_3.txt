With such a title, it is above and beyond my understanding of how this film has never pleased me. Sure, there are some faintly dull and a bit gore moments, but the way the film was shot and the general plot struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at deep "shock" tactics ... The inconsistent plot begins with a boy who rapes and kills a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his brother brother are imprisoned until his brother breaks out and organizes to meet his girlfriend in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they fuck and later shows her a collection of boys kidnapped in the basement. The heavily drugged prisoners consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "distressed" neighbor and his sexually irritating boss. He explains that he will kill them all. It ends up killing him and then focusing his attention on the men (or pigs) who torture and kill, himself ... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with food and the destruction of the genitals - which are all far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic manipulation masturbation followed by a painful rape ... Surely, "I Spit on Your Corpse, IP! Ss on Your Grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "I Spit on Your Grave" - ​​based , mainly on the title, and a reference given by the main character, which suggests that his mother was Camille Keaton. I personally think it's a wildly blasphemous statement! This film is a boring and amateur mess that tries to shake but fails miserably ...
