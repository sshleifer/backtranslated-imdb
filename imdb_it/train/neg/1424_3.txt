The film starts well with an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introduces two very nice side characters in the first half. But something happens later and suddenly Shannon turns into a second-hand bad girl with a straight face and the film gets lost in its context. The second half is devoid of any kind of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad acting, horrible plot and even worse coordination of stunts. Not to mention the horrible actors they chose for the Chechen mafia band. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter overcomes him making an even greater embarrassment than the double that he played Bruce Lee back then. I truly believe that you can do much better than this and I hope you participate in a better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a true action fan and don't care about quality, go ahead and watch this movie. I couldn't wait to do it but I was terribly disappointed.
