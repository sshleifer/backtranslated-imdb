this movie really tries hard. if you're going to make a horror movie, at least give it a reason to believe you're hooking the viewer. <br /> <br /> wait and wait for the film to expect a great explanation, but it is not. instead it tries to be a too intelligent ending and not to reveal anything. <br /> <br /> what was the point of the film? Where is he going? and above all what the hell was happening. . . <br /> <br /> why were they there and how does it relate to something? just another weak science fiction horror. I like fake reviews on IMDb that say it's great for press releases related to the movie (or that or people have low horizons). not worth 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I am not saying that the film is better than fragile, but at least this has proved you right and because things have gone and has a final result. this doesn't work and just waffle's with tons of padding to make everything scary. this movie is more or less like when a stranger calls. God was also lame. <br /> <br /> great advice, if you make a horror, make it credible with reasoning and explain to the viewer what's going on, so they have a hook in your story. because if there is no reasoning or credibility, there is nothing rigid about anything and it cannot be scary. Don't disrespect the cast or crew because they have done a good job. it's just poor writing.
