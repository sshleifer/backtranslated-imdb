Another pedantic quickie of grade Z of the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson's 13-inch Clint Eastwood cop from outer space chases a bad head (!) On Earth and gets involved in a gang war in the South Bronx! Quite merciful, but incredibly boring, with the most bloody effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should also have fired the continuity boy: Notice how Thomerson's sunglasses disappear and reappear in every second shot. Laughably bad, but that's why we watch these movies, right? Sequel'Dollman Vs. Reportedly, Demonic Toys is even worse, if possible. <br /> <br /> 0 (of ****) <br /> <br />
