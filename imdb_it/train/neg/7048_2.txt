I chose this film for the cover which was a bad move. It was not funny at all and the main characters were nasty. The girl was beautiful but the story and the acting were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Terrible movie with a surf "theme" that has nothing to do with surfing and no real surfer. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the film will probably see a renaissance just because it is now in the spotlight, being married to Gordon Gekko and everyone, but if you haven't seen her, don't waste time. A bad movie with a great surf, real surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinematography was IN THE HANDS OF GOD.
