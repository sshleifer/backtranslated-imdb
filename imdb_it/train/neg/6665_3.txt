OK, the story - a naive madman enters a life of young cops bored to death and his little brother and blows up their lives - is slightly interesting. However, ideas are nothing (everyone has ...) - execution is everything. <br /> <br /> This is what annoyed me with this movie. And it annoyed me immensely. The rhythm (direction, editing) was slow, the rhythm was irregular and the climax expected. We've seen those rude highways five, six, seven times - why? The problems of Norton's character were seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / blah and to cheer for or against him. Is he a coward, a manipulator or just a fool? The references to the "Taxi Driver" were ridiculous and useless and certainly not favorable for this film (or for E.N.). <br /> <br /> AND IMHO, in the end it is cowardly executed. Low-cost emotional tricks for teen lovers somewhere in Central America. This boy was supposed to kill the child, blame his father, create a real disaster. Either the child should have killed the father in the end, etc., But no, we have finished the cheesy where the boys miss the fool, the father is perplexed about his life and the relationship with them and the fool obviously dies. The happy dysfunctional family remains unscathed, safe and happily bored again so they can enjoy our undisturbed popcorn. <br /> <br /> And that scene where the madman enters the movie, oh my God, I should think long and hard to find something more stupid than this! No such scene with a hidden camera and a hidden team is filmed. The creators of that film probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you're a 16-year-old girl somewhere in Kansas or anywhere else - where and dreams of having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you could enjoy this movie and its "message" .
