Describing this film as garbage is unfair. Rooting through waste can be an engaging hobby. This film was neither engaging nor fun. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act superbly, given the opportunity, so he undoubtedly had an IRS account to settle when he accepted this dramatic script. The story of the mad scientist of 'Hollow Man' was told earlier, told better, and told without resorting to so many incredibly expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men, women and dogs that you could buy in the early seventies. In the UK they were marketed as "The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)", which is perhaps where they got the title for this film. <br /> <br /> Smart special effects, terrible script, non-existent storyline. <br /> <br />
