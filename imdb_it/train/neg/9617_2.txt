Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls off a boat and drowns. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop beating herself and take the blame for something she didn't control. So take the infusion and something to chew and go back to the same lake that was in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two friends are splashed before they even go to the party. This film has the feeling of a school play in which everyone has forgotten their lines and "winged it" ... very bad! The writer Marcos Gabriel has given himself the meatier role of Rachel's boyfriend, Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some rather limping acting and some characters that you would like to choke before they are "off". Paying attention to some other players who had the courage to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a MEMORIAL DAY that you wouldn't mind losing.
