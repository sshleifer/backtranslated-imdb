The film is about two brothers who should be equal - but in no way expect to be intelligent - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. Genes as they prefer to call themselves that sounds very exaggerated if you compare it with personal characteristics you can perceive from the title material. <br /> <br /> I honestly didn't like the style of the film. I believe that the anxiety, confusion and deep blues that it brings are there for a purpose, but what I don't understand is why there's so much. The film is cheap on the scenes and tells the story with virtually no human aspect. It gives the comic a similar experience. However it is visually paralyzing the viewer, somehow takes him inside the blues with short dialogues, monotonous scenes, dynamic cut, music and sudden noises. <br /> <br /> The film's plot is very simple, most of what is happening is being dramatically represented for long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium that simulates effects of drug use and dynamic cuts . I will say openly that this film did not meet my expectations a little.
