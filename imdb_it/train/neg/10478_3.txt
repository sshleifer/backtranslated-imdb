I sincerely consider this film as another scarce effort by the Dominican film industry. The first 30 minutes of the film are a bit funny, but then when they change their role in society (men do what women and women usually do what men usually do) the movie falls. Becoming boring and not at all funny. They leave many things without explanation and the end of the film is predictable. I don't like how Roberto Angel played his character and even his little one. I went to the theater in the theater hoping to see a good job but I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
