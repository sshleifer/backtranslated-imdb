If you want to make a film like this, make the threat real. Don't surround your mouth with a pile of Bonzo. There is no credibility here. The plot is boring and incredible. Acting is even worse. I thought I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood) which is one of the worst actors in history when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he has to face the music and fight. I don't care. Do? There are all these long scenes set in this austere office (the furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk, smoke and do nothing. Most actions take place in a five-minute sequence. After that, it's over. Do not worry
