A study in evil. Bad acting, bad music, bad script, bad tinkering, bad direction and bad idea. The schlock pieces are never more acclaimed or unintentionally more fun than this ... thing. At the end of the "movie", you wonder why they took the trouble. Poor Malcolm McDowell, was he short of money or something? Are you still thinking of seeing it? * SPOILERS AHOY *: If you have not died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, for the moment you will see the cyborg populated city called "Cytown", you will. Avoid this, my movie-loving friends. To avoid.
