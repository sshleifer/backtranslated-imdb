Where do I start? For the title of this film I was expecting a certain degree of authenticity, in the end I was severely disappointed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, rather it is a Hollywood story (or choose your movie that acts as a hub) freely inspired by some real-life characters. I should have had the slightest idea when I heard a strong English accent giving the intro to the film in German; the red blood text (title, artists) should have been the second clue. The plot is invented (Lale was not deceived by Rolf Liebermann's parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped to smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song was recorded outside the control of the NS regime not while it was under control, the record played at the station was picked up in Vienna while a lieutenant was there on leave, etc. etc.) the costumes are poor and incorrect for the times (the black uniforms of the SS used everywhere from border guards to staff positions, these are go away everyday use once the war started, etc.), the characters are stereo type (the SA bullies in a club once they were basically without energy). Do not waste time.
