Geez, as a gay man who lives in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the weak spot of gay culture that is portrayed in this film - and I'm happy about it !!! If this film were broadcast on TV throughout the United States, there would have been a big anti-gay reaction and I can't say I would blame them. The people in this film do not represent the average American gay or even the American average of Trandgender, what they represent represent a pure and simple nightmare. The inclusion of obviously underage characters is terrifying and the obvious racist (anti-white) feelings are blatant and disturbing: society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs, unemployment and the refusal of education by the "cast" film - the actions of these people are not acts of desperation, but rather a rejection of something that resembles personal ambition and the will to do something out of itself.
