I'm so disappointed. This film made me feel frustrated by my time and my mental energy. Here is the quintessential Woody Allen film again: the bourgeois bourgeois bourgeois who discuss whether or not they want to betray their spouses. Woody, I've seen these characters before, I've seen the plot ten times already. Where did your creativity go ??? You have to open your eyes and look around. The world has changed radically from Annie Hall - and you have to change it. <br /> <br /> There are much more interesting and fun scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism - why not try them out instead of modernizing the same old whore over and over again. <br /> <br /> When I hear that Woody Allen has a new project coming out, it does nothing for me - because now I expect his old wait: the couple that is getting tired of each other and ends up cheating. Depressed and the same old, same old man. <br /> <br /> If Woody wants to win back his fans, then he must understand that our sense of humor and intelligence must be stimulated - not insulted.
