OK, so it was written in 1996, before September 11th, so you can give him some credit for the concern for the terrorists and the idea that the CIA director is doing a plot to blow up this doomed plan before that brings destiny to the world, is prescient. That's all. This is the good stuff. Acting ... fair. The plot ... silly. The "twist" ... useless. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It's not like anyone has ever thought about what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for "sores" and how to contain them? The correct execution of this plan is always a problem, as we have seen after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not to send them to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the aircraft door opened and the "shooters" remained unprotected? Actually, did anyone ever shoot their legs? I'm a sucker, I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it, but it was a waste of time, and for the most part predictable, I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads , it was an advantage, it's a good example of why I watch so little TV network. Rubbish.
