Not that I was really surprised ... movies are never as good as the books they came from. I couldn't wait to see this movie because this is one of my favorite books, even though I knew it probably would have sucked. I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. However, they strayed too far from the plot of the book, and the film version did not convey how horrible this house was. The end was different too. Lara Flynn Boyle looked terrible due to bad cosmetic surgery. The acting was at best insignificant. Perhaps if a theatrical version had been made so that they would not remain so long in Lifetime's "made for TV movie" box, it would be a better film. If you've seen this movie, I strongly encourage you to find the book and read it. I doubt you will be disappointed and I hope you like it as much as I do every time I read it.
