We have a lake. We have an animated storm that crashes. We have a stop-motion killer dinosaur with fins. Okay, let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots call Arnie and Mitch to define the definitive definition of "comic relief". We also had a sheriff who really doesn't do anything wrong with this movie and nobody listens to it. Aw crap, we ended up in the middle of the movie and forgot to put in a bad guy! Don't worry, let's introduce a boy with a mustache, let him steal a shop to indicate that he is a bad boy, then make him appear somewhere near the lake, let him chase him through the woods and all this for the sole purpose of ending up as a dinosaur snack. It should work. <br /> <br /> A complete and clumsy mess, this movie. His logic distorts your mind to make you laugh. The first film with Dave Allen as "stop motion supervisor". After this, he joined forces with the Charles Band for several years until the mid-1990s, when Band ran out of money to pay it, I guess. The effects of the dinosaurs are fascinating and the whole movie is damn involuntarily funny. Unfortunately, this is the only good thing that can be said for this. <br /> <br /> Good wickedness? Yes. The logic of mind bending in fiction should be reason enough to put it on the list. Otherwise, Arnie and Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
