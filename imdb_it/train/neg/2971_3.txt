Batman Mystery of the Batwoman, is, in a word, stale. <br /> <br /> The plot tells that a mysterious female vigilante ("Batwoman") is invading the Batman camp, and while Batman is trying to fight a trio Penguin / Bane / Rupert Thorne, he is trying to figure out who is mysterious Batwoman. <br /> <br /> There is nothing absolutely wrong with this, but there is nothing really special about this, noting that it was really pointed out. <br /> <br /> Mask of the Phantasm has long lost Bruce's love and mingles with his head. <br /> <br /> Subzero was an important event in Mr Freeze's life. <br /> <br /> The Batman movie Beyond, Return of the Joker, also dug deep with the characters involved. <br /> <br /> But Mystery of the Batwoman had some minor subplots, lots of formulas spiced up by a mediocre set on a cruise boat. Frankly, this thing is more Scooby Doo than Dark Knight, lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in its maximum.
