The finale of Weissmuller Tarzan's films is rather weak. There are some things that derail this movie. <br /> <br /> First, Tarzan spends most of the film wearing floppy sandals. In my opinion, any shoe on Tarzan, whether it is sandals or boots as sometimes depicted, is taken off the character, which should be anti-civilization and pro-jungle. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the character of Benji, as mentioned in a previous post, totally derails the film like the comic strip. For me, his character is not necessary for the film's plot. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, while Weissmuller still cuts a command figure like Tarzan, it is clear that he was not in his best form. Although in his latest Jungle Jim films, his physique was a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> The Octopus Battle is a fantastic idea, but I think it should have been done in a previous Weissmuller film when it was at its physical peak. Likewise, the battle, which takes only 30 seconds at the top, would be much more thrilling if it were taken from 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic battle of the giant crocodiles to Tarzan and his companion. <br /> <br /> And while Brenda Joyce in the role of Jane and Linda Christian in the role of Mara are extraordinarily pleasing to the eye, she can't save this last Weissmuller film - a disappointing ending for a great run of characters.
