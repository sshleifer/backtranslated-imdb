Jane Russell turned out to be a delightful musical comedy in the equally titled "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" ?? but unfortunately this film wastes those skills. There is a budget and a nice photo of Paris, but the film does not work. Mrs. Russell seems to play Marilyn Monroe. This does not allow anyone to adequately interpret Jane Russell. Some of the other players are WAYs out of their element. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; most of all, be warned: there is a musical number in which African cannibals with bony heads "cook" the brunettes in a pot, after Alan Young sings in a gorilla dress. <br /> <br /> It is interesting, sometimes embarrassing, to waste resources. <br /> <br /> *** Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
