Poorly structured, poorly written, loaded with clich√©s and flat dialogues. Not a single scene shines. Actors struggle with a painfully boring scenario that manages to completely avoid surprises, twists and conflicts. You know where it's going from the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For a film set in New York, it has almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other independent films that manage to make you look magical on a tight budget. This looks like it was shot in Toronto. <br /> <br /> If you cast Natasha Henstridge, why dress her with loose sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and sad? Where is the attraction? I felt like I was watching a secondary Christian movie of the week in which he was so sexless and moralistic. The great success of Steven Feder is that he convinced people to make this bland film.
