And a self-admitted one for starting. At one point the doctor's assistant refers to himself as Igor. <br /> <br /> Working with the increasingly plausible idea that computers can be used to replace or reconstruct brain function, this film does not devote enough time to exploring the premise. Most of the time on the screen is split between the internal struggle of the coma girlfriend and the hunt for the brain donor murderer. It tries to be a science fiction / thriller / thriller movie but fails to deliver any of the three. <br /> <br /> As a remake of Frankenstein, this is missing everything that made the original good. No one calls the crazy doctor or even threatens to kick him out of the hospital. The scene of the transformation consists of a coma victim who opens an eye and the fantastic computer that makes it happen is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go wrong there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about who the killer might be is destroyed by progressively showing it in the same room with all possible suspects. Finding the killer is as easy as opening a file and interviewing a person. <br /> <br /> San Francisco as a setting is both overused and underused. The opening sequence hits the spot that this is happening in SF, a cable car plays a significant role, the cables live in a Victorian on the hill, Pier 39 makes an appearance, and the final showdown takes place at Golden Gate Park. More specifically ten feet from the cliff side to the park - just enough to keep the bridge in the picture at all times. Once the obvious bases of the scenario are rounded, no other attempt is made to explore the city. <br /> <br /> Acting is the only thing that saves here. Keir Dullea shows a good range and brings out a couple of genuinely exciting scenes. Suzanna Love portrays the recovery from a coma well. Tony Curtis only gets a handful of jokes and the devil's double looks with most of the Frankenscience explained by his assistant. The little blond child hits his signals quite well. <br /> <br /> I also gave him an extra star for the scene where the husband drives south of the bridge, cuts to a U-turn in an unrelated parking lot, and then immediately returns to the bridge driving towards north. It takes quite a bit of everything - courage, ignorance, deadlines - to try to slip the one from the viewer during the only car chase.
