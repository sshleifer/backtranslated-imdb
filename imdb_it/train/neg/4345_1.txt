Misleading advertising ... I saw an advertising spot for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power stating "From the producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way" GET DIRECTLY ... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was "assistant to the editing of the room" Scarface. Not to take away Bergman's talent ... but in my opinion he should have had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say ... We hate being lied to in a big way. As for the film, he was poor at best. I thought Puff Daddy did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be ashamed to work on this film. Overall this film has not done a good job filling the spaces for Carlito's Way. It is obvious that this project was an attempt to make a fast buck rather than a good movie.
