As I said, the book was pretty good and this could have been a good movie if Melissa Gilbert hadn't been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead role. What kind of accent was he supposed to be anyway? It looked like his horrible Russian accent in another movie where I had seen it. Every time he opened his mouth, I felt a little shivering. It took 3 attempts before I could see the whole movie. Brad Johnson was as good as the other protagonist. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the beach scenes. They added a bit of brightness necessary to divert the mind from Melissa Gilberts who depressed the portrait. I think they could have used the views of San Francisco more to their advantage though. It seemed like the night scenes were actually SF, but I could be wrong. I don't remember the character of the book being depressing. <br /> <br /> Keep Melissa Gilbert out of any future film that requires an accent!
