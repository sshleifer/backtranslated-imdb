First of all, let's take a few things here: a) I AM a fan of anime - it's always been a fact (I was always watching Speed ​​Racer in preschool). b) I like different B-Movies because they are fun. c) I really like Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Going forward, when the movie arrives, it looks like it will be your usual B movie, down to bad FX, but all of a sudden, BOOM! the anime turns on! This is when the movie goes into the downhill WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is VERY bad and cheap, even worse than the one I remember from SPEED RACER, for the crissini! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes in the movie that "vividly" I remember is when a bunch of kids have finished school ... and they're still the same kids over and over again! FXs are terrible too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. Furthermore, the transition to live animation is not organized, the dialogues and voices (especially the English dubbing I saw) were horrible and I was asking my father to remove the tape from the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that made me survive was bursting jokes and comments like robots and Joel / Mike on MST3K (choose the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie and survive at the same time. <br /> <br /> Damn, I'm planning to show it to another friend of Otaku's my friend from Halloween for a B-film night. Because it's stupid, rather painful to watch and unintentionally funny at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement over the 0.5 / 10 that I originally intended to give it. <br /> <br /> (According to my rating scale: 3/10 means quite boring and bad, fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become fun how to count up to 15).
