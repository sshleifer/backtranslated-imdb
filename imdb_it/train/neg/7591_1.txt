This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Could anyone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this beautiful book should be adapted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how could you create a connection with Ask The Dust (the novel)? -And if you wanted to turn this story into a movie, why would you want to turn it into a romantic Hollywood melodramatic production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is badly done, and if you read the book and liked it, I'm pretty sure you won't like what Towne did. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, perhaps you will find the strange casting, the bad acting and the somewhat exaggerated cinematography. But you hope for the best. I was hoping for a lot during this movie. Actually I wanted it to be good. But it's just worse, and it's so simple: if you read Fantes's novel or not, this is not a good movie. Just another romantic Hollywood melodramatic production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - lots of pictures of Colin Farells' naked ass. <br /> <br /> I could complain much more about this movie, but why waste my time. I saw it. Alright. I had to see it, because I like the book so much and I was curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's sweet mustache at the end of the film. So sweet ... If he had worn it all the time, I'd given it 2/10.
