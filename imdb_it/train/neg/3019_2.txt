how can you take his story of a bounty hunter that is hard to live, fascinating and violently serious with * that accent? Is absurd. Apart from that, the visual style of the director is nauseating and deceptive, the plot is a shallow, boring, confusing gangster movie and the acting doesn't convince. The film introduces new characters throughout the film and is told in a fragmented flashback, mostly out of sequence, apparently just to make you feel kind and confused. The film always shows you THINGS THAT WOULD NOT REALLY HAPPENED and then later says "that it didn't really happen, it happened" - see the (apparent) killing of the (first) "first women". What have we seen for the first, wrong sequence of events? <br /> <br /> Terrible choice in casting, a complicated and confusing plot and a directorial style that leads to headache. 1/5.
