This film really started out great. He had the potential to turn into a truly heartbreaking and romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. There was really no need for anything else, and for a moment I got excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake, another timeless classic, perhaps a modern myth. Why, oh why, then ruin it in half by making the main character (Norton) another psychopath? Maybe I miss the point, but do we really need another psychopathic movie? Or is it this need in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the film industry? For a moment, I was about to take a mental note of the director's name; now I feel left indifferent. At least it should be added in the defense of the film that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. Besides, Evan Rachel Wood is really adorable to watch and a good actress with a lot of potential.
