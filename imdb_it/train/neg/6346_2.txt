This movie stinks! You will need two more hours to overcome it. Sliding Doors, with Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda and Melinda try to do VERY much better. That film was intelligent, witty and well acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather the characters he played - and the support cast's performances were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are boring, dialogue is forced and I could have cared less about these people - least of all Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at 10 am - and so melodramatic it is ridiculous, and not in the comic sense. The second Melinda is fine, but it should be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because, I guess, he spent time in the script and the actors were talented. A piece of curiosity about this film is that he wrote this script in two months: you can say it. And while Chloe Sevigny has talent - those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. The film ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a group of other people you know you've seen in other movies, but I can't remember which ones. Sad, very sad. <br /> <br /> Sad
