Raising Victor Vargas fails terribly in what he tries to be more: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality for this film. The characters and situations feel completely artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> The reason? Bad direction Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read somewhere that not lighting his film would give him an authentic touch. Mistaken! It just gives a poorly made touch. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give your film a documentary style, but gives the audience a headache and reduces what is on the screen instead of improving it. <br /> <br /> Of course, what is on the screen is so painfully false, as if Mr. Sollett had written his script with the sole aim of trying to look "trendy" with his Sundance friends and show how sharp a filmmaker is. <br /> <br /> In general, the only lasting impression this film leaves you with what is a bad director, Mr. Sollett. Next time, how about taking some writing and directing lessons?
