I looked on Hulu (too many commercials!) So it broke the pace, but still, it was like watching a really bad friend movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in which both sides are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I will protest the portrait of all males as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated on Western sales music videos and used a lot of western models so that males could touch them. I usually like Indian films, but this was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film. The story does not take place in India (the uncle continues to refer to when Mac returns to India) but I cannot find out where it is supposed to be happening.
