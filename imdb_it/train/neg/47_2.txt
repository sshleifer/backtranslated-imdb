When a man who doesn't have Alzheimer's disease can't remember how many movies he made, he's probably the most prolific director in the world after all. That man is Jesus Franco, the king of the so-called "eurotrash". His 1980 film, Devil Hunter, is the fastest, dull, stupid, lazy, and exploitative in the truest sense of the word (the film's title is misleading to begin with) like any other Franco film I've ever seen. This makes it rather horrible, and it is ... Yet Franco has a sort of inimitable sensitivity, a generous way with outrageous boldness, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid economic assembly that seeks to smooth out the extreme haste with which all his films were made. The mix of all these elements brings out your films, even while you're waiting for them to end because they're so boring. <br /> <br /> Devil Hunter is almost incomprehensible for the first half hour. The abduction by strangers of a white woman who appears to be a model or a movie star is interspersed with a group of native actions in South America. There's a lot of writhing nudes, dances and endless repeated zoom-ins on an ugly totem. It is necessary to get used to repetitive zoom-ins and to the technique of cutting the same shot about three times in a row immediately, as these are Franco's main methods for extending a film so as to make it available. <br /> <br /> The monster that looks like the totem is actually a little scary. His eyes are raw and his presence is always signaled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groans, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. At first she chews a native lady tied to a tree, and it's hard to know what really happens here, but I think she ate her stomach (or her genitals, sweet Jesus!). <br /> <br /> In any case, the adventure begins correctly when an experienced boy and his Vietnam veteran friend went out on the island to retrieve the white girl from the kidnappers. The flakey type has an accent which, as nicknamed, is half of Brooklyn American, half English of Liverpudlian and all retarded. All dialogue and dubbing are ridiculous and ridiculous, creating another level of the film that can somehow arouse your interest. <br /> <br /> It doesn't happen too much from here on, and it happens rather slowly, studded with a bit of indignation as a rape. The nebulous action is fleshed out (haha!) From acres of nudity to 360 degrees from the natives and the two female protagonists, and even from the monster itself. Going around with his penis uncovered makes it an unappetizing prospect for the sturdy hero, but at some point it has to be done, and it's nice to note that the director will show someone's genitals to the camera. <br /> <br /> The best feature of Devil Hunter is the location of the footage. Franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and narrative aspects of film production, but he is not around with sets. Get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. This is something that is really nice to experience in these days of shoddy CGI sets and wallpapers. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the recommendation issues on this film seem questionable. If you are looking to see all the Video Nasties, you will have to see it at some point, and you will be made restless as I was. If you like Franco, you will look at him anyway. If you don't fit into any of the categories listed above, chances are you'll never find this movie. Copies of it are not just around, and I could barely recommend searching for it. It's Franco. Franco lazy and crazy.
