This Worldwide was the cheap men's version of what the NWA had under Jim Crockett Junior and Jim Crockett Promotions made in the 1980s on the "Big 3" stations located during the Saturday Morning / Afternoon Wrestling Mania. When Ted Turner got his hands on Crockett's failed version of NWA, he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and proceeded to eliminate all NWA references. NWA World Wide and NWA Pro Wrestling were renamed with the WCW logo and transferred from Disney / MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida, and eventually became nothing more than WCN Nitro, Thunder and Saturday Night's summary shows. The last WCW program under the leadership of Turner was officially launched around the world to broadcast the WCW buy-out weekend by Vince McMahon and the WWF. Today the entire archive of NWA World Wide / WCW video tapes worldwide, along with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library, is located in the basement of the WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
