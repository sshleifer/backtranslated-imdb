About the child: why wasn't he the big brother, assuming he was hungry for a bottle or some nourishment or a diaper change? He should have screamed non-stop after so many hours without worrying. Definitely stupid to take the child from a safe place when he didn't need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road miraculously clear every time someone wanted to drive somewhere? Are there no uprooted trees that fall on the streets and block them? <br /> <br /> I can't imagine the police at the checkpoint not following immediately after a young man who crashed, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That said, it was nice to have a movie that children could look at safely, for a change.
