So, I got this job as an assignment for Trent Harris, who occasionally teaches in the U movie. I imagine this is his only real way to convince anyone to watch his movie ... <br /> <br / > The documentary section initially dragged. Yes, the kid is a fool nowhere, but he is not handsome enough to make it interesting. <br /> <br /> Seeing Sean Penn dressed as ONJ is the only attraction ... and after about thirty seconds he loses all his humor. <br /> <br /> When Crispin Glover confronts Larry, the story is better, but I couldn't stand it anymore ...
