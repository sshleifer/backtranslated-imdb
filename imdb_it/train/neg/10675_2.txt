You must understand that when the name of the star is listed incorrectly in the opening titles, you are not in for a good time (the credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). A nice car chase, shoot it, explode action if you ALL want the action, because the relationship with the plot exists at best, and it's absolutely incredible. The motivations of the characters, in particular that of Gooding in the end, are worse then incredible, they are irrational when they are not irretrievably confused. All I can think of is that Andy Cheng must really be a good guy to get so many good actors into this crazy project (he can't have anything on all of them, right?).
