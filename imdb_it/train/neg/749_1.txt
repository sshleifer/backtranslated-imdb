Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come with a budget of about 2 million dollars. Some have extended effects, others have recognizable casts and others still have both - for $ 2 million. <br /> <br /> Initially Hines claimed that this film had a budget of $ 20 million dollars, but it is painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $ 750,000 if not much less than that. Few sets are used, a number of scenes are shot on the green screen and most of the effects seem incomplete and amateurish. <br /> <br /> It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is misdirected, poorly executed and misguided, but because many of us have followed the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film, despite its relatively modest budget. <br /> <br /> Those of us who believed in this film when it was initially announced joined the legions of those mentioned by PT Barnum.
