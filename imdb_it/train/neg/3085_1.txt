Description: Corny, absolutely stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame, it'll make you wonder why these abnormally stupid people have even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I guess this ...) probably no more than $ 700 to make this movie. It was simply hysterical to watch with or without the Mystery Science Theater. I'm giving you the best advice in the world: <br /> <br /> Save yourself, save time, life and money, NOT - I repeat, I don't even wonder if you should see this movie. This film is so trivial that it will drive your face out of outraged boredom. If you have a single digit IQ, then be my guest and watch this absolutely contemptible movie. You could really admire it. (As I said before, IF you have a single digit IQ) <br /> <br /> With about 12 actors, some puppets you bought in a garage sale, and of course cameras and music, are at your fingertips you'll do a slightly more fun home video than this piece of absolute shit.
