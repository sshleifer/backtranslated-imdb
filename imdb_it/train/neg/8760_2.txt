This film is about non-institutional types (aesthetically and sexually) that apparently cannot withstand basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant and Cynthia Nixon, they are rooted in childish writing that relies almost entirely on intelligent dialogue; that it is not. The role of Nixon has the best lines, but often he runs into them too quickly, a lack of timing that must be left to the director. The grotesque climax uses all available clich√©s, spent or not, and appropriately concludes this tedious comedy attempt.
