Andie McDowell is as beautiful as the forty year old woman, whose late start in a serious relationship leads her to a considerably younger man and a falling quarrel with 2 best girlfriends ever. <br /> <br /> Seeing a gigolo / gold prospector in the sincere young man, the "friends", silenced to close this "silly relationship", go beyond the call of duty to "help" their friend ( that obviously a complicated game is blinded by this gigolo ". <br /> <br /> A brief succession of situations is absolutely ridiculous, but it is no longer possible to see it from afar. Without these incredible scenes, there could have been a hope for a sweet love story .. left with is an involuntary shaking of the head - these things just don't happen! Without giving away details on the hanger, I warn the viewer to have high expectations for this movie, most (like me) will be very disappointed. scale from 1 to 10, this ranks a weak 4 with me.There is much better material out there not worth your time
