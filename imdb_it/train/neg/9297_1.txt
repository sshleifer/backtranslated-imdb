I gave this to 1. There are so many twists that you can never be sure of getting. Total chaos. Everyone gets killed or almost. I'm tired of aiming and changing perspective. I can't give away the plot. Convoluted and crazy. If I had paid to see it, I would have asked for my money back. I wish the reviews were more honest.
