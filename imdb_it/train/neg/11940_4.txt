Well, I'd be lying if I said this could easily compete with Spiderman or the Batman movies. Still, it was more interesting to me because of its moral value. I bought the VHS for the first time when my son was about 2 years old and immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have since used credit cards to finance his first film, "Hollywood Shuffle". True, he needs to harness the talents and knowledge of technical consultants to make films more credible, but his films are still fun. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man offers a hero with an Urban Contemporary touch. I always thought that if there were superheroes, they wouldn't provide the same scenarios shown in the comics. Meteor Man is a realistic hero with real problems: broken cars, bad neighbors, local drug dealing gangs that use children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission has remained practically within the community. <br /> <br /> What I found to be really fun, outside of the "young forever" performance of James Earl Jones, was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a complete program for him, without his contribution, of course. It was fun to hear them offer to lend it to other communities where their extended families lived. Yes, the plot was weak, the film was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks first with my children. Robert Townsend works to bring films "home" so to speak. I doubt he will ever really be recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there are and always will be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> A point to reflect on the film, which I find amusing: during the whole battle with Simon, nobody took the trouble to call the police ???? Also, that mother and father know you will see their child fight from a window? My mother would have been right there, scrapping by my side, on tiptoe. Dad would load his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and take a look. Worth seeing at least once and good for those of you who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with the Robert cameos!
