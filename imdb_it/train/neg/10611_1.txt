Terrible acting of Potter and a flat plot without tension than ever. And as for the feminist controversy, it's ridiculous. I saw this garbage when it was released for the first time and although I found it boring beyond imagination I am happy to have seen it. This is because I now have an immediate answer to the question "what is the worst movie you have ever seen?" Also, I have the comfort of knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life will be better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed by the way Potter wrote a screenplay that captured the maximum number of art council grants from around the world (as revealed in the credits). <br /> <br /> I've only very recently seen Orlando and I can see how Potter learned the wrong lessons from making that movie. All that was needed was a bunch of flying costumes, some hard look at the main character's camera and a loose storyline to seduce the cinema in public. So why shouldn't he think he could get away with the self-indulgent nothing that is The Tango Lesson?
