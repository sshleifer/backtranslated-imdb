this film only gets a second star because I work in the center and I like to see it destroyed. the effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrible makes it a huge waste of money. I rented it so I don't complain too much about what I paid, but it's been a couple of hours that I'll never come back. the holes in the plot abound. terrible acting across the board. I don't recommend wasting time watching this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to see it, run away. I can't stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> where the hell did the second dragon come from? why didn't he show up before? how did they launch rocket launchers on dinosaurs only 500 years ago?
