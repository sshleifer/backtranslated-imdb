How many more of those fake "slice of life" movies have to be made? I hope they aren't too many. <br /> <br /> The raising of Victor Vargas is a very conscious attempt by director Peter Solett to attract the attention of Hollywood. Nothing bad in general. What is wrong with this film, in particular, is that it ignores the public and accumulates every clich√© in Hollywood's seemingly "sharp" independent production book. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be "real", so let the "documentary style" camera shake, except that no documentary would shake the camera on purpose ... <br /> <br /> It's "sharp" then let's not waste time lighting up the movie. <br /> <br /> It's "hip", so let's have kids use bad words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on, and so on. All you have left is a very conscious attempt to impress Hollywood that will not impress anyone outside the "rarefied" indie crowd that still seems to hail every bad movie.
