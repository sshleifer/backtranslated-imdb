With these people they pretend so many shots, using old movies and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were shot on a set created with actors, what is there to believe? The old country film is beautiful, but animal abuse and native degradation is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is OK in these old movies, but there's more to make this couple lose credibility. Returned as flyers, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-Vaudevillian, he used friends like Jack London to make a financial gain while rejecting them of copyright, denying his wife's apparent depression like a nice prop, all this makes these films unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them. He was OK as a director and photographer, but that's all.
