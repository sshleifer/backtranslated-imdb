I know slashers should always be bad, but come on, what the hell is it? It's as if a group of 10-year-olds had saved money for lunch and started filming by the end of the week. <br /> <br /> However, six young people all go to the same house to be killed off the screen. We have the brainy, the bitch, the other bitch, the black guy, the killer, the stereotypes of the genre. After one is eaten by a shaking the boat, the others are chased by a guy wearing a mask that the poor box people refused. There's a pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle, but then it gets back to having even more boredom, and especially more false lies. Seriously, we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves its sweet moment for everything. <br /> <br /> After each character you expected to die dies, the ugly standard blonde and her future boyfriend will be captured by the killer (they become, pushed and passed out) and the killer reveals himself. I think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the character list. The reason is just lousy and it doesn't even let me start the damn secret. The killer, of course, takes over too much time to explain everything (and then about ten more minutes in which he sinks his own arm for some reason) and eventually gets overwhelmed by a guy with a gun. Hey, it's not fair! <br /> <br /> Truly one of the most terrible films I've ever seen. I could have more fun watching a Lindsay Lohan movie, I swear. Certainly, most of the 1980s also sucked up slashers, but at least they threw a little T & A. This movie has nothing to do
