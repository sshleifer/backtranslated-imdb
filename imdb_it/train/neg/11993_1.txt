After seeing only half of the film at school in November, today, I saw that it was on the Flix channel and I decided to watch it to see the rest and write a new review on it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the film is based, Hatchet, is OK. This is a terrible adaptation of this. <br /> <br /> Terrible (and I mean terrible) acting, bad dialogue and media cinematography make up this terrible adaptation of Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The film begins Brian who is the cliché image of a teenager from the 80s (who wears a mullet, who beats the head of 80s cheap rock music) and his mother who driving in the car to get on a plane to fly to see his estranged dad (his parents are divorced ... now the dramatic break comes up.) Now Brian has greeted mom and dog and is flying to see his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (he was not like that in the book) who after a 2-minute flight has a heart attack and dies. In the book, he goes into more detail with the pilot who has more pain and seemed to be in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. <br /> <br /> The plane (within another two minutes) failed on the fuel (leaving us, the spectators, to suppose that it was there for hours even if the sun did not change position and the scenario seems EXACTLY the same.) Now he fell to the ground. <br /> <br /> This is the point in the film where everything is very different than the book. In the book it is said that his jacket was torn to shreds but in the film it is perfectly in place without tears or tears (it seems that he just bought it), he never said to climb a mountain, to see a wolf and fall asleep up there on the mountain, he never said he was attacked by a bear (he said a moose but not a bear), he never said he eats the numerous bugs he does, he never mentions the second tornado or he learned to get those sparrows, glue and eat them or that little fish trap that makes (which is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), nor does it mention the fact that it wounds his ribs from one of the tornadoes. <br /> <br /> He even thinks he can call what was depicted in the film as a tornado. All that was was just a storm that knocked down many of his things. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of this camp festival was Brian's lame flashbacks (which are never mentioned in the book) especially Brian's cliché scene waking up, walking to the window and seeing the his dad (with all his packaged things that can only fit perfectly behind his truck) starting and shouting "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (but obviously his father didn't hear him even though he was right outside) and he punched his fist through the window (wtf?) <br /> <br /> The ending is the only thing that's close to that In the book I think a of the fundamental things that the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was "you're the guy they were looking for! They stopped months ago ... they still left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without advice or therapy) that is returning to normal with his family. I think we should assume that they were together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey on the counter.) Then he shows his temporary home (for what, in the film, it seemed like three days, but in the book it was for several months) and his accept, again on a tree where he left it (even in the book it did not happen) showing where he engraved a message, so perfectly done: "HOME" (where did we really have to believe that he sculpted it perfectly with just that hatchet?) < br /> <br /> No quote can better summarize this film when Ghost World's Enid said "this is so bad that it went well again and again bad." Perfect description of this film. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to someone (who has not read the book) and is only watching a movie, nor would I do it to someone who has read the book (because they will be disappointed and bored to death. <br / > <br /> For those who have read the book, let your imagination create the film - this is terrible and will make your thoughts fall on the book. <br /> <br /> 1/10
