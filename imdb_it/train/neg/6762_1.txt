This is the kind of film in which everyone involved should be embarrassed. Poor direction, top acting and a plot that has no other purpose than to show violence. When I first saw it I thought it might be a media satire and how violence shows, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone does his worst direction ever. From the scenes where Woody Harrelson's face turns for no reason or the horrible performance of Robert Downey Jr as Wayne Gale, who is a reporter who seems totally unlucky, this movie is simply a mess.
