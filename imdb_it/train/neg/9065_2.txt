Towards the middle, I realized that I didn't care at all about these characters; however, I looked a little more anyway. Unfortunately, I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered him. <br /> <br /> If you know * anything * about the movie in advance, you know the protagonist will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what's going to happen next - it will enter the phone and call the people! It was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another ugly catastrophic aviation film). I realize that this is an old movie, and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even for those standards, acting was awkward. These were not characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect that this film was, more than anything else, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband (Gary Merrill) career. But to no avail, I saw the oaks show more genuine emotions than his own. <br /> <br /> Davis played the happy cripple (ie a non-glamorous role) that was probably considered bold and daring career move. It wasn't. It was just boring. He was kind of Tiny Tim in the film, making Trask (the character of Merrill) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although he was less attractive than Tiny Tim), calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a clue that her beloved husband had just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene, in which Trask called his wife to Iowa to be reconciled, was so struck and shaken excessively at both ends of the telephone line, I almost collapsed. I had to remind myself that these people were paid for what they were doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it edifying, it's great. But frankly, I just found it bad. There are many old Hollywood Golden Age movies that have been written and performed much better.
