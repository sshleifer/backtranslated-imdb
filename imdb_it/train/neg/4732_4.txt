If I write a review on a film, maybe it will stay with me ... but generally I expect that I will forget to have seen it only in two weeks. So why worry? Because again I find myself watching a low-level movie that was fun to watch. I didn't expect to be able to stay in the room while it was on. <br /> <br /> It wasn't nice, but at least it wasn't unbearable ... not a comedy of errors that always makes me shudder. It was just sweet fluff ... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who defend this film because it will surely satisfy its targeted demographic, and it will not be a total boredom for an adult. <br /> <br /> It offers some good laughs here and there, but a side splitter. Sure it's silly and just sweetly funny, but at least it doesn't suck (as many have said it does). Perhaps they are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /> <br /> I have a tendency to evaluate on the bell curve, so a 4.5 or 6 is actually an all-around ok score in my book. Giving him a 4 makes sense and will strengthen his assessment at the time of writing this article. Giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done so far, makes the evaluation numbers meaningless. I can't believe how strongly people feel in one way or another about this forgettable softness (or that I'm also taking the trouble to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> In any case, it should be noted that Emma Roberts plays her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often written in the roles of b * ch does not disappoint when his character gets the due. You can also recognize Bruce Spence by playing Leonard, even though his role is ancillary. <br /> <br /> Surely you can lose this if you are an adult. But if there's a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her ... and be prepared to NOT hate it (you might even enjoy it).
