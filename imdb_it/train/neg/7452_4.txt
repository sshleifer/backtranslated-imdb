For me, this movie just seemed to fall into my face. The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I don't know if this grows by type or simply by his behavior, but I doubt that Glover can ever play a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. Apart from that, the film is your version of the serial killer story. Nothing very innovative.
