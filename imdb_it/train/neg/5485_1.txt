Without reiterating what was said above regarding this film, I would like to add that I could not wait to watch this film ... the cast / location and work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc ... He had a vague shadow of 'Don't look now on the plot from the beginning. A stay in a different environment (back in Italy) to blur the broken heart of the loss ... or maybe that's how I saw it? So, consequently, I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and turn around what we expect to happen to this family in a European foreign country ... and I sat there and sat there .. .. and guess what? in reality nothing happens! and I don't mean anything !! You are not even given the chance to enter the characters because they are so three-dimensional and empty. You are led to believe by the rhythm of the film that something would have happened to turn the whole film in your head ... The older daughters who flirt with local wasps, had great chances to take the film in another direction, the visions of the younger daughters of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and useless exercise, the fathers tried to be seduced by one of her students felt ridiculous given her age. It seemed as if the script had a final reminder that they had decided at the last minute to eradicate the guts of the story and had simply reduced it to the bare minimum. When the credits start rolling (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel robbed of your time sitting around watching this pile of garbage.
