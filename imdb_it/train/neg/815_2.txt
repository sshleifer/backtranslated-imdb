I just received the special edition for 4 British Superman 1 records for about $ 5. The additional material includes the 1951 movie Superman and Mole-Men. So I slapped him in the DVD player last night, and here are my findings. <br /> <br /> A bit of initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I mentally labeled it as one of Kirk Alyn's serials. I'm not a big fan of George Reeves like Superman, and I hadn't seen anything but the weird clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> This production in black and white for less than an hour. It has the feeling of a couple of episodes of one of the first TV series of Reeves, a two-parter, put together for the cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any case, it's a strange choice for reasons I will refer to later. I have an age where I remember television and film productions limited to one or two places and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this is REALLY low budget. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which, perplexed, also hosts the deepest oil well in the world (6 miles). The story opens with the foreman of the well who hastens to take steps to close the well. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters from Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. While Clark is sniffing the fact that the drill emerged in a radioactive cave 6 miles deep, a couple of strange little boys (small in stature, large in head, black in overalls and thick eyebrows) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and begins to go around the city with puzzled expressions on their faces. <br /> <br /> A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the photo. The kids scare some children, so Jeff Corey (who plays the rampant xenophobic in the city) incites some friends to kill these "creatures". Superman intervenes (moderately ineffectively) and takes one of the boys who was shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's companions burn the hut that the other child hid and assume he was killed, but he escapes and drops him down the shaft. Corey incites a lynching (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the Mole-Man in the hospital. Superman prevents them from entering the hospital and brings the injured chappie to the well to bring him back to his companions. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some kind that shoot Jeff Corey (I call this Aargh! Gun because his only effect seems to be to let Corey "Aargh!" Go) and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of Superman's astonishment that saved him after the way he behaved, the Mole-men go back to the well. The end. <br /> <br /> Although the film only lasted an hour, there is an excessive amount of crawling, attention and pursuit - I left out all the "Mole-Man 1 creeps in from A to B, looking out to make sure no one is following him "stuff". The Mole-Men are never involved in any way - they don't have dialogues - they show up, they are persecuted and come back. They look a bit creepy, but I'm not the monsters from the infected eyes that the reaction of the city implies. <br /> <br /> Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more than Lois Lane rather indifferent to Phyllis Coates, but it's a terrible and terrible Superman: Not only does it look like the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is a rather light-haired improvement he showed off in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book .I'm sure he was told to "hit the pose" (c he Superman constantly), but someone should have told him that he should be punching his hips, not his fists on his ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather severe and touching teacher - in fact he doesn't shake his finger as a sign of remonstrance, but he could have done it too. <br /> <br /> And Superman takes a lot of steps around (I say a huge amount - it's not really in it much more), and a little bit of a run. It takes off and lands a couple of times, but you can't see it anywhere. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision like Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, the visual effects are evident due to their absence, and the few that are present are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to consider this effort by referring to the standards of the time: but even according to those standards I think it's a rather worn-out effort. Fortunately, the TV series production standards were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories that had a little more than them. <br /> <br /> Something of a disappointment - I won't be looking again.
