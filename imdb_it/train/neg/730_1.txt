I haven't seen the first movie and if something like that doesn't have a great desire to do it. <br /> <br /> Having just seen it a few hours ago, I find it hard to remember one thing about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, the main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people who are in a house with that old lousy Friday 13 and are chased by a wooden board. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the film ends, I'm filing a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie because I want compensation for the time missing in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this film out of my hands ...... oh wait for it to be given to a "friend" already.
