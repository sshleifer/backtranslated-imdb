High heels are complicated things. They can elevate women (or men in disguise) to new heights, propose a precise style statement and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a dangerous foot pain that will inevitably lead to travel, falls and a final tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointing journey than an elegant high laugh. <br /> <br /> Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is certainly elegant, but in terms of plot it is a bound and boring story full of confusing, complex characters that are never fully involved or make sense. Apart from a few comedy moments, the Tacones leones are not interesting. The best part comes early in a wonderfully macabre case of culpable murder orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant piece of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel. <br /> <br /> There are quite solid acting performances and there is a certain, elegant art direction that you would expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise the Tacones lejanos is not an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, spectacle, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer, this could have been a melodramatic power. Instead he is poor. High Heels stumble for sure.
