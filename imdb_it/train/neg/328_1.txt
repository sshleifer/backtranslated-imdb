I'm a big Adam Sandler fan, and one day I was watching the Cast & Crew selection on one of his DVDs and saw "Going Overboard" and decided to go out and rent it. So I went out with some friends and rented it. We wore it and we were shocked to see an Adam Sandler who hasn't yet hit puberty, looks like he's 12 when this movie came out. I couldn't even look at the 30 minutes of this shit, I wasn't laughing, giggling or still smiling at this movie, actually the only time I smiled was when I saw how awful this movie was. I couldn't believe how much he tried to make the viewers laugh in this movie ... and it didn't work once. Although seeing the horrible camera angles and listening to the disgusting script I realized why I had never heard of this movie, ... because it sucks more than anything I've ever sucked before. This film, in my opinion, was the worst movie ever made, .... NEVER!
