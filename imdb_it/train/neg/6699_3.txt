"Algie, the Miner" is a silent and bad comedy. The slapstick time is completely turned off. This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if they should be funny or not. However, the actual quality of the film is irrelevant. This is a mandatory view for movie fans, especially since it is one of the first examples of gay cinema. The main character of Algie is an effeminate boy, who plays very similar to the stereotypical "pansy" common in many ancient films. The film has the common homophobic attitude of the time. "Algie, the Miner" is rather horrible, but fascinating from a historical point of view. (3/10)
