Kurosawa has really upset him about this. Every genius is allowed a failure. The concept is good but the execution is very blurry. <br /> <br /> There is an atmosphere of fantasy in this film that makes it something of an art film. The poverty of Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic representation. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing film.
