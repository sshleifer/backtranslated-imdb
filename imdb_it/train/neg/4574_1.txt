I went to this movie expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi. Boy, I was wrong. Yes, there is a poorly written and misinterpreted plot in the film (with animated CG cells and peptides to be started). However, the real focal point of the film is the "expert" talking heads that spew new age feeling good between the various segments of the plot. Sure, he's innocent enough. There's a bit of real quantum physics at the beginning. For example, he states that electrons exist both as a particle and as a wave and that an atom is mostly empty space. However, the film takes a gigantic (and unscientific) leap, saying that subatomic quantum effects also occur on large scales. The talking heads do it even more. According to them, the following is true: <br /> <br /> - When Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the natives were unable to see his ships because their minds were unable to perceive something so different. - Meditation can reduce the murder rate. - With positive thinking, you can walk on water. -Your thoughts can change the formation of ice crystals in water bottles. <br /> <br /> And hey, it's only in the first 40 minutes! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was torture. This film looked like a movie that would show you to get yourself into a cult. After doing my homework, I realized that it's basically just that. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this could be seen as a campy comedy (although it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Save time and money: don't see this movie.
