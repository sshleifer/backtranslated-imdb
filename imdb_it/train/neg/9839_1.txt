The beginning of this film was good. He started to get really stupid after telling people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a small town like that I would be offended after seeing this movie. They made many of these people look stupid and crazy. How could these people have so little to do that they follow him all day. Many times these people told him ways to kill himself as if they were pushing him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for others? I also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie. There were also good parts to this film. Some people might like it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
