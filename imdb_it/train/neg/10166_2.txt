If he wanted to be precise, he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a group of NY actors who knew nothing about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I've lived in SF all my life, and people here don't talk or act like these actors did. Everything was too dramatized, and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper. No wonder he was the only one in the film who really dressed like the cats out there (ie his Warriors shirt). Not once did I notice that someone was wearing a Giants or 9ers suit; instead he mounted them in some science fiction or Hollywood hand-made shirts that are not even sold here. HP has no bowling alleys, black and Asian gangsters DO NOT wear bracelets in the colors of Africa or the Chinese Olympic team, nor do every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming shirt and try to play black while shooting hoops. Furthermore, while there is now a significant yuppie community that invaded the Mission, all that was shown was a white guy and a self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua". This is NOT New York! The Puerto Ricans here are few and far between, and the Latinos in the mission are very, very different from what was shown here, which was undoubtedly from New York. Furthermore, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City. An accurate movie would have shown the drama between the HP sets in their own hood and those of Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, etc. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been a lot better if Lee had done something more at home and has a better plot to work with.
