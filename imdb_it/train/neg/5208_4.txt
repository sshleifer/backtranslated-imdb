This mini series, also based on a book by Alex Haley as "Queen", tried to use similar formulas, that is to build a long history following the life of a family for many years. While in "Queen" the result was masterful, here in Mama Flora lacked inspiration. First perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in this television production. Too many things are introduced too hastily over the years, so that the saga that is unfolding is superficial, superficial, not as authentic as in "Queen". Full marks for the script in the previous parts of the film, which was prepared with great care, but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a sort of unpleasant mix from the Asian-forsythian in the last third of its three hours. I was hoping for more; but evidently Haley was less inspired by this story than by his almost biographical "Queen", and Peter Werner III is not as good as John Erman. Recommended only for those who have an appetite for these long stories of growing generations.
