Well, since I saw the part from 1 to 3, I can honestly say that they would NEVER be part of 4. Everything from bad taste, and I mean bad taste for acting really bad, I challenge anyone to look at it and not be bored by they mean that the parts from 1 to 3 have kept the strong vibration on the Damion plot, but without him in this case it is not the same thing. Of course, at the end of the third part, I was getting a little tired of the continuous plot, but at the end of the third it was a good closure. Once again there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there had been they could have done a MUCH better job than this I had to sit down, lol. There will be an hour and a half of my life that I will never see again.
