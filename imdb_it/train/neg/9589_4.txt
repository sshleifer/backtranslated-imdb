This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. It is a perfect film if you look at the colorful images dancing across the screen, each without an apparent connection to the next one. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of David Bowie and I really appreciate musicals. Ultimately, Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the song and dance sequences were scarce and left much to be desired. The moral of the story was really confusing. I couldn't understand if it was about racial problems in London in the 1950s or not selling. For the first half of the movie I was giggling as much as it was messed up, but I liked the campiness of the "no sell out" message. When blacks started getting killed, I thought my tape got messed up. Did I rent half of two different films? No, there was a song "Keep Britain White" and a dance sequence. I'm sorry, but World War II is not something you can write a musical about. At least not a musical that could be described as "campy" as I have repeatedly in this review. In general, I would say that this film could do much better if it made a decision and launched better actors. (And put David Bowie in there for a damn curse!) My vote: C-
