I am a Christian. I have always been skeptical of films made by Christians, however. As a rule, they are "not knowing" when it comes to film production. I admire TBN for trying to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest way on the screen. However, they did a horrible job. The acting was horrible and, unless you are familiar with the Bible in a certain way, you could not understand what it was trying to get through the film. Not only was the film made terribly, but the people who did it also made a few facts wrong. However, in this "criticism", these facts are irrelevant and too profound to investigate. In short, the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for the comic relief from the daily routine.
