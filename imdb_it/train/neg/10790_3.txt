First of all, I'm not a big fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is due to the fact that the usual box-office box-office hit pattern hits the waist. This film is not an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing announcements imply. In my simple opinion, the only purpose of this film is to make money by touching a sensitive morale (in reality it is mostly considered taboo in the native country). Economic populism could provide a brief definition of what I meant. <br /> However, the acting is almost perfect. In fact, most of the cast has a theatrical background and has tried to compensate for what was missing in Altioklar; talent! All the cast members were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (Like Janset) At least, Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation, just because he knows how to choose the cast. In addition to this, he is just a media monkey, who assumes a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that consists only of dealing with naked / half-naked women. And precisely because the media boast, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Close your ears and something really artistic, I look forward to applauding your next job. I hope, this time you can reach an artistic approach. <br /> <br /> In short; Pros> Good acting, sexy women (I'm kidding!) :) Cons> Every single thing, apart from the cast
