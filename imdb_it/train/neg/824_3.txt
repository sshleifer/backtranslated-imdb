Gene Hackman gets caught out of jail by an unnamed government agency that wants him for a murder. Obviously it is a fact that Hackman has the competent skills for the job. <br /> <br /> Nobody tells them anything anyway, it is given to them while the public receives information and bits. It should be full of suspense, but it's boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman carries out the mission, but the escape is messed up and the guy on top of this mysterious entity orders everyone to kill him to cover him. So everyone in the cast is dead and in the end you don't really care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and hit quite a bit. Perhaps something has been lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was an act of mercy for the public. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast with people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach and Edward Albert is so completely wasted here is a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never find out which federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even the IRS.
