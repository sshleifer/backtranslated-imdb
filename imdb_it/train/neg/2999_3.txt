Another rip of FRIDAY OF THE 13th, even with some of his music! A group of young adults gather for a small high school meeting and begin to be massacred by Jason Voorhees. Could it be that nerd who tormented at school? <br /> <br /> The slash-fest routine is fun for fans of the genre, and contains the usual share of T & A for movies, if it's a similar genre. The finish is a little more imaginative than your standard slasher. <br /> <br /> MPAA: Assessed for violence / blood, language, sexuality, nudity and some drug content.
