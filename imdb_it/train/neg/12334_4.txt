The premise is ridiculous, the incredible characters, the banal dialogue and the absurd ending. <br /> <br /> Believe me, I'm a fan of Kevin Kline, but watching him make a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as an alleged French is not as fun as it seems. <br /> <For his part, Meg Ryan is once again perky and adorable as (take your pick): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, whatever you think is the cutest creature on earth. She too has not the slightest resemblance to a true human being. <br /> <br /> This film strikes me as an opportunity seized by friends Lawrence Kasdan and Kline for the holidays in Paris and the south of France despite being well paid for it. So I can't really blame them.
