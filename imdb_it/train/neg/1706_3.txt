Wow, this was a very bad movie ... as read in other comments this movie has no plot, no character development, maybe they have some sort of script but it's hard to say based on the actual end result. <br /> <br /> The editing of this film was really non-existent, it tends to jump from one scene to another without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in determining what is really happening. <br /> <br /> All in all it is simply a low budget zombie movie that has not been thought of at all, has a bad acting, a bad dialogue, all bad. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves this movie from 1 or 2 is the gore factor, I think this should be the place where they spent the money they had to try to justify this. <br /> <br /> Unless you're (like me) dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie movies you can find, don't look at this. Period.
