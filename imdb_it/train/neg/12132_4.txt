A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, steals late at night. They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who are just looking for a terrorist. Obviously the police confuse the gang of thieves for the terrorist, the real terrorist runs away, and thieves are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar, taking hostages, unaware of why the police are so intent on capturing them. And guess who else chose the bar as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it goes down the hill from there. Spacey has acquired quite a lot of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but they're all wasted. Especially because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the movie is argue. Endless and aimless. Long before the film ended, you stopped caring about what happened to them.
