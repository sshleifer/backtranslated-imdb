When I started watching this movie I saw the guy from Buffy, Xander, and I realized how nice it was that he was still making a living playing in movies. Now a strange film that I can bear, given that it is a good dose of strangeness, such as David Lynch's films, twin peaks, the lost highway, etc. And you have to be in the mood for one. But this made me mockingly remind the crazy conspiracy theory websites that make absolutely no sense. I mean, are you people of the Nazi who conspire with America to create a diabolical triad of evil powers? I was surprised not to mention the empty land in this film with flying saucers and Hitler's lizards. Maybe if I had 60 grams of heroin with this film it would have been a bit sensible, but seriously I won't condone drugs like I don't condone this movie. It should be burned, shattered and forgotten just so well that Xander could get another acting job. However it wasn't his acting, it was fine, but the script didn't make any sense. Sorry.
