All the shirtless women in the world could not stop me from pressing the stop button about a third of the way through this horrible garbage. With derisory acting, the script equally terrible plus the poor CGI FX to match; this film is an insult to the Werewolf genre. It should be serious, which in itself would be fun if this movie could even get to the level of being a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent, but too lazy to do something even a decent quarter. Avoid at all costs and instead watch one of Werewolf's classic films. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
