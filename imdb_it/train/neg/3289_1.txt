I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows on TV. Did we really need a new screen? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland, brought out all the music and made a drama. You think they want it! This film does not have the same feeling that the original had. Of course, the original was a little trivial at times, but Bo and Luke were always kind, got into trouble because they were always ready to get into trouble and their main goal was to help people passing through the city. None of this has infected the people who made this film, perhaps they have never seen the original show to the end. My big question is: what will they ruin next?
