This film has all the features of too many cooks who spoil the stew. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that the powers could not leave themselves well enough. They couldn't decide if this was Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and also how slow anyone's story could be at will. So a film that could have been a story of two fascinating personalities (Fitzgerald) and infamous (Mrs. Graham) becomes a disjointed tetra soap opera that tells us little about both. In addition to this, there is absolutely no period other than 1959. The clumsy scene follows clumsy scenes and we have no idea where we are in history or how long it takes. However - and this saved the film for me - Kerr has never been more beautiful, and Peck is always a very handsome man. They really make a nice couple, and I just wish they had better material to work with. There's a scene that works - Scott chases Shielah while he's drunk, and seeing these two normally refined stars collide is very disturbing and gives a fleeting idea of ​​what happens in a relationship like theirs. In addition to this, the film is a wasted opportunity and nowhere near the classical stature of other soaps from 1950 produced by Wald (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).
