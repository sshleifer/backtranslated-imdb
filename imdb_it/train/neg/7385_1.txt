The film is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is exhilarating. This film is a big mess. It almost seems that when action music intervenes, the most impressive stunt is running. Both voices are dubbed with Mr. McGregor or steven sang too much and changed his voice. There is too much dialogue in this film and an extremely negative acting on everyone's behalf. The film is a great sleep therapy. Combat is ridiculous. The effect of shifting the shape of the eyes on the evil women drugged by the designer drug addict was decent. The main villain was a joke and his character was underdeveloped. The main villain was used to explain the story through questioning, he would have simply thrown random plots into one (spoiler) "CTX (his design drug) will be in water reserves" that is never addressed in the conclusion or mentioned again in the movie. This film is highly recommended to pass.
