I was thrilled to discover this comedy from the late 1960s that sees some of my favorite characters: Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was then compounded to find that the film does not work like a comedy or a perfect robbery movie. Ustinov plays a little crook just out of prison who sets up his sites on a large American company based in London. Going unnoticed in front of CEO Karl Malden and geek technician Newhart, Ustinov pretends to be a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect robbery' part of the film. To do this he needs to get a tamper-proof security system that protects the company's mainframe. And here is the problem one. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the movie is incredibly confident and stupid. His inconvenient excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computing center in any place to avoid disturbing the cameras. The second problem is the robbery (the fraud in reality) occurs within the first 30 minutes of the film, depriving the rest of the image of very dramatically. Maggie Smith is sadly misplaced like Ustinov's neighbor / secretary next door who just can't keep a job. I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too much together here, too composed, the part required more than a moving physical comedian. Furthermore, Ustinov and Smith do not have a chemistry together, perhaps it is the age difference, but the subsequent romantic relationship, as devoid of a true romanticism, is still a bit disturbing. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was well thought out at the time, but I found it not funny, sinuous and a sad waste of an exceptional cast.
