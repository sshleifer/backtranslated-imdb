First of all, I loved the Ray Bradbury novel. It's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and attacks you later. It was one of his best books, with, you know, Fahrenheit 451 and Dandelion Wine. I just hope this movie is going well. He had many possibilities, with an exceptional cast, like Jason Robards and Jonathn Pryce. And Bradbury even wrote the script himself. Plus, it has PAM GRIER! <br /> <br /> How could it fail? <br /> <br /> There may be spoilers inside. <br /> <br /> First of all, it was made silent. Much of the horror of the book has been lost as Bradbury must have been forced to keep violence to a minimum. All the images in the book ... disappear. Everything that made you squirm ... gone. <br /> <br /> And then there's acting. Like many films that Disney threw out in the 1980s, the guys in this movie can't act. And that bothered me a lot, neither of them seemed 13 but 9 or 10. Their strong friendship was not addressed. It was more like they were acquaintances. <br /> <br /> You would think that Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce could do it in their role as Mr. Halloway and Mr. Dark. But here it is as if they did not care. All they want to do is somehow pay off a mortgage or something. This is far from being some of their best performances. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was as good as the witch, but the character of Dust Witch herself was not well drawn out. It is much less bad and does not have the presence as it did in the book. <br /> <br /> And all that was left out of the book. The night chase of the ballon, the marking of Jim's house, the real death of Mr. Dark, what happened to Mr. Coogan on the carousel, the fate of the lighting auction seller, the true death of the witch, and oh much more. <br /> <br /> And the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. The merry-go-round of misfortune for a thing with the overlapping horses that turned were not really disturbing, and that strange green haze that really had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> I could go on talking about how this film tore apart the original novel, but it makes the blood boil. Don't see this movie but read the book. It's a Bradbury classic.
