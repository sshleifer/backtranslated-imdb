Simply rubbish. I'm a big fan of Cusacks, that's the only reason I watched this movie, but the only reason I can see their presence was the recovery, in full depth and less quality, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from this, the role of the film as a political satire fails miserably because it is too obvious even for those who are the sweetest out there to serve any purpose. And making it pay as a satirical satire would simply be an insult to even chimpanzees. Imitation is, apparently, the highest form of flattery, but since it is nothing close to Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league that meets Spartans (see if it's an idiot) in terms of political satire, we leave it pretty well alone and let this vanish into the darkness that it absolutely deserves.
