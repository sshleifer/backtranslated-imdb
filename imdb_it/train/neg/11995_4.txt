I was so excited and excited to watch this movie when the promos first came out in November! It looked great and the songs! I was pretty disappointed when I went to see it! This is a film that intertwines 6 pairs. He has a cast of 12 people! A huge amount of stars worked on this film. I think the director, Nikhil Advani, didn't handle the situation well and shouldn't have had many people in this film, because that would have made it easier for him. Compared to Nikhil's directorial debut "Kal Ho Naa Ho", "Salaam-e-Ishq" is rather behind. I think Nikhil should have a cast of smaller stars. I think the best factors of this movie are the songs! The songs are excellent and I think all the songs are fantastic, Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did a great job and did an excellent job over the years. I think that the ratings of this movie can go up because of the excellent songs! One thing I was disappointed with was that the director should not have included the nudity in this film that was made by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar. I found this extremely rude looking at this with the family! Although some may find this naked as a comedy, it is not something you would like to see with your parents! I think the best acting was played by Salman and Priyanka Overall, I think it's a good movie!
