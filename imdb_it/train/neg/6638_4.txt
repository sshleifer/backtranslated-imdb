A note for all you budding film writers: study this film. If your dialog box is similar to the dialog box for this movie, please destroy the script and try again. <br /> <br /> I had no great expectations, but I was intrigued by the description indicating that there was a mystery in the Christmas factory ornament. The mystery was solved very soon and the film becomes a romance novel. I almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes, 10 minutes and the first break. My spouse, who is the Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up the first break. <br /> <br /> Forest River is a business city - the main activity is Aikens Ornaments, which creates all sorts of holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company has recently disappeared, so the future of the companies could be in question. Soon we will meet Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than on Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who gets a date with Noelle after a big snowman is working his way into Justin's car. Once we meet Alison Aikens, doing due diligence for the Board, we have our own story setting. <br /> <br /> If you can't find all the narrative arcs by the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this type of holiday film. Maybe it's a good thing.
