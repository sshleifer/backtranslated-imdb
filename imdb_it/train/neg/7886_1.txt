I have nothing against religious films. Religious people need something to watch on Saturday nights, I guess. But what really scares me is when the writing on the DVD box does not indicate this to the potential viewer. Distributing religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT nice, brother. And even if I were a religious person, I should agree with most of the other posters here, this film was a disaster. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly written, and attempting to create a soundtrack was hilarious. The false accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes and the continuity was out of the window. The only reason we came across this boring waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie. You should have just gone to bed. <br /> <br /> Absolutely no salvific qualities for this film, unless you are the religious type who will immediately approve anything that will preach your believers to disbelievers, even if it is a pile of junk. If you are not, avoid this at all costs. Don't be fooled by the box-up.
