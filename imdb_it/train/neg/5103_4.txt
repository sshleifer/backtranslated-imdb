I've heard it for a long time to start the "legitimate" movie, many guys behind the scenes work on porn movies. <br /> <br /> The people who produced and directed this monstrosity remained too long. /> <br /> Poorly rhythmic, staged and written, he uses very good talent (Diehl, Dorn, Eggert) badly. <br /> <br /> Many sexual activities are jokingly caused here by the crackling host of the alien creature, but it never crosses the line ... <br /> <br /> You'll still want to take a shower later.
