First of all I would like to apologize for my bad English. <br /> <br /> I'm not a HOSTEL-hardcore-fan, but I liked that movie anyway. Feed live, however, SUCKED GREAT TIME! I've never seen a goreo movie with superb acting, but hey, who's surprised? The acting in Live Feed was ... well, not there! I saw some commented on this as it must have been a school project or something. Okey, but not by students in the media or in acting school. This was NO class! And the story? A real rip-off at the hostel. And the gore? What about the psychopathic torture scenes that should turn your stomach and leave you sweating cold? This was the most disappointing of the hole movie! Short, fast and borderless. More like an execution than a torture. Okey, where there were buckets of blood, but it didn't even look real. Slaughter and violence reminded Braindead more than the hostel or any of Saw's films. And Braindead was fun! Okey, I laughed at Live Feed a couple of times, but it was more for disappointment than for fun! <br /> <br /> So instead of wasting 80 minutes looking at live feeds, look at NOTHING anymore!
