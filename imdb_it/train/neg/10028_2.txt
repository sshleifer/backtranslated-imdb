I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more since it was a Yashraj movie. <br /> <br /> Jimmy runs a call center and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach his boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to escape, but Pooja tells Jimmy he can't do it because he has a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and only then Jimmy discovers that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. Meanwhile, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja. <br /> <br /> Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the film is directed by debut director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yup! The scenario is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her highly publicized weight loss) looks good. But the plot is extremely thin in the story and sometimes it doesn't make sense from one scene to another - so why did I say at the beginning that I expected more from this film because it was a Yashraj production. With reference to the songs, unfortunately, there is no song that I can remember now. <br /> <br /> There are times when you can laugh and this is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could certainly have done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well. But this can't be said for Anil Kapoor - it didn't quite suit him at all. Finally, it doesn't matter to Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films like "Mohabbatein", what was Yash Chopra doing producing a trash film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: bad movie, it's not worth wasting time and this is my first and last impression.
