There are no spoilers in this review because everything has already been shown in the movie trailer. I'm trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local films, but I can't help supporting the game against this movie. It is slow, boring and to the point of being useless. Even the "beautiful and credible moments" were immediately challenged by painful clich√©s and bad acting. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, who I usually love, were passable only in this film. It seemed that the director was trying to create a TV Soap melodrama, then got himself caught and decided to put it on the big screen. The Leap Years should come with an RA rating (Rated Awful) but did not change my confidence in local films. Other good films will come, as long as no other films like these are made.
