This is without doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen. This makes your TV movie series look like Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by the one and only Britney Spears and her mother, this is a trash with nothing to do, a reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you were well paid) to save her. The story of a red gill that wins a scholarship at a prestigious music school is little but a vehicle to pedal the music of Mrs. Spears' pants to the consumer and generally agrees that low eyelashes must be the Street. There is nothing good here with all the predictable rhythms like night after day. Never again.
