I saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out. Boy, I was disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the acting (apart from Christopher Walken) is bad, and I don't care less about the characters, besides really wanting to see Nora's husband being beaten. The role of Christopher Walken is so unresolved, what a joke!
