This show is probably the biggest, ugliest and most generic steam pile I've seen in children's programming that has actually been successful. The main character, Johnny, while I understand he should represent a normal child, is neither nice nor tolerable. The jokes are lame, exaggerated (ie the gag "Whoa! I didn't see what's coming". Come on, it wasn't even funny the first time. It's not even cute) and lacks any form of wit or primitive inspiration. And finally ... it's just plain ugly to watch. While children are not particularly critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. I can't stand watching the show, because in a sense, the artistic style is just ... gross. Horrible, in fact. Simply poor. <br /> <br /> I can't stand that this is getting so much transmission time. While I understand that nostalgia can be a bit irrational and I shouldn't hope for it to come back ... I really miss old cartoons. Report Dexter's Laboratory, the Powerpuff Girls ... everything except this crap. I guess it's just wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> Simply put, I advise you not to waste your time on this show. I think even the older ones can have fun with really good cartoons. And this doesn't cut it.
