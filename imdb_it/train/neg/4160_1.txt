This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over none of us understood the plot. Apart from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the "special effects" weren't so special and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only saving factor of the film is that it's so incredibly bad that it's pretty funny. You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while the actors are vomiting a lousy dialogue. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh. Now it's a running joke between my friends and me. 1 in 10.
