It touches some interesting points .. But! - It fails to show proof of all the 'exclusive' studies shown. Who are the "friends" and "small groups of scientists" who have collected this data? - What's up with all of Al Gore's biography? How he liked to play with cows on the ranch or that his child was hit by a car .. too bad but ... what does this have to do with the ozone layer? <br /> <br /> I have seen MUCH better stuff, in much less time, on the Discovery Channel .. I really don't understand why this has such a high score on IMDb. Unless you have lived under a rock, this 'documentary' should not be new to you ... all this is old news ... And all that Al Gore is trying to do is get popularity points . Postscript I'm not American so I don't even try to say I'm a fan of the bush: p
