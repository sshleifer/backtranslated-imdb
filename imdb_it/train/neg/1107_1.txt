I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought, "wonderful! It will be fantastic!" I was so wrong. The story has all been ruined. In fact, I still don't understand. It seems to me that all the characters have been drinking, smoking (opium?) And having sex. Not that those are not good cinematic qualities, but please! Where was the story? I did finish the film, and yes, it went towards the end, but by then the film was almost finished. Rent it if you really want it. Just don't trust the back of the box.
