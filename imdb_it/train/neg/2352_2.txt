Crude, sometimes coarse - for me it is the sum of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. It has no point of view - only superficial and amusing excavations of stereotypes. What's the movie about?? It is a question of signaling a clan of people (the so-called types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you're in or out. Is that there is no press to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and that it is only a supplement; maybe an entertainer to see who is who and what is what. Do not mix the two. And then there's the power game - which would happen in every area of ​​life. So what did you say at the end of everything - nothing - just some raw jokes put together in an otherwise less filmed direction.
