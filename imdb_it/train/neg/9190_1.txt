This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen some pretty horrible movies in my day, but those take the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn pastry. It is so bad that I believe in one word to describe the way you will feel after seeing that this atrocity has yet to be created. Please do yourself a favor, if you ever want to watch this and watch thirty minutes of that annoying purple dinosaur Barney, then multiply that thirty times and you would still only do a small part of the horror you'd be in store for. In sum, I imagine that you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are willing to be frightened by the worst acting in business and absolutely useless history. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Disgusting
