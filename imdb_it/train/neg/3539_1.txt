Ritchie's first two films were fun and fashionable. Here, break in two recent classics ?? 'The usual suspects' and 'Fight Club' ?? and still goes out empty-handed. <br /> <br /> Although it sported itself as a control (with the deception of the sub-'Usual Suspects "the biggest scam I've ever shot was convincing you it was you" or whatever it was ...) and trying a "Fight-Club" shot on which characters are real and which are the internal manifestations, the film struggles to keep the interest in its second half. From the last third, you know you're driving down a blind alley, and boringly plan to this. <br /> <br /> Against, chess and game theory are all important topics, but Ritchie digs them too superficially and too repetitive to make much use of the material. <br /> <br /> The only thing that keeps the (almost) watchable movie is Ritchie's daring way with a scene and Maurice-Jones's dynamic camera. If Ritchie kept to a more satisfying storyline and succumbed to a tighter editing, there's no reason he couldn't have created another fun gangster whim. <br /> <br /> As it stands, Revolver is a waste of time. The incomprehensibility is not equivalent to depth. If you want to see a great film that makes no logical sense, but makes it a virtue (and, incidentally, that also implies an inexplicable escape from isolation in isolation) look at 'Lost Highway'.
