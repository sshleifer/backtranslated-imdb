Very much a film of the times - extremely long sequences without dialogue, bad flashbacks and an almost all-male cast. The two women who appear have a total of less than 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men. <br /> <br /> O'Toole is compelling every time he speaks; unfortunately, he spends most of his time peering through the bushes. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underutilized. <br /> <br /> The film has a further positive aspect, as it describes many aspects of fascism and British fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of Mosley's graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many films on the Second World War today paint allies as all-good and the Axis as evil, when history tells us that people are much more complicated than that! <br /> <br /> This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and you're bundled up on the couch and unable to absorb something too complex. If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize, this is the movie for you.
