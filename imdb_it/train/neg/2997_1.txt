This film was shot together with the 1992 remake of the famous Conan Doyle novel "The Lost World". And it shows. <br /> <br /> The film begins quite promising, with a ruthless organization that intends to exploit the lost world and Challenger and on his return to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. Everyone is stuck on the plateau and we remain with a weak, boring, very long rehash of the first film. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs (almost never seen) are simply ridiculous. Do we expect to take that stuffed animal that should be a serious ankylosaur? And the tyrannosaurus seems rooted on the spot. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take possession of the silent 1925 version of the Lost World. Incredibly in this age of CGI and other advanced effects, the 1920s version is the best and will remain so until someone eventually decides to do a decent re-make.
