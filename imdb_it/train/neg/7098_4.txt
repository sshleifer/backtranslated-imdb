An interesting idea for a movie, both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the fight he and someone evil have together. When he was younger, Einon was stabbed in the heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him to the dark lord who gave him half of his heart. Now grown up, Einon (David Thewlis) is now the selfish and evil king. Meanwhile, Bowen is using a new friend Draco the Dragon (voiced by Sir Sean Connery) to get rewards for "killing" the dragons. But since Einon has half of Draco's ears, both feel that the pain in one of them is hurt or killed. He also starred Pete Postlethwaite as Gilbert of Glockenspur, Jason Isaacs as Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. He was nominated for an Oscar for best visual effects. Worth watching!
