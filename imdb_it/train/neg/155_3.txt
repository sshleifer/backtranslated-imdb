This is not so much the film as television for children in the big economy. As far as I know, the villain is a giant swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans. This theory seems to be verified by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as "Insomnia". When it was first mentioned that a civilization had been wiped out by insomnia, I thought "Wow! A nihilistic martial arts film!" but no luck. Even if you have to consider it an experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by the long white eyebrows of an old man. Zu Warriors has exactly the same sense that the subtitles are turned on or off. It is not a good sign. I found the special effects between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
