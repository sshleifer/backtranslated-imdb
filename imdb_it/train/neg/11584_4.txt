About twenty minutes into this film, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were rather boring. Occasionally, something pleasant would have happened, but then things would slow down again. Fortunately, in the end my patience was rewarded and the ending of this film was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to justify the session during the first ninety minutes. So I'd say the film was mediocre overall, and considering all the talent in the cast, I'd call it a disappointment.
