I tried watching this movie three separate times. I rented it at night. I spent about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if I had a restful night. I looked at another 15 the next day, almost thrown up as it was stupid ... It wasn't even silly stupid that sometimes it's a fun movie to watch but this movie was just shit with a capital S (if you know what I mean in the world censored in which we live). And in the end, on the third day, I saw more than an hour of stupid things and I didn't like a single moment! Not even one. How this script turned green. Oh boy! <br /> <br /> G <br /> <br /> 1/10 - one is for the cheerleaders ... they deserve at least something for all their hard work.
