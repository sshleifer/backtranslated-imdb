I don't know why this has fans that I do and I don't know why I even gave the score I have. This is absurd. There are many a mystery in which we must suspend disbelief, let the image roll and reach it somewhere before it becomes delusional and some poor policeman must eventually explain what we have seen. But this has very little success and has too long sequences in which nothing happens and has no relevance for anything while we have to listen to a more repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. It's not a mystery, this is a mixture of horror ideas complete with Klaus Kinski in one of his most bland exhibitions. I think he arrived, had a day's work and managed to leave Mr D'Amato to have the others compiled. Ewa is obviously pretty but it is not enough, and in the end we saw too much of her popping everywhere, long after she completely lost interest in this bizarre and pretentious twinddle. Maybe I wasn't really in the mood!
