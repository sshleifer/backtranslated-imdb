Soldier Blue is a film with pretensions: it claims to be a kind of profound declaration on the inhumanity of man towards man, on the exploitation and brutality of the white man towards indigenous peoples; a sharp, immovable and sardonic comment on the horrors of Vietnam. Well, I'm sorry, but it fails miserably to be one of those things. What Soldier Blue actually is is pernicious, trivial, ill-made, dishonest garbage. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer here hit the head saying that it seems to be a hybrid of two completely different films. What is fundamentally a limping "strange couple" love story, clich√© and misinterpretation - Strauss and Bergen overcome their prejudices about each other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - suspended by two nauseating massacres that would not be been out of place in a splatter movie by Lucio Fulci. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for the repugnant, itchy, blood-soaked climax, in which gracious Native American children are variously affected, sliced, dismembered and impaled in love and the foreground graphic and American women at wide breasts are harassed, raped and hanged - no excuse, except for the box office. (The massacre itself, although repugnant in its misplaced intention, is staged and shot very badly, a group of actors around with a bright red paint smeared them, interspersed with some sequences of special effects of beheading / dismemberment - dismemberments "Incidentally, he used real amputees in their filming. This is what I call exploitation.) <br /> <br /> Forget all the pap you heard (including the ridiculous comments that begin and end the film) of this" protest "", an accusation of American brutality against native peoples This film does not provide information on the situation of the Cheyenne, if it did so that it would characterize some Native American characters, it would have led us to know and take care of the innocent without name and faceless that are massacred at the peak, but what we get is the silly story of the white bread of Bergen and Strauss (both disgusting actors yes, at least in this), with so much blood, guts and severed heads thrown to attract the curious. <br /> <br /> it is a terrible sin, because there is a film about the Sand Creek massacre, about all the real life massacres that the United States (and Great Britain and all the so-called "civilized" nations) have participated over the centuries (Iraq?). this is not that movie.
