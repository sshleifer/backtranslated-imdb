Although the film could be "true" for Lewis's book (in the sense that the script was basically word for word, word for word), it could not capture the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this. The mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, demons, ghosts) are * drawn * in, and as in the previous review, the green screen flight sequence was very difficult to digest. I almost laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and their rabbit teeth; I almost cried when I heard the wolf "howl" a man in a fuzzy gray suit basically screaming as loud and childish as possible. <br /> <br /> All the acting is tremendously forced, especially that of little Lucy Penvensie ... I could only experience so much indignation, despair and courage in the fourteen hours of watching the movie. The actress who plays the white witch, in all her instruments, seems to be more comfortable on the stage, where a booming voice, her arms spread and a valiant effort for something Shakespearean would be more than welcome. <br /> <br /> The sets feel claustrophobic, whether the scenes take place inside or outside. Indoors, it's as if the BBC could only afford to spend $ 100 to build a set, so it's very small, and all the characters are constantly huddled together. White Witch Castle is a ruined English castle in ruins, filled with polystyrene statues and bad lights. When the Penvensie children roam the woods - in fact, * any * scene in the woods - it feels like they are simply circling. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems decent in the film is Aslan, but you can bet that the BBC probably blew up the entire budget of the movie about the construction of the mechanical feline. It's nice when it's still and before you talk, but once it starts moving, you can't help feeling sorry for the poor guy who has to be the rear end in the lion costume. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you are a passionate fan of Narnia, you may want to see this version, simply because it keeps every word that Lewis has ever written-- but Lewis was certainly not a scriptwriter, and a lot of dialogue looks big and clumsy on the screen. During the scene where the children are at the Beavers and are preparing to flee from the wolves, the incessant Madame Beaver, "oh, only ANOTHER thing, the dearies, and then we will be ready to go", punctuated by the simultaneous shouts and sighs of children and complaints of "NO, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!" - a scene of comic relief, so incongruent (it is assumed that they are fleeing from imminent danger, they do not ask themselves whether to pack the sewing machine or not), it removes the drama that the scene could otherwise have. In fact, the whole movie is punctuated by the direction of missteps like these. <br /> <br /> I would recommend seeing the new Narnia (Disney 2005). The new film, with updated effects, spectacular computer animation, great timing all around, and a splendid and fascinating White Witch (who plays her part with all the subtle evil of an experienced politician, unlike a banshee scream) captures everyone of the magnificence and magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting from Lewis's original vision (I believe). Lucy is much prettier (NO tooth teeth, YAY!), As are beavers (and full-size), and the bizarre BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine, desperately-Hungry-for-Acceptance-Insecure-and- Angsting-with -an-Inferiority-Complex Edmund that the new fronts of the Disney version. <br /> <br /> Unless you're the guy who likes to waste time making fun of campy movies, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
