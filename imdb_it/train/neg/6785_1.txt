> you are warned that this is a spoiler! > This film is so bad that I doubt I can write enough lines. excellent direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good, in particular Richard pryor tho I would have liked to have seen more. Madeline Kahn and John Houseman were classics. Dudley Other than God bless him he could have done better. John Ritter again would have liked to see it more. In my opinion this failure is totally due to the failure of the writer. Perhaps the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. It's just a pity that so much money went into this boiler, when with a small change here and there in my opinion it would have been correct. They must have paid the standard rates for writers. To produce a laugh.
