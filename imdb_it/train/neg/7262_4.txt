There are some really terrifying ideas in this violent film that, if clearly done, could have turned it from Spaghetti-western blandness into something special. Unfortunately, a country called the HELL is one of the worst modified movies imaginable! The scenes begin and end abruptly, the characters leave for long stretches, the performances (and accents) of the actors are rather incoherent, etc. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a Mexican revolutionary (!) who, after taking part in sweeping away a village, remains to become a priest (!) ... ten years later the village is run by the "mayor" "Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens arrives in search of revenge for the man who killed her husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives in search of Shaw. Everyone yells at each other A LOT and they shoot each other A LOT. There is also Fernando Rey (as a blind man). Performance is not bad, but it is powerfully irregular. Savalas has an accent sometimes like Landau (who is really grateful here). Shaw and Rey prove to be unable to really embarrass themselves and Stevens seems rather vulgar (though a little out of place among the sweaty filth).
