(Spoiler in abundance) This is an absolutely horrible film. First of all he has that average guy. I guess he made a career working on super-doting dad. It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster ... but then 10 minutes later they hurt him again! And so on, this film moves in a terrible real time. At one point, I started imagining it after a few days, until I was reminded that the plot was only the next day ... in the early afternoon again! I'm not really sure who this couple is in real life. First of all they are presented as a sort of yuppie couple from Manhattan who grew up and had a child. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those guys stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they weren't driving Volvos yet. <br /> <br /> OK, then there's Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a small magical statue of Wendigo and communicates his powerful magic to him. Come on ... we're still doing ancient Indian mysteries. Just to bring it home, they move through every Indian statue in their tourist trap north of New York City. American Indians are portrayed in a way that hasn't been seen in this film for decades! Oh, and on Wendigo. In reality it is not the cause of the horror. He does not kill the child's father, which is the most horrible thing in the movie ... he was just killed by a normal grudge hick and a high-powered rifle. The Wendigo only comes out late in the movie to avenge the guy who killed daddy ... oh, but wait, it seemed before Wendigo was a little angry with dad, maybe because he had killed a deer ... so Wendigo Dev ' to have been happy that the father was killed ... but ... <br /> <br /> And so on ... insulting, boring and meaningless. There is no reason to watch this movie.
