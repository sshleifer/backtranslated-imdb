About three minutes into the beginning of this thing, I started moving quickly, stopping only during nudity (why do bad movies always include such beautiful women?). In ten minutes I had finished, and wishing I could get my money from the rental shop. The people who write these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come writers: the bad guys ALWAYS enter the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! This is the way it has been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Furthermore, to add insult to injury, the "twist" was so formidable in the end that it could have come from any action movie written in the last 25 years. Burt Reynolds was fine, but he had to concentrate on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - Run away! Escape!
