** CAN CONTAIN SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The titular topless hero saves another beautiful girl and her father (an eccentric professor whose standard pith helmet is broken in one shot and all in the next) from a moth eaten, dime-store mummy and bad Nazis who want to make another quarter ... build a fourth Reich. Misty's costume, like those of some other wimmen, becomes thinner as the film flows. The last part of the film is dedicated to the protracted harmful action; this movie becomes really boring, very fast, which says more about the creatures behind the camera than the sinuous creatures in front of them. MISTY removes the nominal plot before and quickly, so it dedicates total attention to nudity and soft-core sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to films made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Suffice it to say: if this wonder had been launched out forty years ago, it would have played for years on 42nd Street with WHAM BAM GRAZIE SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it stands, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went directly to the home video. Get yours, fast, before it goes out of print.
