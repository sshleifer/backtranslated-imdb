The film lacks style, I mean original style. everything seems to be copied including the action, the first appearances in the film, the songs, the delivery of the dialogues, etc. etc. Yes, there the employees were original, as at the beginning a machine is shown with the number UP **** and a few seconds later it starts to go down a hill with the number MH ****. This was one of the many jokes in the movie :) Something good in the film? Yes, for Kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in a bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogues and action stunts. That's all. nothing else. So watch it at your own risk and don't blame the director or the actors. The director is already crazy and the actors pity them.
