The ultimate goal of Big Brother, which we know what to think before thinking about it, has been realized. Is it a kind of miracle, or sinister joke, that people wear mental jackets of their own will, turn into twisted and grin forms like monkeys? Films, art, no longer risk the unknown, but conclusions are lost, drained of life. <br /> <br /> "Notorious Bettie Page" is a bland case history, suitable for a freshman feminism course. His lesson is schematic, right-angle and linear: "See how women are objectified, exploited, abused, then thrown into the garbage heap, by a society dominated by men." <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, presumably, was the "pin-up queen of the 50s", the ass of millions of ejaculated men. (All reviewers repeat that phrase, "pin-up queen of the 50s", like a chorus of monkeys.) His story as an American sex bomb is familiar: Southern, abused by his father, raped, etc. In this film she is a naive, an innocent unaware of the itchy interests she serves and shamelessly benefits from. Even if she believes in Jesus, she likes to have fun playing nude in front of a photographic lens - only the healthy American girl-male slave of the supposedly fantastic next door. <br /> <br /> From the mouth of the writer-director Mary Harron herself, Oxford-educated and ex-punk (do you feel the combined rottenness of privileges and "hipness" as I do?): "I feel that without feminism , I wouldn't do it ... I don't do feminist films in the sense that I don't do anything ideological, but I find that women improve my films. " What a welcoming clique. <br /> <br /> The film merely describes the story of a human life, it is subject and purpose it was praised and buried long before the film began. Mrs. Page has a boyfriend, but we are shown almost nothing of their relationship. In reality, there are no intimate or detailed reports in the film. <br /> <br /> Its smug simplicity cannot be ignored. In New York, where Ms. Page does her best to adapt and appease the world of a man, letting herself be bound in the strings of slavery and tied tightly to S & M's black leather boots and bodices, the film is black and white . But in Miami, where he goes to get away from it all, he takes off his clothes and is photographed by a "liberated" woman, the film turns into color. <br /> <br /> Like hell, Harron doesn't do "make feminist films", not "make anything ideological". The ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that it is almost invisible. Big Brother must smile.
