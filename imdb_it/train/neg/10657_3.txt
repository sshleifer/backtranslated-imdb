I had many hopes for this film and I looked at it with many expectations; basically because of Kamal Hassan. He is an extraordinary actor who has marked his steps forever in the sands of time. But this film turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After watching this film, the brutality and violence in the darkness and in the orange clockwork seem much better. <br /> <br /> The Protagonist, Raghavan, is a very bold cop. Who is assigned to investigate brutal serial killings. In this case Raghavan finds the common thread efficiently and is close to solving the murders and puts the psychopaths, two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, behind bars, but flee and launch themselves into a murderous madness again. In the end Raghavan kills them both after saving many innocent lives. These two psycho-killers are the ones that will prevent the public from going to the cinema. Murders and sexual harassment and rapes are shown very explicitly, that the film could have survived without. <br /> <br /> Imagine also that teenagers and children watch this film in the theater and the type of photos that it is intended to paint in their mind are certainly not beautiful. The director, Gautham, should realize that he also has some obligations towards society and his audience. I certainly will never go to the cinema with the name of Gautham on the production list.
