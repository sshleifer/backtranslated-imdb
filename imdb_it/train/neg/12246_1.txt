*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you were to review the film based only on the premise, you might think that you were looking at an average animal-oriented horror movie. The plot is the following. A group of documentary filmmakers heads to an island to shoot a documentary about shark surfing or blood browsing. (I live in South Africa, so he was released as "Blood Surf.") I admit that this seems to have a pretty interesting idea that, if it had been explored further, it could have improved the movie a bit. However, this is not the case since the part of the film about blood is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. <br /> <br /> The script is absolutely terrible. A good example of this is that every time someone is eaten by the crocodile, which is common in this film, nobody seems to care. Most of the person who did in the film was simply toasting the victim in a scene that had to be moving but which is simply ridiculous due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature. Another thing that is really irritating for this film is the fact that they introduce characters that are totally superfluous in the film itself. They present a group of pirates that are seen only by adding another 10 minutes to a merciful short film. <br /> <br /> Acting can be considered mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they didn't have such a terrible script to work with. All in all there is not a single person who has had a terrible impact on me. Every single person seemed to be a fallen caricature and in this way, none of these actors had any impact on me. <br /> <br /> It is said that the crocodile is huge, more than 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well represented by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they provided in the film. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and invented that it makes the stomach spin. With a huge scream of bravado, the hero of the film announces that he has a plan that turns out to be falling down a hill and making the crocodile fit on a peak placed luckily at the bottom of this hill. > <br /> All in all, I would say that this film is one that must be seen to make you believe how bad it can be. What probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budget that served to create a truly terrible film.
