Superhero movies almost always suck, and this is no exception. Its only redeeming quality is the fact that the film could be even worse. I would put 'Batman & Robin' and 'Steel' on top of this movie, so yes, it's so ugly ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a black superhero, check out 'Blankman' it's not a "serious" movie superheroes but at least it's fun.
