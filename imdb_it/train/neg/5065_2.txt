This film is simply ugly. Weak story, weak direction and acting below average. The thing that really annoyed me was the obvious publicity - constantly - for a well-known internet provider. It is obvious that some scenes were written to do just that, advertising. This film is a slap in the face to anyone who has paid for it. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, it's not worth it.
