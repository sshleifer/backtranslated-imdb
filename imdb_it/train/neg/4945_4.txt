Of course, this is not really a hit, nor does it address such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a rather popular German musician, who is loved or hated for his type of acting and this is exactly what this film is about. It is based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen", written a few years ago, but does not want to be precise about this. The film is full of sexual offensive content (at least for the American standard) which is funny (not for other "actors" of course) or stupid - it depends on your type of individual humor or the fact that you are a "Bohlen" -Fan or no. Technically speaking there is not much to criticize. About me, I find this film to be an OK movie.
