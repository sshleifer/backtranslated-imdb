A good cast is frighteningly lost in this slower than molasses and random comedy. Peter Ustinov tries here to give something to life, but the result is a bored person who cannot see all the right beats that could have made him visible. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is horrible. Direct bad Evil modified. Bad acting Written bad You need to sit through a hundred movies to find one so ugly. <br /> <br /> The confusing and excruciating plot concerns Ustinov making his way into an American insurance company to hack their computer and borrow millions of pounds. The way he does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he learns his computer skills from day to day by reading some pamphlets, and computer expert Robert Morley hooded to go to South America and steal his identity ). <br /> <br /> Plot side, Ustinov makes fun of the lonely companion Maggie Smith, who by chance becomes his secretary by chance after getting an apartment in his building. He ends up sharing scenes that have sexual subtitles with Bob Newhart going nowhere, while Ustinov continues to graft the money a little at a time and tries to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then Marries Smith and their fly in Brazil, which has become the cornerstone of almost all the English caper comedies since (Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?) <br /> <br /> The surprise of an ending is more ridiculous than anything that came before. In the end I was thinking that I really had to be off the rocker to attack so drastically. Even a cameo by Cesar Romero didn't help. One of the funniest, least funny comedies I've ever seen, and certainly the worst hair. Do not waste time. If you love this, you have to see better movies.
