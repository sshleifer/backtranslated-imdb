The Prophecy II, what is there to say about it? They completely abandoned the originality of the first film and simply made a Chris Walken splatter movie. It is not even written by the original writer! <br /> <br /> If you have seen Nr. 1 not looking No. 2 it is a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Nr. 1 do not look No. 2! Go to see No. 1 to experience something original and fun
