I feel like I've had, the scam is on, I don't fall in love. After reading the positive reviews (the director was a film critic with Sky for years, so he must have many press mates ready to do him a favor writing positive reviews) I expected a solid acting, an atmosphere, suspense, a strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Unfortunately, "Sixteen years of alcohol" does not keep the promises of the critics, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of the low-budget special effects (which was that cobweb scene for clichés in there?), Fight Choreography realistic and mind-boggling, narrative, clichés and camera angles. <br /> <br /> 'Sixteen years of alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful shots in Scotland, but it's directly downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time creating atmosphere, creating characters we might be interested in, or creating suspense - the director opts to start driving you crazy with the crazy voice of indecency. The protagonists are so indifferent and so abused - the public doesn't care what happens to them, the desperate actors do desperate things ... like this movie! To make matters worse, the "tributes" (typical of a director who tries to pay his debts to the masters of the past) are absolutely cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that raised me and kept me at the cinema, but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative that links a period of time to action. <br /> <br /> For some reason the movie has become increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying. I still saw the whole damn thing! I think I liked the gritty realism attempt in the film, but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with strange and abstract scenes, sometimes useless. You don't need a huge budget to make really moving films, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this movie, half a million is not a bit of money ... SO NO EXCUSES! Sometimes I wonder what actors ... Or their agents thought! <br /> <br /> Pass on this turkey unless you are masochist or mindless anyway .... DON'T MY THING <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10
