Well ... tremor, the original started in 1990 and I found the film very pleasant to watch. however, they proceeded to make tremors II and III. Trust me, those movies started to go down right after finishing the first one, I mean, the blasters of the ass ??? Now, only God Himself is able to answer the question "why in the name of God would they have created another one of these garbage from a movie?" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot even be considered an epitome of a bad movie, because it survives even more. As I tried to sit down, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I hoped profusely that the little girl in the ring would slip into the TV and kill me. did they really think that dressing the people who had looked in the other films as if we were from the wild west would have made the film (with the exact same events) better? honestly, I would never recommend buying this movie, I mean, there are cheaper ways to find things that burn well.
