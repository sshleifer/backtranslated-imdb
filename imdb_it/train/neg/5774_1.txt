This film is a modest effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of much more than this film. Take the bus while apparently anti-racist, it does nothing but scold the whites and degrade the black status quo. The plot of this film is about a group of black men traveling on a bus for the march of millions of Louis Farrakhan's men. The bus has every kind of person you can imagine: gay, Muslim, gangbanger and Uncle Tom (he's still thrown by the bus). There was only one white person on the bus. He was accused of being a racist as soon as he got on the bus to drive. Despite being a Jew and the fact that he explained the situation he became a racist and left the bus. I hate to say that films like this must achieve their own hipocracy and reenforcation of steryotypes. This should not be seen as a triumph but a sad dissapointment. You might think I'm a racist for writing this, but I mean well. Better luck next time Spike.
