Before I start, I love Eddie Izzard. I think it's one of the funniest stand-ups today. Maybe this means I'm going with too high expectations, but I didn't find Eddie funny in this release. I think the main problem is that Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it. But in Circle, it seems like it's going more irrelevant than fun, and it completely lost me in places. Many of the themes he covers have already dealt with before - I even think I recognized some recycled jokes. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD you will find a look behind the scenes of Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not very funny), and a French version of one of his shows. The die-hards will love to see Eddie in a different language, but the subtitled comedy isn't much fun. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Eddie you have already done it or you will buy it whatever you say. If you're just passing by, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you won't be disappointed. With Circle, you probably will.
