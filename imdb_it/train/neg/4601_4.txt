I don't know anything about the writer's or director's previous works, so I didn't bias the film. Based on the brief description of the plot in TV Guide I thought it might be interesting. <br /> <br /> But implausibility has been stacked on implausibility. Every turn in the plot seemed to be an excuse to drag more bloodshed, macabre tricks or special effects. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was professional and Kari Wuhrer looks like a decent actress, but the rest was more than disappointing. It was decidedly repulsive. <br /> <br /> I will not go through the whims of fiction, but I will give an example of what I think of as an explicit excess of blood. <br /> <br /> Chris McKenna goes to an isolated ranch and pulls the frozen body of his previous victim (Wendt) out of the freeze. McKenna had killed Wendt by biting a piece off his neck. Now he feels he must destroy the evidence of his involvement in Wendt's disappearance. (What will the cops do, measure the radius of his bite?) McKenna unwrapped Wendt's head and neck from the freezer bag in which he finds himself, takes an ax and starts cutting Wendt's head. Whack. Whack. Whack. The ax bite continues to chip Wendt's neck. The air is filled with flying frozen nuggets, one of which falls on McKenna's head. (He takes it off when he's done.) McKenna then brings his frozen head out of a small fire he built. He rests his head on the ground, crouches next to it, takes out some photos of a woman he just killed and shows them to Wendt's head. "Remember, we could have really done it if it wasn't for you guys," he says to his head. "Duke, you always liked bonfires, didn't you?" he asks. Then he puts his head on the fire. We can only see it burn, but we can feel the fat sizzle in the flame. <br /> <br /> I don't want this sort of garbage to be censored. I just wonder who likes to see this stuff. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to continue with the rest of the film. Well, I'll mention an example of "implausibility", since I brought the idea. McKenna was kidnapped and locked in a dark and bare shack. He knows he will be overwhelmed by death in the following days. (He literally invited the soldiers to do so). What would you do in this Poe-like situation? Here's what McKenna does about what could turn out to be the last night of his life. Find a discarded calendar with a pin-up girl and masturbate (successfully). Give that man the medal of freedom! <br /> <br /> A monster that looks like Pizza the Hut is thrown into some useless flashbacks. The camera is often held in the hand and shaky. Dialogue has lines like "Life is a piece of itself *** Or it is the best of all possible worlds, depending on your point of view". The use is made of a wide-angle lens that transforms ordinary faces into gargoyle masks. A house explodes in an explosive fireball at the end while the hero, McKenna, walks towards us in the foreground. <br /> <br /> He is also a hero. First he kills a man for $ 13,000 by beating him repeatedly on the head with a heavy statue, then with a potted plant, before spilling a refrigerator on his body. (This annoys him a little, but not enough to prevent him from insisting on payment.) Then, I hope to have the order, he kills Wendt by tearing off part of his neck. He then kills his first victim's wife by mistake and blames his supporters, even though they have nothing to do with it from any moral calculation. Then the chief honcho (Baldwin) burns alive. So, having deactivated the two minor weights, he deliberately detonates them, even if one of them is not completely unpleasant. And we should be rooting for McKenna. <br /> <br /> They didn't even die from cartoons like those in Dirty Harry's movies - bang bang and you're dead. These are slow and painful. The first one - the murder for $ 13,000 - is made awkwardly enough to resemble what could happen in real life. It is not really easy to kill another human being, as Hitchcock had shown in Torn Curtain. But that scene does not lead to any place of any importance. <br /> <br /> Some people might like it, especially those young enough to think that pain and death are things that only happen in movies. Some prostitute things on the screen here.
