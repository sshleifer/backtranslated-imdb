This film is bizarre. Better, it's "weird" strange. I could give you a summary of the plot, or some analysis of the toilet, but I would consider it a waste of time. All those who need to know about this film are two young sisters, an incestuous relationship, a murder, a post mortem mutilation and a very disturbing infatuation. At the end of the film, you feel like you need to take a shower to wash away the dirt, but not in a way as good as after "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club". It's like you're a teenager (or a high schooler being a teenager myself) and you've just done something A: I wish I hadn't done it, and B: I hope the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out. And nobody likes it. My advice is that instead of desecrating your mind and looking at a piece of unbridled film filth, wasting your time on something a little less horrible and watching "Kazaam" (yes, I'd rather watch "Kazaam" than "Mohammed maids" , read in it what you want).
