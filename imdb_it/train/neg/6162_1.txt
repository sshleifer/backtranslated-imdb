"Smokey And The Bandit" wasn't exactly Shakespeare, but nobody wanted it to be. It was a low-level slap, but it had a brain. He had a very clever script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. People came out of the theater smiling. "Hooper" provides none of this. There is no reason to smile. If it is supposed to be a tribute to the Hollywood Stuntman, it makes them seem terribly lazy, providing nothing but poorly choreographed fight scenes and one of the most unconvincing jumps I've ever seen. It all seems fake, filmed badly almost on purpose. Poor Sally Field (like the girlfriend holding her hands apart) has her weaker role, not with a single funny or intelligent joke ("If you make that jump, I won't be here when you come back"). Burt Reynolds continues to look at the camera and wink, but the joke is on any audience that is in "Hooper". * from ****
