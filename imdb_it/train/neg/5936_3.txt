This film was a disaster from beginning to end. Interviews with Bono and The Edge and the artists themselves are interspersed with performances from the "next generation of beautiful losers". This leaves little time for the clips of Leonard Cohen himself, who dominates all the others in the film with his imposing but gentle presence, wisdom and humor. The rest is too busy trying to canonize him as Saint Leonard or as an Old Testament prophet. Many of the performances are forgettable overinterpretations (especially those of Rufus and Martha Wainright) or insignificant underperformance. Only Beth Orton and Anthony were able to reach Leonard's versions within a short distance using a small restraint. Annoying pseudo-avant-garde movements are scattered throughout the film, such as blurred overlaps of red spheres on many of the concert and interview shots, the flickering work of the blurred camera, the use of digital delay on some of Leonard Cohen's comments (rendering more difficult to hear what you are saying) and a low ghostly and pretentious drone under many segments of the interview (an attempt to add gravitas?). Actually, watch the documentary Songs From The Life Of produced by the BBC in 1988.
