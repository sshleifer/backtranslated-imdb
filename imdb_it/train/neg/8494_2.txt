Waiting for a combination of scifi films and period films on Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc., I was disappointed by this senseless pseudoscience of cinema and by the mixture of a true and fabulous story. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has no real understanding of the mathematics, technology or history that constitutes the subject of the film, but is instead working from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This strikes me a lot, since I have been irritated for a long time by the tendency of the arts to trample and to abuse terribly the terms and ideas of science to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life ", Ada:" I am not at all sure that half of life is better than no life ". <br /> <br /> This film does worse than not being able to entertain - disinform. The only redeeming value I can imagine is that it could attract the viewer to know the subject that distorts so severely. It is more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any level of progress as indistinguishable from magic.
