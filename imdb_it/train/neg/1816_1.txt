This film is really brilliant. It crashes through the banality to shit at such a speed that we don't even see common sense and common decency towards humanity that passes by darting. But it doesn't end there! This film hits the bottom of the barrel so strong that it bounces to the point of a ridiculous comedy: this is how Kor the hero Conan of Beergutted with the overabundance of hair on his neck pushes his stuff to swing his sword as if there were no tomorrow (and the way he sways, I'm really amazed that * it was * tomorrow for him, or at least, for his beer gut). Don't miss this movie, it's a fantastic romp of idiocy and pure rudeness! And once you've finished watching this, wipe the tears of joy (or tears of frustration at such an inept attempt at storytelling) from your eyes because some stupid f00l gave these people another $ 5 to make a sequel!
