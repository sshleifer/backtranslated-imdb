The word "1" in the title has a more disturbing meaning for the viewers of this film than for its victims of crime. At least they don't have to hang around and watch this endless movie reach its end. <br /> <br /> The first should refer to: 1 Â° drafting of a script; 1st take used in each performance in the final film; 1st modification in post production; etc., etc. <br /> <br /> The film is not too bad a cast, it's just that everything about the film looks like the worst of the third level, from the idiotic script, to the wooden performances. And while you suffer through this cobbled film together, at the time of 2 hours you want to be put out of your misery. At 160 minutes it is clear that it should have been changed to less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Going into details about the lame script and acting serves small purposes. Even in the same terrible, Lake Placid, at least the performances of Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built from an extremely weak script, were nuanced enough to make the movie laugh. In 1st to Die, one ends up suffering only for the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening scene of the preparation of the suicide of the female protagonist. <br /> <br /> The editing is so serious that it is never introduced to one of the main characters, who I think (it was never said enough) is a DA Appears only in a scene in the middle of a conversation. Obviously the scene in which it was presented to the viewer was left on the editor's floor. And nobody realized that a character who appeared out of nowhere was an unusual ploy. <br /> <br /> In a word, don't waste your time with this. My wife and I wish not. But at least we have created our diversions by commenting at various points in the film as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile, in Cleveland ...." !!!!
