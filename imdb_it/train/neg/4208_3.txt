There really is a nice movie lurking beneath the surface of the layers on layers of cheese that is "the Pagemaster". I discovered this when I looked at it again this morning after having neglected it for years and years. I remember hating it passionately when it came out, but this time I discovered that the special effects are pretty good. The plot is just "the infinite story" with an end-end of creativity, but it is a perfect little movie for all those who want only really fantastic eyes. The animation is incredible, and I particularly liked how the animators make their characters appear and act in a slightly more surreal way than the norm. I give him a vote of three because I would have given him a two (only for the value of the parody) if I had ever decided to watch this movie expecting to make my mind go crazy.
