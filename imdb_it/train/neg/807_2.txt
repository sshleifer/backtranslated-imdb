I didn't expect much from this TV movie. You have to set the bar lower than you would for Midget's limbo for any TBS movie with Antonio Sabato Jr. Yet, he managed to disappoint, even though it wasn't a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Each scene was from memory, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen films and television series that dealt with large-scale conspiracies in the script, leaned back and said: "Il my work is finished ". It's all obvious, predictable, and worse, the actors are forced to look serious (even when the plot developments are ridiculous). Do yourself a favor. Watch "The X-Files" if you're in the mood for paranoia. They manage it better. Also, let everyone know that sitting in "Fatal Mistake" is just that.
