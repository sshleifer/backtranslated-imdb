Now I have just realized that, watching this movie, I have lost precious precious moments in my life, I will never come back. The film is not only poor, it's terrible. It reminded me of every stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia believes that it is a race problem, apparently "white" people don't like it because they have no white actors. Friend, I think you will find the reason why nobody liked this because looking at dry paint is much more fun and fun than this pile of junk. <br /> <br /> Stop making shitty movies
