I commented on this when he debuted for the first time and gave him a "thumbs in the middle" review, pointing out that I would give the benefit of the doubt beyond the first episode. I saw a total of six episodes up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is crap. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong. Everything. Exceeding only the bad animation and the design, the stories are ridiculously complicated and without character development or apparent interest from the writers of this dreck to give substance to any story. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake ... is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham a revolving court system? Or, again, it's just a complete lack of interest for writers to put any effort into other villains (see "no character development", above). <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, every single Joker story is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gasifies people. <br /> <br /> 2) The Joker is preparing to gass the whole city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode that I saw was not a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefande Cluemaster ... the "Think Thank Thunk" episode with the quiz show. This was the single Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I've Got Batman in My Basement." <br /> <br /> I can't really say what I think this show because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Thank God for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. era of Bat-entertainment, returning from Fox days and Kids WB. Such good stuff, and I should have known, could not last forever, unfortunately.
