Isabel Allende's magical and lyrical novel about three generations of a South American aristocratic family has been vandalized. The heavy fiasco of a film that resulted - largely due to a magnificent cast of Anglo actors completely unable to take away the elusive latent mellifluea of ​​Allende's characters, and a Scandinavian directorial hand - was so uncomfortable in his skin I went back to the theater a second time to make sure I didn't miss something vital that could change my opinion. To my disappointment, I had lost nothing. None of Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave were able to free themselves from the trap set for them by director Bille August. Everyone seemed perfectly rigid and resigned, as if, by making as little effort as possible, they expected to vanish unnoticed in adorable sets. (Yes, the film was directed by the artist within a few centimeters of his life.) Curious that the production designer was allowed the gaffe to place KFC products in a scene that occurred around 1970 - years before the birth of KFC. He was then known by his original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Even forgiving this, what on earth is Kentucky Fried Chicken doing in a military dictatorship in South America in 1970? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. "The House of the Spirits" should have been the 1993 film event. Since he was so busy and faithfully faithful to his vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither an event nor an art. And for this, Isabel Allende should have filed a rape complaint.
