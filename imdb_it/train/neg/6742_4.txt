For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based on the haze of my eyes at the end of the experience. Unfortunately for "The Wedding Date", I can only classify the film with 4 of 10 possible tears. <br /> <br /> My apologies to the fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I didn't see much chemistry between them two characters. The premise of the film is a "Pretty Woman" upside down, with Dermot playing the role of Nick, an expensive male escort hired by the character of Debra Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship between customer and customer is supposedly developing. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship between Nick and Kat. <br /> <br /> In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came on the screen, it was a candle and a catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been hired in the role of Kat, the film could have been more dynamic. But as it turned out, instead of reaching Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine in an attempt to pretend that this film had a genuine feeling and romance.
