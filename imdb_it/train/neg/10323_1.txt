I was excited to see a sitcom that was hoped to represent the Indian Candians, but I found this show not fun at all. The producers and the cast are probably happy to receive both positive and negative feedback because, as far as they are concerned, it is discussed! I was ready for some stereotypes and I have no problems with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there was nothing funny about these stereotyped characters. The father "fresh from the boat", who does not understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the modern young Indian who tries to manage his mosque as politically correct (he's a pretty good actor, I just see he's improving). /> <br /> is very artificial and the dialogue does not flow so well. there was so much potential for something like that but unfortunately I think it failed, and I don't really care to watch another episode. <br /> <br /> I still enjoyed watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, it's always a real and natural delight in everything she does, too bad that her daughter in the show doesn't have the same acting skills!
