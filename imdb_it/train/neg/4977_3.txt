This is a rather useless "made-for-TV" science fiction channel that tells the story of Beowulf, especially after the recent 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This film does not enter into Beowulf's story, but takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as Grendel who leaves a kingdom in utter fear and tumult as the powerful Viking warrior, Beowulf is called to free them from the monster. If this is successfully accomplished, the king will no longer have to sacrifice children to keep him at bay. After a few failed attempts, the creature is killed, but is angry and the vengeful mother soon attacks, leaving Beowulf, once again, to lend her powerful actions of courage and strength to defeat her. "Grendel" seems to have been shot on a limited budget and the CG effects are terrible. As I said, this film is absolutely useless.
