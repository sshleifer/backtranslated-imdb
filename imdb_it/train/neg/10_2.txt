This film had many promises, and the plot was relatively interesting, however the actors, director and editors left this film seriously. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the writers, it could have been fine. The acting is made of wood, few of the characters are credible. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has ever mounted it clearly has just learned some new editing techniques and wanted to immerse them throughout the film. There are a lot of quick "flashy" edits in almost every scene, which are clearly meant to be symbolic, but end up being boring. <br /> <br /> I wanted to love this movie and I expected there to be a decent resolution to the breakdown of balance but alas no, it made me feel like I had wasted time and filmmakers had wasted their money.
