This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was disappointed for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 50s that spoke, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such a hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) He was not an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades may have traced its origins to this episode if I did it correctly In fact, the modernization of sex robots is in the news as I speak. <br /> <br /> Robots weren't new to movies or television when this episode was done, so they could at least make it behave like one. His fleshiness would then add a disturbing element. Instead, it becomes a beautiful love story about two humans in the distance. <br /> <br /> The Twilight Zone has always stimulated imagination and credulity. Normally nobody cared. But this episode seemed paralyzed by a Calvinist morality that avoided what should have been masturbation with a car, or even carelessness.
