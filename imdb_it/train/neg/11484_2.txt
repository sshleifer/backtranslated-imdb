Is it just me or that kid is really annoying? <br /> <br /> Hideos's sister spends most of her time chasing the little disobedient so-and-so. As for him, well, I know he's a kid and everything, but his acting ability is almost wood like a dead tree. So far I'm only half way and I'm fascinated by history, but people are in it, disappointing, I just hope it gets better in the end, since I can't help knowing what it is. Although, some seemingly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and in a notebook, indicate that everything is backward, ie Dog is God, Live is Evil etc ... it seems only a little obvious at the moment, but nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (Anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if you're reading this, then fine ... See the previous statement.
