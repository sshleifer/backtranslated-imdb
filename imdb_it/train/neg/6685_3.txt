Although the film takes place at an "Ivy League" college, it was in fact shot entirely in northern Arizona, mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is an absolutely ridiculous scene in this film (if you know your geography of Arizona) that shows several cast members cycling from college to a stream. We NAU are aware that the campus and said Creek (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles apart, and while the journey is all downhill, it would literally be impossible to cycle on that same road!
