This film is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a science fiction movie. The worst science fiction trend is to make your theme a terrible, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian / Huxleyan / whatever vision of the "human future". <br /> <br /> Science-fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take yourself very seriously given the high value for money of their kind. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just invented it, relaxed), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little more understanding of the fact that they're not changing the world with something profound "message." <br /> <br /> Sci fi can certainly succeed at a serious level, as numerous great directors have shown. But there is an immense negative side to the entire concept, which is represented by "Robot Jox", with its low-cost construction of the "future" (a solitary design element: the bizarre, bright-looking billboard everywhere encourage women to have more children) and its painful and heavy "Iliad" parallels (He is NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD'S SAGIO! Actually I didn't understand until I saw the film as the tenth time, but I went to the public school, so filmmakers are not acquitted. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you are a movie fool like me, this downside has one big advantage: I love movies this way, because bad movies are often more "Funny and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. It's a kind of Lester Bang approach to watching the film, I suppose. <br /> <br /> Note: the protagonist of this movie (Gary Graham? Is it his name? I refuse to go check.) It's not so bad give it a try. He's pretty strong, especially when he's drunk / stunned.
