What a huge pile of dung. Pile of garbage. Shot-on-video (REALLY poor camcorder, NOT digital). It is undoubtedly the stupidest thing ever done. The fact that this crap was actually released is completely asanine. Everyone who sees it will become more stupid for looking at it. Seriously. I felt like he had killed several brain cells after seeing this garbage. The positive reviews of this $$ chat were obviously made by the "director" (and I use the term VERY vaguely) himself and / or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a squirrel would honestly like this waste of life. Trust me, stay away from this video. You'll thank me for this. Avoid it like herpes.
