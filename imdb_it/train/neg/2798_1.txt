This movie is bad. If you are thinking of watching it, there is only one decent scene in the film, and it takes about 5 seconds (the topless scene of Amanda Carraway). The rest of the film is horrible. I think school plays probably have better acting. The plot makes no sense. The set was pretty lame, and it wasn't even nice to joke. It was just boring and very bad! I saw it on Starz, so I thought it was at least decent. The mini description looked like it would be fine. The girl apparently kills herself without reason at the beginning of the film, after seeing some horrible music video. The transitions between the scenes are VERY brusque and it's like someone putting a lot of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to change them. Only cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. A bit like my random passage from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks. The audio goes low in some places, where you can barely hear it, then it gets noisy with gay horror screams launched at random points in the film. It's the same sound every time. This is now officially the worst movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> Acting: 0/10 Effects: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> <br /> Lame-meter : 1,000,000 / 10
