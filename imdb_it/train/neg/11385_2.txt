Before starting, let me tell you that my experience of this film may have been influenced by dubbing, which I gather from other comments is the original which is considered inferior by some. Thus, it is quite possible that the subtitles or the seemingly new DVD version would make the difference. I also didn't read the corresponding book; I only know another Japanese manga and may lack a cultural context. <br /> <br /> Potential secondary spoilers ahead. <br /> <br /> I usually like sci-fi stories with dark tints (similar to Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I didn't like this movie at all. Although it was slightly intriguing at first, it became boring when it was only half completed. There are all kinds of problems; let's start with what is probably the most serious: dialogue. The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences; if they are not shouting each other's names for the umpteenth time, they usually make a monosyllable grunt ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc.). This leaves most characters completely underdeveloped and two-dimensional. It doesn't help at all that many of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them far from the stereotypes suggested by the graphics. <br /> <br /> The grunt is augmented by some pseudo-philosophical pseudo-philosophical techno that sounds vaguely and not even inspired by Star Trek standards. There is nothing profound and meaningful here - everything seems random, thrown together randomly by various pieces and pieces of science fiction without any coherence. <br /> <br /> What little of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to start the long final sequence that consists in the escalation of chaos and destruction scenes. Not that there's anything wrong with a lot of chaos and destruction, of course; but in this case you will find yourself asking "what is the point of all this, and for how long until it is finished". The development of the character in the last 30 minutes consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no apparent reason. <br /> <br /> The ending resembles that of 2001 - a bizarre series of images that, far from the resolution or explanation of anything, let the viewer realize that they have just examined a kaleidoscope for two hours. I'm sure some will say that this kind of thing is art; but for me it was just a lot of imaginative use of color and shapes. (Some of the music was also quite interesting). Unfortunately, it's all style and without substance. <br /> <br /> Tired of Disney? Want to watch animated movies that interact intelligently with "adult" themes? I am sad to say that this kind of thing is more likely to be found in "South Park".
