Unfortunately, this is not "the best British hellraiser film", although the DVD cover says this, which is what deceived me to buy it. It is, however, a tribute to many of the great horrors of old films, particularly the Amicus stable. <br /> <br /> Cradle ... is shot in mini dv, but we all know that it has more of a TV sensation than a movie, it can be done much better. Every scene, set and shot seems to have been turned on in exactly the same way (standard button, fill, back configuration), which only improves the economic aspect of the finished piece. The blood content is, frankly, ridiculous. From the first snaps in which we see the obviously frayed foam rubber head of a man, the cheap hammers, the effects of the creatures and the terrible CG, there was nothing that impressed me at all. <br /> <br /> The acting is abominable, from the quasi-comatose detective to the dwarf brummie, via Dani Filth, the least convincing bad-boy horror I've ever seen. Each of the substations is more formidable than the last one and the series always get worse and worse during the execution of the film. Look for the "madhouse" - a semi-independent Georgian house with a cg sign outside and the most bizarre padded cell (and not in a good sense) that I've seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering (indeed, running) on ​​any available occasion. At one point I found myself dusting while the movie was spinning. <br /> <br /> However, it marks one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth's breasts, which I believe is one (um, two) things she has. Once it's out of the way, though, it's all downhill. <br /> <br /> I have heard people say positive things about Alex Chandon, and I would like to believe him, but on these tests I am not likely to. If you want a decent tribute to Amicus, avoid this and go for the Christmas special of the League of Gentlemen. <br /> <br /> Currently fighting with Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows for the title of the worst movie I have ever seen.
