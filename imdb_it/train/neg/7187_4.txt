Here we go with other slasher films, good-looking people and acting by everyone has been really good! <br /> <br /> Few children make phone calls and there the parents are killed by the killer in front of the children! 20 years later they are still friends, they go into huge homes, have fun, drugs and sex (without nudity) for at least half an hour of the movie! Again they start making phone pranks all over again! and then the killer returns killing them one by one and the killer is in GREAT BLACK HAND with ax just like the Urban Legend movie, <br /> <br /> really weird dead scene, really strange times. <br /> <br /> The beautiful slasher film in this part would have given 7/10, but the twist at the end of the film made the whole movie a bit pointless <br /> <br /> The twist killed the movie for me, so I'm going to give it 4/10
