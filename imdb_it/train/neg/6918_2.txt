I went for this movie believing it had good grades. First, it is ridiculous that they are releasing a film originally made in 2001, seven years later, in 2008, here in India. Everything in the film seems dated. Also for 2001 it seems that the film was made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to work out the small budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he's doing in the movie. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene, I lost it while I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing on Jennifer Love Hewitt looks like a devil. He wears trivial and evil clothes and frowns at children at random. As for Alec Baldwin, a scene in which he meets Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly said, "Go home and write better!"
