Considering the limitations of this film (The whole film in an environment - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 actors in total) it should have been done much better. If you have these limits in making a film, how could lighting be so bad? And the actors were terrible, they were talking with a hair under the acting of Clerks, except that it was a funny film, this one had no substance. Well, he tried, but really fails. <br /> <br /> It makes an attempt to self-refer to a couple of parts, but the lines were delivered so badly by the actors that it was simply bad. And the main character of Neal, that pathetic loser. Clearly 10 people in total made this "movie" and they all knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people have no idea how terrible they are. This was done in 2005, but everyone seems so naked that he only knows about the pre-grunge era. Fortunately I didn't pay to see it (Starz on Demand delivers again!) But it was under the title "The Possessed" is not Studio 666, no matter what you do to the title, it can't help this. This could have been a much nicer film - there is no excuse for this bad film production when you have the obvious limited parameters that the filmmakers had when they did it, working within those limits you should do the things you can control and things you can work with the best you can. Instead they thought that mediocrity would be good enough. And that music video, wow, that was bad, I quickly anticipated this. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is right, if you like all the b-movie crap I suppose you'll go see this.
