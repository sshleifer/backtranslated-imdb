Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and the SCTV student are all together in a sometimes funny sketching film. <br /> <br /> However, it is very interesting to watch now, at the beginning of 2005. Twenty years after this movie is supposed to happen, look how many of their gags have become absolutely true: there is a trailer for a fake movie, which probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" that came true with the stupid Arnold Schwarzenegger movie "Junior" There's a commercial parody, which probably wasn't even clever at that moment, for something with Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling" which has now come true with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing" There is a trailer for a fake movie, which probably wasn't even smart at the time , who sees John Candy in a film about a severed head. Watch this trailer and see how similar are the shots and the plot to Basket Case by Frank Hellenlotter !! And finally there is an announcement for a documentary about the late show about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." The documentary's name is ... THE HAST HIPPIES! LOL. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies come true!
