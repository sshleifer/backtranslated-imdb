This film was bad because there was nothing interesting. It was a sort of remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had a great trick and CGI available and a lot of money ($ 100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got is as good as the original movie made for under $ 6 million? Hell no. Therefore, in this regard, the film fails. <br /> <br /> At least in the original film, the scene of the statue of liberty was shocking, but there was nothing shocking about this film, not even the final scene, because you could see it coming. And by the way, if you think about it and I did it, you can understand how the end could come. I just hope I spent the time I wasted thinking about it. <br /> <br /> This film would have been brilliant and fun if it had remained on the lines of the first film and adopted part of "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". Here's how I would write it: <br /> <br /> An astronaut (it should have been a lot more than Marky Mark because he wasn't good enough at treating a movie by himself, so I would have put in three guys) that would have landed on that that they would have thought it would be another planet, meet humans (not dumb), a city ruled by monkeys, be hunted, made friends with beautiful monkeys, discover that they are on earth finding some ruins destroyed, end up meeting crazy human mutants that live under earth, a war breaks out between mutant humans and apes, and then ... well, let your imagination run wild about how you want to end it. <br /> <br /> But my point is that there could have been a lot more in this film. Unfortunately, Tim Burton really knows how to destroy a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He is a rotten director who inspires what people think. It is fashionable, so it must be good, all right. Sorry but no. If someone else had made this film, it would have gone much better and it would have been much more satisfying.
