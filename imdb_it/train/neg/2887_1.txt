I just saw this movie today and it's not only terrible and terrible, but it seems that the director has just made friends with some friends to make a film about a sick man. I also think that this film looks like a porn video with the clear sharp view just taken. <br /> <br /> Thank God I work in a video store and I didn't have to pay because this movie is crap x infinite..DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS FILM !!!!! You'd have a better time to watch Dude Where's My Car than this piece of shit! And that doesn't mean much to that movie. <br /> <br /> The acting is very bad and the film is really unwatchable. I was watching this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I came home and threw up after looking at this piece of dirty film, then took a shower and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had half a mind, I would take the film out and burn it because no one should be subjected to it ... well, maybe members of Al Queda ... especially those we have in custody and even rapists children who are imprisoned in life without words .... just set a clock like an orange clock, and then force these cheese heads to look at it over and over again.
