Towards the end of this thriller, the scanty image of Ally Sheedy's last days is used creatively to create more than one wickedly evil image. It convinces one that, if a bad Bette Davis-type role should come his way, it could carry it forward brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons to see it. If you asked yourself how Sheedy looks in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone be?), Here's your answer. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's crazy sex-hungry woman is really boring, and even if you like this kind of thing more than me, you'll have to admit that the tension weakened during these scenes. The drunken brute of a Savage insurance agent is equally disgusting, but at least it's a small role. Among the main actors, Nicholas Walker does not at all inspire sympathy for the difficult situation of Paul Keller and his acting is of wood. Dara Tomanovich is better and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises slightly. The meticulous and sober performance of Sheedy (although often seems to be an autopilot) is admirable in itself but out of context with the rest. The sets are squalid, the work with the camera is indistinguishable.
