First of all, what's good about the movie? Any nice actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors don't laugh as they act (I would have done it if I had been in their situation)? I do not know. The plot is simple: a Catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I fear there is nothing to learn or to think a little about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "profiler" (the series) with substitute actors and incredible coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives in another victim's house could have a child with the priest, etc. . etc).
