East Palace, West Palace reminded me a little of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra as the cop, and William Windom is the guy. It's a progressive film for China, I imagine, but it also perpetuates the myths about the femininity of gay men: a lot is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The film focuses on an effeminate man who desperately wants to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. Surf the park without fear - he hopes to be taken to the station by the officer. And that actually happens. Then he tells the officer his whole life story while being subjected to a slight torture: forced to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the homosexual wants and, implicitly, the homosexual is challenging the policeman's self-image as a manly man. The story of the gay man's life (which includes flashbacks) is tolerable, but when he begins to describe old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the film becomes unbearable. It becomes a cry of mercy for Chinese gays, who just want to play a traditional role in Chinese society. Sorry, I can't report.
