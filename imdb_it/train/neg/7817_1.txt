at first I was happy to know a new superman movie, even if it would be great but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain who does nothing else, even played by Kevin Spice. <br /> <br /> the evil plan is the same as in Donner's first film, only very forced. <br /> <br /> the script is predictable and simple (all the things Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> the story is the wrong thing, it must be Kevin Smith's script and it could be that it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> everyone reads you later
