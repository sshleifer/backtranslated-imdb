The first half hour of the film had a steady rhythm and introduced the characters. however all of a sudden everything was happening too fast, a reason for Akshey Kumar to date 3 girls, very noisy for the acting of both Akshey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the highlight of the film, Paresh Rawal did well but was not up to its performance in Hera Pheri. overall this film was the biggest disappointment that the film does not do justice to its trailer. save your money and don't watch this movie, look at Hera Pheri and Hungama again! <br /> <br /> summarizing it: an economic theatrical performance and the appearance of the film without history or substance, the plot was extraordinarily perceive the good music of Preetam the man who bought us Dhoom! keep it up! film shot all in one room, the new actors (female cast) were fine because it was their first film but established actors like Akshey and John totally disappointed by an established director like Priyadarshan gives his worst movie ever!
