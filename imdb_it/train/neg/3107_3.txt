Woody Allen did "September", proving that even a genius could ruin it. This is Mel Brook's "September". Monumentally stupid, boring and little fun, I must confess that I didn't look at it until the end. The movie ranks among the few dishonest (eg "The Money Pit", "Out to Sea", "Spitfire Grill") which made me fall asleep or forced to reach the "rewind" button. And I say it, sadly, as a devoted Mel Brooks fan. He should stick to the direct comedy and leave the social comment alone. As the same individual who created "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" could churn out a dog like this is outside of me. To be avoided at all costs.
