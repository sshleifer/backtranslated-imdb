I am sad that a period of history so fascinating and so rich in film material can be transformed into a ho-hum event. Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film, probably the most intriguing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto, and Bloody Bill Anderson, who was crying for his murdered sister whenever he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to look at fictional characters that never developed in anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were still wonderful, as was the location in Missouri. I hope that Ang Lee will make another film of the period and try again, or some other director will look at the enormous wealth of material on which to write a script.
