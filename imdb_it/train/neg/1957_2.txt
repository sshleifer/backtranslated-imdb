I was enjoying this movie most of the time, but I kept hearing that I was watching a children's movie. honestly I think someone wrote a script and then, during filming, decided to add blood, nudity and language. it was a big disappointment. there is the one who believes in the magic of children that exists in films like "babe" (the pig) or "angels in the outfield" that defeats the fairy of the wicked. parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and use this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when I bought this film, I thought it would be a b-film response to the terrible darkness; somehow they manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of money, but they don't. they made a worse film and probably lose the same proportion of money lost to darkness.
