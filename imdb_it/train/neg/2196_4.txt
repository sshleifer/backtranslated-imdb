The Brain (or head) who wouldn't die is one of the most considerate low-budget exploiters of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a repulsive sexist script could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are often expressed by the female protagonist, Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines, I-V's and pincers - seem to confirm that the film should have simultaneously exploited and criticized gender stereotypes. Shades of Helena Boxing undervalued. <br /> <br /> Genderisms are as abundant and irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, too dramatic and unbelievable, and the acting is simply OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because a thought clearly went into it. I'm not really sure what the real objective of the film is, but it seems clear that you're looking for an unusually sharp and raw horror (without the blood and courage that today's audience expects). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the Brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie, and none of the characters is particularly nice. <br /> <br /> All things considered, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the beginning Sexuality American pop sexuality, from the point of view of a woman kept alive despite her missing body after what should have been an accident of fatal car. Her lover is threatening to sew a fresh, high-quality body on her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably not disputed by all this and forced to make friends with a creature that is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the clich√© of the 50s / 60s about the evils of science that are at a distance. <br /> <br /> Recommended for science students B and graduate students in gender studies. O / w not recommended.
