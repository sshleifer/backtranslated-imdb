don't watch this Serbian documentary and Serbian propaganda is looking for this documentary and you will see facts and truths http://imdb.com/title/tt0283181/ <br /> <br /> The documentary series about the Death of Yugoslavia (five episodes) it is a carefully compiled and researched account of the vast bloodshed that marked the end of old Yugoslavia and went through almost the entire first half of the 1990s. It includes a huge amount of news and interviews with both "Yugoslav" and non-Yugoslav parties. The only real "improvement" that could be made to this incredible result would be the inclusion of subsequent developments in the Balkans since the program was made. This was done in the late 1990s for a repeat of BBC television, but the addition of some even more recent events would help complete this admirably detailed and shining work. Perhaps another whole episode could be justified? The very concise title of this documentary was made even more appropriate by the possible abandonment of the term "Yugoslavia" by today's Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro - a very late and formal admission of what occurred years earlier. /> non-fiction as in "Yugoslavia: The Avoidable War (1999)"
