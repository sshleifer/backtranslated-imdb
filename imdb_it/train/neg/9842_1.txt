It seems that everyone in this film is channeling Woody Allen. They stutter, stop and still stutter. Only for DeNero fans REALLY diehard! Try to look edgy and artistic - but it looks like a very low budget film made by university students. The most used word in the whole film is "hum". The film, however, puts the atmosphere between the late sixties and early seventies. If you like movies where people are CONSTANTLY talking to each other, horrible lighting (even if it's for "art"), and it makes you feel like you're sitting in a lame political meeting, then you might like - but you must be really bored I found this CD in the dollar basket and now I know why.
