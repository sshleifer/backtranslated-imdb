I wanted to see it for two reasons. One was the remake of High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart part was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with a certain subtlety, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance is getting bored watching Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters wondering what he's doing in this movie. I don't even want to compare her to Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they had to use the dog story again! Surely they could have invented different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it pleasant to see the same location in which they shot High Sierra, but this adds absolutely no quality to the film. <br /> <br /> It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-film noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it again ...
