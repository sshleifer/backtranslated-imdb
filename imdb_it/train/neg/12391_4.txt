Manipulative drama about a glamorous model (Margaux Hemingway) who is raped by a geek but unbalanced musician (Chris Sarandon) - to whom she was introduced by her younger sister (played by Mariel, the sister of real life), of whom she is a music teacher . While the action of the central court draws attention - thanks above all to the exhibition by Anne Bancroft in the role of Hemingway's lawyer - the film is too often simply lucid, but also dramatically unconvincing: the jury apparently takes the part of the musician because a) the girl invited the assault due to the sensual nature of her profession and b) she was not offering any resistance to her alleged assailant when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple sleeping together. What the hell?!; was clearly linked - what resistance could it offer realistically? <br /> <br /> The second part of the film - which involves Sarandon's rape of his sister, who curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE (2002) in a tunnel - is rather invented: Mariel's character should have known better than trusting Sarandon after what he did to his sister, but Margaux herself madly takes up the line of work that has indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately! The culmination - in which Sarandon gets his sweets, with Margaux that suddenly turns into a fearless and resourceful vigilante - is, however, a pleasure for the crowd in the style of DEATH WISH (1974); incidentally, the ubiquitous Italian film magnate Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films. <br /> <br /> It is worth noting that the lives of the two Hemingway sisters have had different turning points (this was the cinematic debut of both): Margaux's career never took off (despite his indisputable good looks) appearance and laudable participation here) - while Mariel would soon be nominated for an Oscar for MANHATTAN by Woody Allen (1979) and, curiously, she would have been the glamorous victim of violent violence when she tested the role of real life "Playboy Centellafilo" Dorothy Stratten "in the Star 80 by Bob Fosse (1983). With the additional pressure of a couple of failed marriages, Margaux took refuge in alcohol and eventually died of an overdose in 1996; Chilling, the Hemingway family had a history of suicides - in particular the grandfather of the sisters, famous writer Ernest, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961.
