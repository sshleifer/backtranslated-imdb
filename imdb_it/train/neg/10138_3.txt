Over the years I've seen a lot of these Segal movies direct videos, and everyone has the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the level of entertainment is at a minimum. Of course, the action sequences were fun, but it was more or less like this. Seagal was really at its height when he made movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision (at least on the action plan), but in the last ten years, these types of films that play in Segal do not meet his previous qualifications. <br /> <br /> the more positive side, the film made good use of time, like some of the action sequences and the use of wit. Just when the film seemed to simply drag, a beautiful action scene took him out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more than Segal's films would do better if he wasn't the only one the fans recognized in the film. Supporting actors and actresses is a very important thing, and if your current films had prominent actors and actresses, perhaps the film will get more popular results.
