I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Comedy, Drama, Fantastic, Sci-Fi genre, but given the actors involved, I thought I'd give it a go. The tone of the film felt embarrassing, it went through parts of every genre, but it was never quite balanced, so in the end I gave up trying and concentrated on cinematography and individual interpretations, which I thought were overall good, considering each character it had little depth due to the nature of the story (don't give anything here). I must say that it seemed much longer than its 96 minutes of autonomy, and not in a positive sense. In the end I was looking for closure, a bit of satisfaction but it wasn't the ingenious or ingenious piece that I hoped it would be. I think Tony wrongly thought that what he did at the end of the film gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill-conceived conclusion. In the end I feel betrayed. IMO would have been better left alone without the "final" as a piece of art ... right. Or ... I may have completely lost the point :)
