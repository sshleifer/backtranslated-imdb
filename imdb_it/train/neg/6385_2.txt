Gayniggers from Outer Space is basically summarized by its name. Running for only 27 minutes, he describes a spaceship of gay blacks who come to Earth to free men from women. While I see a little meaning for the plot, it is also very illogical. Of course, it had to be a comedy / parody of society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so I succeeded. <br /> <br /> The special effects are horrible. When the ship floats above the Earth, you can see the stars zoom in for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning seem fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors do not convince, the characters are messed up; in general, the whole thing is not taken seriously. If you exceed all the aspects that make it a bad movie, it is very accessible and easy to see until the end. Some parts are hilarious. But overall, the only thing you need to remember is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever. <br /> <br /> Since it is a short film and has some fun aspects, it is not the worst thing to see. But it is illogical and has little value in the long term. I can't really recommend it; if you look at it, do it for the unique concept, not for the quality.
