I can summarize this movie using 20 words or less. Too predictable of a plot with the potential to be fun but instead collapses on his face. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely move this movie with a single star, but I decided to get it up to two stars because Julie Bowen is smoking a lot and gave me enough candy to keep me from ripping the DVD out of the car and blows up with an M80. My advice, take the rental fee of $ 4.00 you would have paid to watch this movie and send it to me directly as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of sitting in this wreck of the train, or you might want to send me the $ 50.00 replacement cost you would have been charged from taking your twelve gauge to use this piece of garbage as a clay pigeon shooting practice.
