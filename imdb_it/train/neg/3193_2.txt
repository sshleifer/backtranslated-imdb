I can count (on the one hand) the number of good films with Joe Don Baker. This is not one of these. <br /> <br /> Endless chase scenes, dull dialogues and terrible interruptions of continuity have made this film a privileged choice to get the send-up on MST3K. <br /> <br /> And this is the only way I could see this ...
