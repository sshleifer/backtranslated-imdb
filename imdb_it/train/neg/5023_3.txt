No one, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the Divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" is a great example of why. Even if at times she tears the part, look at it when she tells Raliegh to write the lyrics of a song that her ladies are about to play: at that moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to govern and rule in an absolute way! Other times, it's over with the flavor of the script. When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she becomes weak and cunning. This has the further effect of undermining his authority: when he blows his stack and threatens to dispense justice, it is difficult to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm, letting us see how Essex was able to de-worm her into Elizabeth's heart, but is totally incapable of transmitting the complexity and pure evil of man. Furthermore, it does not help Essex to be badly underwritten. Why is this hot head who wants to overthrow his Queen - even if she swears allegiance to her - except that it's more blood-blue, therefore, more "worthy" of domination? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He doesn't run the risk of losing the favor and we know where Essex (and his head) goes. So why risk your head by accelerating the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the money he was given? He doesn't even bother trying to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage. He should have finished with Elizabeth the first time alone at the Tower; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is not necessary. The costumes are fantastic. And is it me, or does Bette look exactly like Susan Sarandon?
