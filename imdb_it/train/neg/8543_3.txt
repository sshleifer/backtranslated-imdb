I have to admit that after about 30 minutes I had to go fast through this poorly transferred DVD - NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the "plot". But someone mentioned the opening scene: a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and is impaled on the grass in the front yard! I guess the boy managed to do it, it was never explained. Very exciting opening. <br /> <br /> I wish it had been a film written or thought better, because what we have left if it is rather stupid and a film that makes no sense is not a "smart" film, it is just a poorly executed film. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a cleaned up version and if there was a missing movie, I'd like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a strange little film that is the best if it is forwarded quickly!
