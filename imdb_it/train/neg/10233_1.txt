Many words come to mind when one thinks of captivity. Among these: disinterested, introverted, unsuspected, non-descriptive, unfathomable and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> I hated those films from the mid to late nineties that were basically Scream scams but these new Saw knockoffs are starting to make those classic movies look like. They continue to follow the same demography that those other films have had so much success in doing, but now they add a new level of degeneration that makes girls from twelve to fourteen have the goal of feeling hardcore and fashionable. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bunch of boring shit! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name hasn't been attached to anything good since 1993! Even so, I was still surprised to see that it had something to do with something so ugly! Has anyone been surprised when the film's love interest turned out to be one of the psychopaths? Didn't anyone know when they first saw it? Only someone who has never seen before in his life, has ever seen another movie!
