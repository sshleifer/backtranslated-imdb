Well where to start here? Straight hair presents me with a bit of a dilemma. If this film had come out of Italy in 1975, for example, directed by Ruggero Deodatto and played by David Hess, then I'd like to shoot it faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to the grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed produced his own picture, in England, and with the same budget that would have led Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowan's leg into a machine gun. Because if you want to play bingo at Grindhouse, let me call the "numbers": <br /> <br /> 1. A rich and greedy career woman meets a little rough on the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible way , equally implausibly, gets the most for him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Free shots of a high-flying career woman in various states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Development of complicated and highly unlikely plot that creates characters that exist only to do what they do and that cannot be imagined to have an existence outside of the scenes in which they find themselves. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. Scene of unnecessarily graphic rape perpetrated by a band of males without any perceptible depth of personality or background if not to be raped. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotwise, Straightheads is pretty basic stuff: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party in a pile of campaign owned by his boss. On the way home, they upset three locals in a revenge Landover giving Dyer good footwear and an Anderson group rape. The couple then began to take revenge. So far, so "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "I Spit On Your Grave", etc. Etc. So why didn't I think much about this movie? A number of reasons: I imagine that first of all, having the likes of Gillian Anderson in the cast, prima facie, lead me to expect better, but it's the total lack of honesty here than they do anymore. <br /> <br /> Because every time someone sits down to watch Hess and his retinue terrorize women and kill their men in those 70s pieces, so they always know exactly what they are getting - low budget designed quickies solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator. The bad guys terrorize and kill the goodies, the goodies upset the bad guys and kill them, and everyone returns home satisfied, their desires to see some violent slap and safe violence in the knowledge that the world order has been restored. <br /> <br /> However, as a writer and director, Dan Reed clearly believes that straight hair has much more to say about the state of the human psyche, and tries desperately to absorb his film with a philosophical depth that simply does not 'is . For example, when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers, they discover that one of the rapists has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men she is with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction, so that his two companions would have diverted attention from his daughter !!! The casual and bold way in which Reed drops this little revelation in the plot is simply stunning, it's almost as if he expected this simple reference to pedophilia to be enough to throw the public's moral compass into overdrive and let them leave the cinema thinking that I just experienced something significant. To make sure we understand it, at this point we are shown a sequence of the rape sequence for a second time, apparently from the point of view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter, but Reed assures us that we get many more shots than Anderson abused and raped through the hood of his car. <br /> <br /> After being informed of the reasons for having raped her, Anderson ties him to a table, silences the commercial end of a sniper rifle (complete with a bulky silencer, in case someone was not ' clear on the phallic images) on his jacksie but does not dare to pull the trigger, telling Dyer (who has no such moral scruples) that 'it is over'. Dyer argues the opposite and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their Cambridge rooms with tea and sweets. It is almost unwatchable due to its redundancy. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, Mrs Anderson recites her courage in the film. It's obvious that she wants to leave Scully far behind and, bless her, she certainly does; One wonders what would Mulder do with his old crouching partner to take a hole in the road and then bugger a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he has done in virtually all the films he has made to date - that is, he plays a joyous type of guv cockney chappie with a mischievous smile, a cheeky patter line and a face that most some people would never get tired of punches. This is especially true in the final scene where, after killing his assailants in cold blood, Dyer looks into the camera, which I am sure is meant to be, a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathize with the hand that the fate has faced him and the moral dilemmas that he had to overcome, but instead he remembers much more Oliver Hardy who looks exasperated at the camera after Stan has landed him in another nice mess. Which, incidentally, sums up this film quite well.
