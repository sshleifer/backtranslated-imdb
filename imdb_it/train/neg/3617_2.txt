Really a bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later he kills a sociology professor, end of scene. A semester later (hey, that's what the title said) a new professor of sociology is at school. He befriends another female sociology professor who works there and starts attending another professor. The students are all bored, as are we. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate how much time has passed. The scenes are pretty short, and cut to different characters somewhere else, making little progress of any kind. A lot of scenes involve characters who walk and talk, or sit and talk, and are of little use. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the passage of unclear time means when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? And besides, at least one of the dead does not seem to be missed by others. <br /> <br /> The killer manages to kill a person by stabbing her in the breast, another by stabbing him in the horse and another by cutting his forehead. Was his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The videotape cover has a cheerleader: there are none in the film. The back cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and a menacing suit a group of women in a dorm room. The central red in the photo is in the film, but no one ever wears such a dress, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one on one.
