I am the type who usually keeps the opinions for himself, but I just came back from this movie and felt that I had to express my opinions. Let me tell you I'm a big horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I really like to see just a bit of good script and character development. I know they are often missing in horror movies, but at Prom Night it seemed like he had never made any effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat there is suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yes, the night of the dance didn't have any of this! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Does the night of the dance have that? No, he has a nice guy with a pretty lil knife. And when all else fails ... at least the horror has its guilty pleasure of making it fun like cold blood and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well, when you have a PG like a horror movie like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So, with all these missing elements, I ask .... does this still count as a horror movie? No. I would call it more than a comedy. The people in my theater were laughing more right now, when they saw "Semi-Pro" which was actually going to be a comedy (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I'll have to abandon the new horror. All the good horror movies of the good old days have been turned into garbage, so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it didn't even know it was a remake! Which drove me crazy! I wonder what will happen when there will be no more movies to redo? Where will the horror go after ???
