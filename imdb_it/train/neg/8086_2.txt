When I first heard of "Solar Crisis" and then took the role of the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a film with such a great cast before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that includes outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is a tremendously narrow and claustrophobic feature; everyone seems to be squatting close together so the camera doesn't have to pull too far back. <br /> <br /> And the effects, although good, are quite overwhelming; we are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a group of scientists and soldiers fails to divert a deadly solar flare. But in addition to screaming, sweating and a red glow on everything, there is no sense of emergency. <br /> <br /> Don't start talking about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle and others are doing in this film without even bothering to act with any feeling for the material is anyone's hypothesis. You wonder who other condos are not paid in Hollywood .... <br /> <br /> And until the end ... Well, let's say he is tense and intriguing but he is too little late in an effort like this. If he had kept that kind of rhythm throughout the film, maybe I would have heard of "Solar Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mainly for lost opportunities and bad career moves. <br /> <br /> I wonder how does Alan Smithee keep his job by doing junk like this?
