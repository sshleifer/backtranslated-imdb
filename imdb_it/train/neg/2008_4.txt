No mention if Ann Rivers Siddons adapted the material for "The House Next Door" from his novel of the 70s with the same title, or someone else did. This Lifetime-like film was directed by Canadian director Jeff Woolnough. Having read the book a long time ago, we decided to risk it when the film showed a cable version of what was clearly a film made for television. You know when critical moments precede advertisements, which obviously aren't found in this version we've seen. <br /> <br /> The star of the film is Lara Flynn Boyle who sports a new look that has thrown this viewer into a curve due to the aesthetic transformation that this actress has gone through. From the new eyebrows to other parts of her body, Ms. Boyle is hardly recognizable as Col Kennedy, the character at the center of the mystery. This was not one of the actress's best moments in front of the camera. This applies to the rest of the mainly Canadian actors who deserved better. <br /> <br /> The film has the feeling of a cross between "Desperate Houswives" with "The Stepford Wives" and other more well-known features, combined with a slight dose of creepiness. The best thing about the film was the house that serves as the setting.
