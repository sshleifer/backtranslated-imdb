Let's put it this way. I actually have this movie. I get what the writer / director was trying to do. I understand that dialogue had to be dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot had to be non-climatic and stale. This was what the writer / director was doing. A very very very dry humor / comedy. With all this understanding, I still think the film has been sucked. It seemed that the writer / director was trying to recreate Napolean Dynamite with this film. It had all the same characteristics. The main character also behaved similarly to Napolean. But Napolean Dynamite was actually fun. His script worked. This film is not. It has no purpose. Well, let me reformulate you. Its sole purpose is to rip the Dynamite Napolean and try to capture that aspect. Too bad it didn't work.
