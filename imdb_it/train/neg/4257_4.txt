"Dracula II: Ascension" is the story of a group of medical students who come across Dracula's body. When a mysterious stranger appears and offers students $ 30 million to collect the body and steal the blood for the auction, it is an offer they can. Gradually the students find themselves inexorably chased by a killer Vatican vampire! "Dracula II: Ascension" is a horror film that is a bit funny and has many flaws. The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is rather mediocre. are some good effects of the gore as the scene of the double decapitation, but there is not enough violence for my taste. The film quickly becomes boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense. If you like modern vampire movies give it a try. atmospheric vampire coolers from the 1960s and early 1970s like "Lips of Blood", "The Brides of Dracula" or "Lemora: A Child's Tale of Supernatural" to name just a few out of 10.
