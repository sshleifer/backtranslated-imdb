To put it simply, I don't like westerns. And having never had one from beginning to end, I decided to watch "My Darling Clementine" and see it all the way, no matter how painful it was for me. At the beginning it was atrocious as expected. I found the acting laughable, the boring scenario (your sweet standard, horses and cowboys) and the music and its timing staggered to the edge of pain. However, after mentally speaking to myself to fight, after the first 20 minutes I started to be a little easier for me to bear. Focusing on cinematography, and how John Ford managed to make even the most boring (boring in my opinion) situations is quite surprising at times, he made it much more interesting. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I can't go so far as to say that I liked the movie at the end of it. However it was done well enough to make me sit up to the end, and this in itself impresses me.
