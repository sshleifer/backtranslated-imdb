This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. However, the little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris who imitate Christopher Walken, is what makes this movie fun. Alice's way of smoking, drinking and disturbing when her name is called is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for the imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken for allowing this to be in the film.
