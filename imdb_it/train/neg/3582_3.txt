No, it's not the horror movie ... This is actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a 1927 silent film featuring two boxers and the woman standing between them. He loves the boxer known as Jack "One Round". He loves it until the sample arrives, that is. Although she marries One Round, she begins to flirt openly with the champion until the final boxing fight final between One Round and the champion. Back at the corner of One Round, just when things seem darker, and miraculously find the inner strength to win the fight and win back his wife. <br /> <br /> This film was very early in Hitch's career, but the limits of time must not have made him make a lasting film. Although there are special film tricks and some comedy remedies, this film does not stand up to any of his latest works. It must have been extremely bold for the time, though, with the shameless adulterous wife. This may have been the recall in 1927. Looking through all these old movies, it's amazing how I think they could be redone on today's screen and really come out. Maybe I should be .... <br /> <br /> Skip this movie unless you plan to watch all of Hitchcock's movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
