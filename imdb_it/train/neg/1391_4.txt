Before this TV movie started, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the final episode of the series was aired and many of the originals of the series were gone. There is no president Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, in the penultimate episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left the B-5 permanently. Now for this film they brought Garibaldi (who wasn't in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor make a brief and irrelevant aspect. But since much of the old chemistry has disappeared, this film is already severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) being taken to Babylon 5 in search of a globe full of souls that had been stolen from a deposit hidden by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all rather silly and useless. Yes, yes, the station almost exploded, but it was saved and everything, but frankly I thought it was a case of "been there - and done much better in the past". <br /> <br /> The secondary plot, provided more for the relief of the comics, was much more interesting, given that an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command were not sure what to do and when they tried to pressure them to close them, they were slapped with a cause. This was fluff, but it did provide some laughter - something that the intricate plot was definitely lacking. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sheen did a good job at the beginning playing Should Hunter - with her wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly during the episode he fell out of the character. This should have been identified and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict is only for the totally tough B-5 dice (like me). Others who see may presume that the series has been sucked in - which is a great injustice. This is a great example of a show that does not know when to stop.
