Many King fans hate this because it started from the book, but the film is a different medium and the books should change when they make the leap. Nonetheless, the film fails completely, but fails entirely in film terms. I'd like to hit people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow the question "Really ... exactly what scene scared you?" Any fan I asked for is silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent fright (there are none ...), names the shtick "Squeezing the grape-shot-of the elevators". If you are afraid of this, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you are easily scared. I just looked up as I watched these z-grade horror ideas playing in this schocky, incoherent film. <br /> <br /> A place that deviates from the book and is really bland is the tedious work the film does to get Mr Halloran up to the Ostlook just to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that Halloran takes ALWAYS to come down. Truly one of the most stupid sequences ever staged. <br /> <br /> Oh, and a nice choice for Mr. Halloran Stanley's work! The African-nymphomaniac black light really adds to the mood and the development of the character of a horror film. Has there ever been a more "off", shooting out of place in any film ever made? <br /> <br /> I consider it a miracle that in the end I was able to get around this excrement, and I agree that Kubricks 2001 is a really important film, given the immense 'ill will' generated by both this stupid, stupid film, both from the cult of Kubrick fan-fans, inarticulate, who could not describe an idea at work in it with every film resource in the Library of Congress in front of them. <br /> <br /> Launch into the eccentric exaggeration of Jack Nicholson, the introduction of stupid one-liners in moments of tension and the performance nominated by Razzie by Shelly Duvall and you have a very lousy movie.
