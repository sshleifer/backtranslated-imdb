This is what I found myself saying from time to time in the 3rd act extraordinarily inept of this excuse excuse for a movie. First of all, the effects of the computer are absolutely amazing! Those computer wizards really deserve a pat on the back. The rest of the film, though ... <br /> <br /> None of the characters play realistically, especially in the aforementioned 3rd despicable act (I promise I won't give it away, but believe me, it's not worth keeping secret!). A lot of laughs in the film come involuntarily, like when they try to explain that an invisible man's eyelids don't work. Please, give viewers more credit than that !!! <br /> <br /> Some of the sexual aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do, after all, if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These problems have been treated in a much more intelligent way in the classic The Invisible Man of 1933. There is a scene of violence in particular that is so incredibly ambiguous and is not mentioned once afterwards. If more attention had been paid, Kevin Bacon's mad scientist might have made more sense. <br /> <br /> The film would actually be much more successful as a porn, since the premise could actually be made in a unique and interesting way. But this piece of work ... go and see something else. Or not, and live with the consequences! <br /> <br /> 3/10
