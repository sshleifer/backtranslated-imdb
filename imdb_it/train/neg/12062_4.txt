When it comes to great combinations of directors / actors, the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between them goes from a great mediocre action entertainment. Unfortunately Kinjite: the Forbidden Subjects fall into the latter. <br /> <br /> It's sad because Kinjite could have been much better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to create the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to get cheap jollies because the love story in his marriage is over. It may have been good for another film, but it has no purpose here. <br /> <br /> A police drama directed with Charles Bronson as deputy policeman who saw a little too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against the Orientals. Even that part could have used some explanation. But he will have to overcome it if he and patient patient Perry Lopez find a captured Japanese girl. <br /> <br /> The time Bronson spent in the vice team told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A fashionable and assassin magnate played by Jaime Fernandez is the boy and he and Bronson have a certain history. In fact, in the best scene in the film, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point Fernandez happens to find Bronson and Lopez in a delicatessen all night and this after his rolex snack, sprays the place with an Uzi that kills everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that that little incident would have had more than a couple of LAPD deputy cops after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> Still there is a very tough justice at the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie was still better. This was the last film by the Bronson-Thompson team and the last director of J. Lee Thompson. He should have gone out with something better.
