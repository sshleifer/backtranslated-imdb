**** Do not read this review if you want the shocking conclusion of "The Crater Lake Monster" to be a total surprise **** <br /> <br /> A claymation plesiosaur rises from the depths of Crater Lake to devastate a group of local rednecks, not to mention the fast forward button. Calling the amateur "The Crater Lake Monster" means exaggerating the obvious. If you're not a fan of low-budget drive-in movies, you probably wouldn't be here watching. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that when there is no monster action in progress, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, as it is completely designed in the way it sets the main action sequences. Nothing is too bizarre for "The Crater Lake Monster". He explains his dinosaur by blowing up a meteor in Lake Crater, "overheating" the water to the point where he incubates a dinosaur egg that seems to have rested at the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have stayed there for so long and remained uncovered and vital, wouldn't it have "overheated" the water at such high temperatures that most of the lake would have evaporated? Apart from the presence of some token fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence that the water is warm except for a few lines in the script. <br /> <br /> The script is filled quite obviously in some sequences, and will do anything to bring the characters close to the lake so that they can be threatened by the dino claymation. A couple just passed through car problems and while their car is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head to Crater Lake. Hmmmm ... do you think these strangers in the story could be there, so they will come across our monstrosity of the title? In a sequence that is simply bizarre, a drunk steals a liquor store and decides to kill the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of alcohol. A car chase follows, and you wouldn't know ... they end up right on the lake. Snack for Cratey! Yes, it's not hard to understand, and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. <br /> <br /> The shamelessness of all this is captivating, and I really like "The Crater Lake Monster". I just can't do it. There is not enough to go on, and this is more of a movie to wear during a party, because you could talk about it directly and it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The film has a streamlined list of things that concern it, the most important is the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head that is dragged into wood through the water and a fully realized claymation insert that looks really pretty good. There are also a couple of adorable balls and they carry most of the intentional humor in the film. An unexpected ending lets us cry the death of both the monster and one of our beloved balls, so every good thing about this movie is dead in the end. Why was I so struck by this conclusion? Was it the dismal song played during the credits? Or was I just crying inwardly for the time I lost watching movies like this?
