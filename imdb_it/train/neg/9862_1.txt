I couldn't believe it when I put this film in my DVD player. I thought I'd have a good laugh, since I played D & D for half my life. I had to turn it off since I had company and they were wondering what the shit I was looking at was. <br /> <br /> I finished later, and I should have left it to the soft-core gay clown porn in the beginning. No, they manage the range of jokes, jokes, incest, racism, disguising themselves as KKK ... This film is decidedly mean for anyone who has ever played D & D. No wonder it looks like Real D & D wouldn't allow them to use their game. Who would like their name to be attached to this?
