I imagine that when Hitchcock's scholars and experts find themselves, the discourse is not of the great films of the Master as "North By Northwest" or "Strangers on a Train", but a less known effort like this of 1931, dark and seriously imperfect , which showcases the great director in a nascent form. <br /> <br /> Emily and Fred Hill (Joan Barry and Harry Kendall) are a middle-class couple from London who strive to stay ahead. He envies their fate; she accepts it. The change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying that he will arrange them so that they can enjoy a life of luxury globetrotter. They make plans for a world cruise. But their problems have only begun. <br /> <br /> Just ask Richard Hannay, Roger O. Thornhill or Marion Crane. Well, Marion is indisposed at the moment, but you have the idea. Travel and Hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, preparing one for a dangerous journey at best. This is perhaps Hitchcock's first foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable one. Hitchcock tries to mix the comedy with another element, in this case the domestic drama rather than the suspense, but the two do not coexist, at least not here. <br /> <br /> The hills are a flat, flat pair, without chemistry or personality. When they find themselves at the Folies Berg√®re, in the form of a transversal cut with films that look ten years older than the rest of this film, they are upset by women's clothes. "The curtain has risen too early!" exclaims Emily. "They're not dressed." <br /> <br /> When the hills move away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems pity to kill more than one tragic thing, even if the people they work with are drops, as well. Emily's man, Gordon (Percy Marmont) brings around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which suggests being filled by Emily. Fred's "princess" girl (Betty Amann) has the eyes of Clara Bow and the shadow of Wallace Beery's five. There is also an unpleasant passenger, a disdainful spinster who Hitchcock always presents with a cartoon horn stick. The subtlety was yet to come. <br /> <br /> Everything is turned abruptly, with confused blocks and tense dialogues. Hitchcock looks for one of the first comedies with Fred and his umbrella that is not eliminated, and Kendall seems to aim to laugh while Berry plays for tears. When Fred and Emily break away, they are seen being jostled on a pair of rickshaws stuck together, one of the many clumsy symbolism attempts. <br /> <br /> Emily is the only vaguely sympathetic character, partly because she really cares about her husband and torments her relationship with Gordon, but above all because she is among Hitchcock's first magnetic blondes, her platinum curls that lash her face like a Botticelli aboard the deck of a Chinese garbage near the end of the film. > <br /> The arguments conclude with a dangerous situation as a set-piece for the protagonists with which to reckon and, presumably, repair their relationship. Only they are not active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing of the ending ends up resonating. <br /> <br /> At least you'll have a nice view of London in the early 1930s, and a chance to see Hitchcock when he was still working for food. "Rich And Strange" is Hitchcock who pays his debts and learns the trade, one for scholars but not for film-goers.
