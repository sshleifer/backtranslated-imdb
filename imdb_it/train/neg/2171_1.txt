This film certainly has one of the strangest themes in history - right there with Ed Wood's passionate cross-dressing defense in "Glen or Glenda?" <br /> <br /> The subject: playing bridge. The Park Avenue set sounds it; the Bohemians play it. The Russians - who speak a lot of "Russian" and have very unconvincing accents when they speak English - play at the restaurant where they work. <br /> <br /> If one is not interested in bridge, one - - even in spite of the great cast - is not likely to be very interested in this bizarre film. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Paul Lukas are fine. (Well - Frank McHugh is an unlikely ghost writer - since Lukas is an unlikely Russian.) But they are all sunk by the fetishistic script.
