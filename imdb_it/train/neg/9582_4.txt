This set of fecal matter adds up so many ridiculous scenarios that in the end is a riot of laughter of absolute hilarity. Too bad because the premise is promising (as often happens with Duhllywood), but in the hands of this writer it spreads across the land. <br /> <br /> Lowe is in prison for having a time for a DUI who killed his lover. We see that he is having nightmares just to know that he feels really bad about it. Then his next cell mate freezes. Or he? Lowe has suspicions but quickly abandons them. His suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. So why did they then set him up to be killed? Ah, this is where this story could become interesting. That's where he falls off the tracks, and once he's off the rails he decides he can get away with insulting the attention of the spectators for the next numb hour. <br /> <br /> ************ **** SPOILERS ************************* *** <br /> <br /> I will not bore you with an endless tale of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplates this ending. Lowe was trapped by the bad guys on a train. They want a ribbon that has, because that ribbon will attack their leader and them. Then 3 policemen arrive on the train, firearms, ready to save Lowe. The bad guys kill the cops in front of half the passengers and then ... they continue to chase Lowe to get the tape. HELLO!!!! killing 3 cops in public will get you into a deep doodo, to hell with the tape. Yet outside they pass through a mall that shoots on the spot, as if the public didn't exist as a witness, and in the end Lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape !!!
