Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His films are donkey and amateur, and not really funny, unless you are 14 years old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He is certainly not famous, as immature fans would like you to believe, harassing people on Wikipedia, or filling voting votes here on IMDb. Certainly it was not profiled by any of the major media, which talks about his "fame" and his creation. <br /> <br /> Benfer has some small skills in limited animation, but he needs to get away from his licentious youth and learn to write really fun material before he is taken seriously as a true entertainer. From this moment on, however, he is just a kid with a camera, and shows.
