I saw this film with the intention of not liking it. I certainly didn't. It is one of those films that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: the music in the whole film in almost every frame, almost no swear, set in a past time, sepia images, pretentious title, NO SEX and an explaining genius all that thinks and concludes in sfx / cgi so that we (the stupid public) understand it. One thing that amused me is the fact that they wrote the WRONG NOBEL PRICE! Instead they call the Nobel price (which takes its name from a person called Alfred Nobel) "the noble price" ... Jesus! How can such a mistake be made in such a large production, which is supposed to be based on a true story. What a fake! What were you and the others thinking about RON?
