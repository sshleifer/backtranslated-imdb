I think many want to believe that extraordinary things exist and this film shows no limitation in trying to make the most of it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it does not work. Flying blisters filled with hydrogen? They should be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there's the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, but don't try to pass it off as a fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all the film is fun, but I found myself constantly saying "oh brother, what a load of ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch This Is Spinal Tap instead. Or at least mute the sound.
