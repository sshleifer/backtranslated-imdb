The "To Die For" box sucked me in - a shirtless guy and the promise of some laughter and sex. There was a lot of Thomas Arklie (Simon), which is easy on the eyes, but no laughter and little sensuality. <br /> <br /> The couple, Mark and Simon, would have been together for several years, but neither of the two characters is interesting enough to worry about, so it's hard to imagine them taking an interest in each other. The blame seems to be in the script, not in the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they are given. <br /> <br /> The finish is mushy and unaffected (well, not entirely oblivious, I had the relief that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that's fun, "Parting Glances" is far better.
