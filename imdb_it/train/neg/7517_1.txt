*** One in ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it were, you get a F. Holy Mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave everything reasonably, considering it was a video film, but it disappointed me every time. Like so many other B series films, the basic plot was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It is a pity that they have attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco. <br /> <br /> The basic premise surrounds some bags of the confraternity that host their annual collection of funds for Halloween haunted houses, when a book of satanic spells appears from nowhere and throws the boys of the brotherhood into a living hell . Well, this is the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to the visualization of the escapades of these frat boys, abounding in a scandalous lesbian subplot. Very little of the true story is dedicated to Halloween or the mysterious book of spells. In reality it makes me mad that the film producers thought they could do without making such a dribble. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially about frat boy relationships. This is NOT what the film is advertised as. I'm tempted to track down the producers and at least threaten them with physical damage. The acting is as bad as it is bad, it's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny. Cinematography is simply lazy. The whole movie is an amateur evening. This film makes SyFy Channel's productions look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film seemed that the filmmakers realized that they were not producing a soap opera and had to throw themselves into some sort of horror sequences. The evil book of spells finally comes into play and transforms everyone in the house haunted by the character dressed as. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was a disembodied dejected disaster.
