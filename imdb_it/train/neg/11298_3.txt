This is a direct sequel to "The Mummy's Hand" (1940), because the protagonist, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran) is now thirty years older and is telling the story (with the help of archive footage) to her son's boyfriend. There are only two unusual aspects of the film: Banning's untimely death, and Turhan Bey's presence. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney as the Kharis mummy gets the maximum billing, although given the nature of his role, he has little else to do but limp or flail his arms. There is nothing disturbing about his presence, except for his attempt to carry out his fiance, Isobel (Elyse Knox). Dick Foran receives a second invoice, but is killed within the first fifteen minutes! We should wait until "Psycho" (1960) when a main character (Janet Leigh) dies long before the film ends! Banning's friend from the first film, Babe Jenson (now Henson), appears a little later looking a lot, much, older and not doing any of the comic skits he did in the original. It is hard to believe that he is the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting job is wasted because he is killed by Kharis after only two short scenes. He is then left to Banning's son, John (played by the bit player John Hubbard) to lead the cemetery hunt - NO! The sheriff leads a torch that brandishes the crowd at Banning's home to burn it and kill the mummy. Universally familiar sound? <br /> <br /> Turhan Bey is presented to the public as the new High Priest, Mehmet Bey, to take care of and feed Kharis burrow leaves. With its "exotic" voice and appearance, it is a pity that it is killed so easily. A better movie would have had 'Babe' take the charge of Von Helsing kind of things in tracking down the mummy, with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay. But instead we have a pedestrian review of several sets from previous Universal horror films, put together by the hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal's other clunkers, although he also did "Don Winslow of the Navy" (1942) as well as "Don Winslow of the Coast Guard (1943), with Elyse Knox. <br /> <br /> Elyse Knox plays Anne Howe in six films by Joe Palooka (1946-1949) and, of course, Turhan Bey, with 43 films and TV credits, is outstanding in the title role of "The Amazing Dr. X" (1948). <br /> <br /> Cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with many dark shadows in the sheriff's office) that the first movie of mummy "Kharis", but there is little else of interest or excitement. <br /> <br /> I will give him a 3.
