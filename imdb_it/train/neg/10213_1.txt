A lot of people seemed to have enjoyed the movie, so I feel a little bad about giving a bad review. But after seeing him for 96 minutes, I feel I have to do it. Where the hell is this movie's plot ?! I must have lost it, I was waiting for the plot to happen and nothing happened. Of course, the ending was "a bit shocking", but they didn't accumulate. I forgot who was half the time, so they didn't really develop the characters. The acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but I could see it all the time. So ... without giving anything, I have to say that if you don't like actors in the film, there's no real reason to watch this movie. I could be wrong, but I didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the movie. I can't decide which one it would be, so I say judge for yourself. I don't even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and everything ... <br /> <br /> Plot: 0/10 Characters: 1/10 Acting: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 I feel that it's too high really, I stay with my vote at the top.
