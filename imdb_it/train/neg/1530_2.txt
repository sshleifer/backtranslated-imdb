I wanted to record MEN IN WHITE to be able to see it again <br /> <br /> "What? Do you mean that you liked Theo very much?" <br /> <br /> No, I mean, I could watch it again to see if it was delayed, stupid and embarrassingly funny how I can remember <br /> <br /> Many people have claimed that it was created for children. Can I suggest that it was also done by children? because the entire structure of the script is devoid of any kind of discipline by the producers and writers and many pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time <br /> <br /> The cast did not help but I started sincerely to feel sorry for them. Honestly it can be believed that during the shoot the cast had to lie to their families who were filming a hard core porn movie as their embarrassment at having to appear in something so depressing. To give you an idea of ​​how bad acting is every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappears from the narration I waited patiently for her to reappear, and a few seconds later I forgot she was in the movie. I got it ? A BAYWATCH star appears and a few seconds later you forget you are in the movie. This tells you all you need to know about the MEN IN WHITE standard <br /> <br /> fair enough to try to be a live cartoon like THE GOODIES (although THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie) , although perhaps the film deserves some credit for never going down to humor in the toilets, but considering that this is a film for children (this has not prevented ITV from broadcasting it at 11.00 pm) so it should not be near us anyway to the humor of the knuckles
