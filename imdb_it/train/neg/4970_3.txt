Good people, I stumbled upon this movie in the evening while I was evaluating the documents. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the kind of honor it deserves. The Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the least offensive I've ever seen and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This version of Sci-Fi is in the version by Christopher Lambert. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What didn't I like? CGI for one. Surprisingly bad. Even more important is the loyalty to the plot, not to mention the rigged acting. I'm used to both with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Delighted Regardless, Peter
