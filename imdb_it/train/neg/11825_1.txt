This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the film shown on IMDb give recognition to the original author but I did it I don't see it at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end says "suggested by the book Silas Marner" . Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rejection of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> An abused and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and alone, stole all his money. One night a child wanders towards his door while his mother lies dying in the snow outside. The man welcomes her and takes her until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) asks to adopt the child. It is he who generated the son during an illicit affair years before. The battle then follows who must have legal custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this and in every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. Only one can find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have put Mr Martin's acting skills to the test. Plus he has his hair dyed in a carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually make him look more like the clown he is)! There is also the addition of nonsensical jokes, that this unusual comedian cannot resist the discussion of history that has nothing to do and only to diminish the depth of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring that he can be happy only with the man who generated her in all these years. This is conveyed in the film by the girl who applies the nasal decongestant to her nose to make her cry! <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the legality and integrity within the film industry makes it possible to make such a film. If I were a George Eliot trustee, I would insist on reparation. If I were Steve Martin, I'd send the profits to that property or to the poor. At the very least it should be titled Silas Marner - adapted from S Martin. Or better yet removed from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope it is - resign completely and look at Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980s.
