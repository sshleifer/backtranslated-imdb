Times are hard for Angel Town, gangs dominate with an iron fist and for mostly unknown reasons (mainly due to embarrassing screenplays) the gangs want a street kid, Martine joins the gangs, so they beat him every day . However, thanks to the presence of an Olympic kick-boxer (Olivier "The weakest actor in the world" Gruner) named Jacques, hope is coming. Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept messaging films ever made (and I saw my part). It seems to consist in the idea that all gang-infested neighborhoods need, they are French kick-boxers who can't act. Worst of all, there are so many embarrassing moments that it's really hilarious. The best thing comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is. To Wit: "Do you like fighting? (Olivier grabs his best Asian friend in a grate) I could kill him right? When I want him dead he dies! The reason I don't want him dead is because I'm afraid of him, and I know if I'll kill him. His son and my wife will kill me, that's why he doesn't die! "<br /> <br /> Obviously the fact that it's wrong to kill someone, not to mention your best friend is obviously excluded from the equation. Strange. <br /> <br /> However, don't let me make this sound that I hated this movie, far from it, it's so terrible that it's priceless. The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous ending that sees Grunner go one on one with members of the band that (the biggest logical gap in the film) reject the use of guns. Even a handicapped Vietnam veteran helps shoot the gang with his machine gun, while Gruner kicks the boxes for the rest. All this is accompanied by horrible "Mexican" accents and surreal energy that make this film memorable for film buffs like this. <br /> <br /> The other gem of this film is that for some reason Olivier Gruner doesn't go to college despite this being the main reason he is here in the US and not in France to have it with his girlfriend ( In a graveyard in the awkward beginning of the movie) Angel Town is undoubtedly a failure on all imaginable levels but if you laugh at moral martial arts movies with crazy action levels that don't make sense at any level, this is the perfect movie for you. On the other hand, make sure you take a tour of tequila, like the laughable details of the opening song "There is no mercy in Angel Town" <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
