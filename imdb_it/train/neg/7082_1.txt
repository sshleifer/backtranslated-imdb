Ok, I wrote a biting review b / c the movie is horrible. While waiting for another review (for Derrida) to appear, I decided to take a look at the old reviews of this terrible movie. Look at all the positive reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors who have not rated any other film besides this one. Crimminy! and wait until the review of the "rosebud" [sic]. <br /> <br /> Discover the other films examined with rosebuds and have received excellent advice. Oh, shoot !, they happened to the only other films of the two writers and directors. Holy Window-Wipers Batman. <br /> <br /> Joe, Tony, you suck as a writer, and tony, you can't get out of a bad script. No work for you! <br /> <br /> ALWAYS CHECK POSITIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW FILM!
