Many moons ago when I was seven, I vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It attracted my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults they are, they told me "Absolutely not! It's a pile of garbage". Of course, I was very disappointed that I wouldn't be the first guy in my block to see "Incredible Melting Man". <br /> <br /> Little time passed - maybe a couple of days. I forgot "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment is gone. Twenty-five years went by until he came back to the forefront of my thoughts. While browsing through digital cable channels, I found this long-lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was moved and I decided to finally take part in this fruit forbidden by my parents. I should have listened to them. The "Incredible Melting Man" is perhaps the worst film known to man. Makes films like "Def-Con 4", "Metalstorm" and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar nominees, I feel violated for having wasted almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth. effects were raw even for 1977. As someone convinced a film company to produce this film beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. Listen to your parents if they forbid you from watching this movie. They were right.
