No mistake, this is neither a horror film nor a movie. I strongly advise against watching this 82-minute failure; the only reason he deserved a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a glimmer of a turn, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no. <br /> <br /> Characters move erratically in their actions and yet wear Time to develop - thanks to thrifty editors and frankly embarrassed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful state (take on the teen rock style ). The only thing that could have worsened would have been the addition of the perishable ethnic "companion". <br /> <br /> Their encounters with obstacles (whether human or physical) are brief, confusing and completely useless. > <br /> Chris Pine fights to stay above the surface while he is drowned by suffering from a light caliber. Lou Taylor Pucci could not have been drier if he had spent the summer with Keanu Reaves fighting the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> Watch "The Road", look "28 days later", watch TV by day ... anything but this; I beg you. You suffer from boredom, unlike the fact that you could be led to believe in the film, this film is not a cure.
