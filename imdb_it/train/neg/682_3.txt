Note: I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also an audio version of this same film. I saw the audio version and it was aesthetically yicky. Considering that some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without lousy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Rene Clair has a good reputation as a director and Louise Brooks also has a little cult following, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood had already practically switched to audio mode around 1929, from the early years until almost the mid-1930s, many famous French films were essentially silent films - with some dialogues and sound effects crushed over the film. The movements of the lips in many, and in particular in this film, do not even come close to the combination with what is being said and this would explain why an American like Mrs. Brooks could make a French film. This is simply sloppy and I would have preferred them to have just made a silent film - and as a silent film it would have been a medium film - with excellent shooting work (sometimes) and a decent silent style acting. <br /> <br /> The problem that I encountered even with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a game of silent morality around 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit rogue (meaning "old" - not "bitch"). A woman wins a beauty contest and her macho boyfriend can't handle it. Give it all for a while, temporarily, but it's drawn back to the fantasy life and this marks its end! A little melodramatic, eh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> Finally, the character of the friend of the boyfriend (?) I found it very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the film being abused and teased by his friend and everyone else. While he took it throughout the film and no resolution came, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received was petty. Should the audience have laughed while being abused? This seems implicit to me and I don't like it at all. <br /> <br /> There are the best French films of the time (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain and others) as well as the best silent films. I really can't understand the high rating of this film.
