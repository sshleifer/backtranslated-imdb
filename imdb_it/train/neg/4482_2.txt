A perfect little atrocity ... I doubt a single shot lasted longer than the Reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. Painful casting, worse than Kusminsky's version (a reminder: he succeeded in breaking down Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey, the rich got what they deserved. Heathcliff dark and brooding reduced to the status of golden angel, fragile and angellesco, Catherine presented as a plump, a half-breed with a melon breast, mild and weak Linton is a voyeur, and the innocent Isabel becomes the character of Sara Michelle- Gellar from Cruel Intentions. Eddie Bauer, 15, and Abercrombie and Fitch donners, take note. This thing was made for you. It's a music video an hour and a half long in which everything is given to you; you are saved from the inconvenient necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but also from the initial shock of their actions. The actors tried, but, as I said before, they were wronged. Decent photography, but editing is at the level of the television production class in high school. I beg you all: read the book, or even the cliffnotes; look at previous versions of it, including Kusminsky's; but stay away from the many future replicas, during which you will not receive the benefit of the premiere without advertising.
