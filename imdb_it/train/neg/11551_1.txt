Seriously, there's absolutely nothing good about this shitty party. Randolph Scott, a homosexual who has lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years, is in his place more in wood and boring. At 57, he was clearly too old for these romantic roles, although it doesn't matter that much because Gail Russell looks much older than her 31 and is so ugly because of her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking. Lee Marvin plays his usual evil role, but it is not enough to save this garbage. Thank God they don't do westerns anymore, they are just old, old racist movies that enchant guns and murders. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
