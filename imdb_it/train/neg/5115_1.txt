This was supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 and a football fan. I expected to see a football movie. After about 10 minutes, I started wondering exactly how such a bad movie (especially acting) could have entered a theater. About halfway, I whispered to my husband that it was horrible and he explained the facts behind the movie. Even though I was a little offended (and I can see how someone could be VERY offended if he wasn't a Christian) to be preached in a cinema, it wasn't a big deal. It was, however, a big problem to be subject to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, to the quality of the acting. It is a film appropriate for a church trip, but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. I go to the church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I present a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
