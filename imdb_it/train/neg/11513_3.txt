* May contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I leaned back to be honest with this movie. I knew she was reciting Madonna. I knew it would last a whole week in theaters. I knew he had many negative reviews. I did not expect a thorough and thoughtful examination of class, culture and sexuality as we got in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Madonna plays a rich, pretentious and pungent Gorgon who goes on vacation with her tormented husband and brazen friends (the dark woman is as bad as Madonna, exhibiting some really stupid facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the first officer of the ship that the character of Madonna enjoys humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is he such a bitch for him? Simply because the plot requires it so that later, when the two of them are abandoned on a deserted Mediterranean island, the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson. Equally inexplicable is the way they fall in love despite having nothing in common and abusing each other for two-thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> "Swept Away" is a silly, simplistic, superficial film from beginning to end. Madonna gives a typically wooden performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances atrociously for Giannini's request, a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes in which she slaps her and kicks her ass. Guy Ritchie does his "elegant" editing which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in an important film over several years. The finish is mushy and implausible. Basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the nudity of the first and the latter's sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the ego of Madonna is so great that she insists on continuing to prove herself a competent actress. Please let it go, Madge, for our sake like yours. This is not his worst movie. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She hasn't done anything worse than that ... yet.
