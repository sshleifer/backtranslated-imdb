Not to be confused with "Alligator" (1980) by Lewis Teague, which is actually an excellent film, this "The River of the Great Cayman" painstakingly concludes the exotic trilogy of Sergio Martino realized towards the end of the seventies (including the "L "rather watchable Island of fish men" and the not too good "Mountain of the cannibal god"). Tracing the plot of "Jaws" shockingly, the script fails to create any suspense as ever. The creature is ridiculous and its victims "They are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's melody misrepresents the adventures of these foolish tourists presented from the beginning as the obvious elements of the reptile's meal. Nothing to do, rather laughter! And we might find this pitiful rather amusing film if the dialogues and the natives' appearance was not so clearly inspired by pure racism, and very soon the giggling stops in favor of an acid sensation that bears witness to such an attitude condescending. We could excuse bad films and shoddy FX, but not that kind of mentality. Never!
