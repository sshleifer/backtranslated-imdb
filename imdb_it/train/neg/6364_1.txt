Absolute garbage, worst fight scenes of a twenty year old American dandy or ninja movie etc. <br /> <br /> The truly terrible acting, not a capacity in view of the whole film is like a cast of wood sculptures. <Br /> <br /> Just look at how ugly this movie is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, I don't have much love for this movie because it wasn't born in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fight movies, check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are the real martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> laugh and watch this today you may see the unintentional humor of how sad it is.
