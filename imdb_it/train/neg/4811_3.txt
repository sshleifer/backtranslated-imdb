I saw the Canadian videotape of this film as "The Witching" that somehow made its way into the state of New York. The audio was pretty bad, I had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and often the soundtrack was overwhelming the dialogue. Orson Welles was an idiot, worse than usual, and some of his dialogues and others were crossed by an echo chamber. A ghostly figure that continues to reappear has its distorted voice. Some subtitles would have really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of witches or Satanists (the credits say that the group did not intend to represent any real group!) They have a ritual in which they strip and cause an abortion by stabbing a doll. The woman who had the abortion and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith", where he was offered a job in a toy factory. Although one of the AKAs of this film is apparently "The Toy Factory", we never see it, and it is only occasionally indicated to everyone. <br /> <br /> On the way to Lilith, her husband becomes impatient with some of his questions about what his new boss, Mr. Cato, wanted to know about their religious persuasion. He drives aggressively and causes another car to come off the road and explode. After the police arrived, he took a doll that fell from the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the film. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mr. Cato and all citizens are witches, and that they are the ones who caused his miscarriage, even if she doesn't realize it. They want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was unaware. <br /> <br /> Some images in the film have a certain impact, but overall the film is not very engaging. The film seems a bit confused, and this is undoubtedly largely due to its modification and the addition of new videos. The original version, according to the credits, was called Necromancy - A Life for a Life. The magic of the DVD could make us see both versions on a disc, but re-launching this film is probably not a priority.
