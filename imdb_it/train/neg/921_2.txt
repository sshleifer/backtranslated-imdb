I rented it to see Vanesa Talor once more. You can act, but you have no chance in this clunker. The opening sequence is an elaborate crane stroke of mountain landscapes. It must come from a stock archive, because the film is shot directly on the videotape. Production values ​​make _Blair Witch_ a professional aspect. There is a really poor animated statue, but no other noteworthy effect. This film is bad, but not so funny. Players would do well not to mention it on their resumes.
