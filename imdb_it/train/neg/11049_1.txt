If Mr Cranky had evaluated this, I would be tempted to just copy his review and paste it here. But as it is not, I will have to try it myself. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall's acting is excellent. However, not even he can save this film from disaster. The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this because it's just a set of scenes that have been put together with very little continuity, reminiscent of the bad movies of the 70s. Worse, both the actors and the director seemed to have invented themselves as they went along, which probably showed how bad the original script was. <br /> <br /> It is not even worth discussing the plot, even if it revolves around a futuristic the corporation called the Proxate Corporation which brought together a crew of dispensable people to transport a dangerous cargo on an old container ship / slave in Nigeria. This ship's computer is a child kept in a glass jar and connected to one of the crew members via USB 12 or something. The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of this film is on par with an exam of the same name. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't find a scene that I could say was well done and made really sensible in the context of the film. I saw it until the end because I had a touch of bird flu and this film reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse than me - Malcolm McDowall in particular. I will not hold this against him because he is a great actor and every great actor is entitled to a bad movie in their career and this is a doosie. <br /> <br /> So, unless this is the only movie you rent or you are male and you are a doctor you are not doing prostate exams this week and somehow you feel this is a bad thing , then give this to a very large one, unless, of course, if you're really community oriented, buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a coaster.
