I went to this movie thinking it would be the next Clerks, but I felt disappointed. The humor was weak and the characters fairly flat. This does not mean that it was all bad, the idea of ​​the service of appointments in the shop seemed a rather fertile material, but the director focused on the cliché "save the Mom-and-Pop store from the evil kind society". I felt like I would just be stuck with the plot of the dating service, it would come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do the film justice, I'm from the Rochester area and I really liked the way he played Webster. In fact, the best tribute from Kevin Smith (of the Clerks) here was giving props to his hometown. Webster, NY is to verify what Red Bank, NJ is for Clerks. The director has wisely arranged an appointment with Nick Tahou. Trust me, with regards to things to do in Rochester, a garbage platter is at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this movie at Little in Rochester, so everyone knew when the hatreds of the city approached and appreciated them.
