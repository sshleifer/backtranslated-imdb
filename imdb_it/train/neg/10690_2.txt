I guess it's possible he saw worse movies, but this is a real stinker! the plot is insignificant but not the worst thing. the director is not close to what you would expect from andy ching. is capable of a good job but failed to put this film together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harmon, playing the female lead as a reporter who chases who is behind the assassination of the president, has really slaughtered the role. there was no chemistry with gooding, his demeanor was flat and wooden, and the 5-inch stiletto heels he wore during the film were absurd. this harmonic output places it firmly at the bottom of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> and what was cuba gooding thinking ??? has a number of outstanding performances to his credit, but this was far below what is expected of him. <br /> <br /> poor james woods and burt reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor people.
