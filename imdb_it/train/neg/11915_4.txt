This obvious pilot for an unedited television series sees young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnese with some incredible powers that must be used when a demon-demon demon is left free on the world. CGI is the par for a TV job, and Appleby is OK as an amnesia, but hard to swallow as a superhero. The face of family TV Richard Burgi is out and about as an Appleby mentor, but he can't do anything to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level. We see too much the flying demon of cartoons from the beginning, a bad sign. Furthermore, the scenes in which Burgi is training Appleby for the battle are actually ridiculous. I am a bad copy of similar scenes in many other films, in particular REMO WILLIAMS.
