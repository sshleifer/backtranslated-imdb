This film deserves another negative review. Consider a reviewer who enhances the virtues of the film that include "no sex, violence or blood". Uh, excuse me The movie set-up makes us look like Cody's young companion, with love for life and who has everything to live for is torn to pieces leaving Cody holding his body lifeless and bleeding. And given the nature of the war, we know that Cody saw the horror almost every day. So much for those who watch this film with these pink glasses that the violence that defines the character of Cody is erased from the memory of the spectators. <br /> <br /> Without any family of his own Cody, like John Rambo, he wanders the country on his bicycle making the long journey to the birthplace of the United States in the guise of a place called Nevada City. No mention, no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged merchandise. We know this since his CO practically declares it as he orders Cody to "rest" from the death and destruction of the war. This explains, since nobody seems to notice or worry, the obvious "flat" effect of Cody. It's not a bad acting. It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. Don't guess here, remember that his CO ordered him to leave the battlefield. <br /> <br /> How about that "accidental" kiss as noted by another review. Autumn was an accident, the kiss was not. How exactly did Cody "respect" the faith by hitting on her knowing full well that she had been told? This was a moment of unfamiliar value. A moment that is then announced to the immediate universe as if it were published on YouTube. Of course the faith of faith and the "coming" of Cody to a woman who plans to marry another person is welcomed in the spirit of the Christmas season, all rejoicing in their hearts and their lips. <br /> <br /> Little does he know Faith's boyfriend, apart from the fact that she professes his love for him, that he does not accept more than a second nano to accept his proposal (he may have waited some afterthoughts), generous, he loves her to the death, the family has nothing Really against him, he believes that marriage is based on compromises and that the two have never discussed post-marriage plans. No evil here. <br /> <br /> Asner is a good actor given on dialogue in the hills as "we love you son ...." "Be part of our family" literally a few days after meeting a stranger named Cody. And the "band of brothers" speech in which the sentence was never intended above all for virtual strangers outside the battlefield. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: this film is candy floss. Christmas fluff that betrays itself in important ways. Especially when Cody applauds Faith's lack of respect by physically hitting her knowing full well that she spoke. Redefining the family as we know it: accepting a virtual stranger as a true affectionate member of the family because we all love you. How many of you have done it or know someone who did it. NOT.
