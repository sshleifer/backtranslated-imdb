I was glad to see this movie for free while working in the hotel industry and this film has recently arrived in our movie library. Nothing against low-budget films, but this film has horrible acting and directing. How can a film like this ever be made? The director should be blacklisted, and for all poor actors, it is certainly not a leap in a career. Please make sure you don't watch this movie, the acting is lame, the camera and the guide terrible. There are only a couple of movies out there that deserve to be called "LOW 10". Another example could be "Dracula 3000". People who make money with this film should give it to charity, so at least it's for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case I would also look at another 10 (or at least another time).
