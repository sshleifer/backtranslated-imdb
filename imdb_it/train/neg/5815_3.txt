I couldn't wait to see this movie based on previews and press it, but after seeing it I was terribly disappointed. Slums is a totally unpleasant film mixed with a kind of disturbing family reality of Todd Solondz, without the mark of Todd's humor. History drags on and every scene is worse than the previous one. Maybe I missed the point, but if this movie is an example of each girl's growth experience, I'm happy to be a man.
