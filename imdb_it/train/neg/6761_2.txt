Let's tell the truth. Like a film school project, made without budgets and "real" actors, this is a passively interesting film. As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it's a poorly produced product. If I had to lazily change channels and happen to accidentally capture this movie, I would probably stop my eyes and my attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD with the impression that I would get an appropriate film product, a film, I feel deeply disappointed. It is a television game with video recording, something on the line of old magazines of the sixties, but without that certain charm. Apart from the protagonist Mr Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either campus chap (a bit too old for that in reality), or members of the director's family, who appear in front of the camera without help only from the acting sofas, but also from the make-up artist or hairdresser (a cap over the long-grown bangs or a top hat over the mullet is very far from the creation of the 40s). It's all shot with a camera mounted motionless in a small, bare studio, sometimes using the blue screen for external backgrounds. Synthesizer generated uninspired score of "lame" period inspired by romantic karaoke insults the ears of spectators on more than one occasion. The film tries to be "dreamlike", while in reality it is only a collage without conceptions of those shots that have arrived at editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to start). There are interesting dialogues from time to time, but overall it is a rather lame and two-dimensional production in more than one way, without flashes of genius from either the director or any crew member. That's how "artistic" films tried to appear in the 1980s. Mr. Redfield has a much better job as an actor than the director.
