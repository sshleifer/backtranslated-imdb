I discovered this film on IFC and thought it would be interesting. For "little" love stories, some of the stories dragged into this film. The fact that none of these women has a name almost makes one suspect that the actresses were talking about their own sexual lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to start seeing again some more romantic visions of the first sexual encounters, as in "Strike! (1998)", when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her supposed first time, and Tweety asked was it nice? "<br /> <br /> Some might think that re-enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think it would make things even worse. It doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I expected more.
