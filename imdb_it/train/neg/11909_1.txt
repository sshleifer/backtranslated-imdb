I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film - Lilith was Adam's first wife and was considered imperfect and banned from the Garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam and refused to submit to him. See, I took those words directly from the script. Then the film continues and even though she is the heroine of the film, the only time it becomes acceptable is when she does what men tell her to do! Finish the film under the control of The Faith - an all-male group! <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the script was predictable and the FX was horrible. Apart from the obvious hatred for women that is usually much more subtle in modern movies, there was nothing original about Darklight.
