Ohhh brutality, ohhhhh the dying race, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the injury! Man, when will all the lamenting revisionists stop analyzing the westerns for shouting loudly? S ** t happens. If it offends your socially designed sensibilities, return to the comfort of your Meryl Steep collection. <br /> <br /> Boring, boring and very tiring drain of celluloid, in particular in light of the presence of Coburn / Hackman / Bergen. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you're obsessed with the 19th century dentist. It may have been a little better without the constant diversion of the Mexican out of place with bad teeth. A monument to the stupid creeping ultra-left sensibility of the 60s and 70s. Practically impossible to sit through the entire film. I think I'd rather have your eyes poked for the entire Lucky Luke / Trinity series. 4 Horses / 10-all dead hell.
