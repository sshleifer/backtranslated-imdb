Get an idea. Personally, I found it as much fun as getting a spinal cord from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Maybe it's a comedy, but I found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices for babysitting your children; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two energy drink vendors, are ordered to court two children from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) to avoid jail time. One of the misfits is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fifth grader with a dark mouth and the other is Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a shy young man who plays in a medieval fantasy world. Wheeler and Danny are desperate to give their charges a priceless view of life, love and heavy metals. Lynch is hilarious with his witty analogies. The supports are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.
