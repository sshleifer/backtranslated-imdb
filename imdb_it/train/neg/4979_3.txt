Why, oh, why can't anyone make a decent movie with a legendary story? This is the second adaptation of "Beowulf" I have been disappointed for a year. But I must say that the previous version ("Beowulf & Grendel", with Gerald Butler) was far superior to this. That was just a little disappointing. This is a mess !!! <br /> <br /> What bothered me the most? Were the elements of the plot useless to which they added without particular reasons (human sacrifices? Love interest without points?), Or the bad CGI, or the inconsistency of the characters or the uninspired acting? Even worse was the way they made the beautiful Sirtis Marina so horrible !!! And don't we even talk about that ridiculous crossbow? <br /> <br /> And because they constantly reminded us that Beowulf had the strength of 30 men, yet he never showed the least sign of strength in the whole film. He was tossed around by both of the monsters he fought, relying on his helpers to save his bacon. Even when he hit the arrogant prince, he didn't knock him out. He was too dependent on weapons. Beo-wimp is more like him. This was certainly not the mighty Beowulf of the epic! <br /> <br /> I would like to end this on a positive note, but I can't really think of a hand in hand. All I can say is, if you've ever read "Beowulf", you'll be infinitely disappointed by this sad and inaccurate excuse for an adaptation!
