Ok, I saw this movie for the first time at 9:00 am at Cinemax a few weeks ago and I thought it would be rewarded, boy was I on 180d. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the mother of monsters shows her true form only at the end of the film. I'm going "Here, because he doesn't show it a little earlier in the film". The plot being the mother and the child feast on the blood of young women. It would not be better if they continued, you know, a murderous madness by killing each other like a pair of young women, then letting the sheriff or policeman discover and getting in the old discovery a way to kill monsters, save the young woman / woman and have 1 or 2 people killed in the process? I think it would be much better this way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and is killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Also, how does this force end up killing people at the end of the film? He said that she herself was too weak. What the hell didn't work with Stephen this time? After all, I can never, ever act in any film of any actor, do their best. If it wasn't for good acting, I would have given this movie a 1/10. 3/10.
