I read the book Celestine Prophecy and couldn't wait to see the film. Keep in mind that the film is freely based on the book. Many of the most interesting points of the book do not even come in the film. It's a "B" movie at best. Many events, characters, how the character interacts and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur. The flow of events that are very fluid in the book, are moved and fueled by sight as if I were a child. The character development is very poor. The personal characteristics of the characters differ from those of the book. The direction is similar to a horror film "B". I understand that it would take six hours in the movie to present everything in the book, but many points are missing on the game screen. The casting was very good.
