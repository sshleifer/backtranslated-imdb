I don't think some people really like this. Yet they are still called Batman fans. Even going as far as to say that it is better than BTAS. Which is not. It should be a plagiarism for them to use the name Batman for this piece of shit. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is "if you can't defeat someone, take a bigger weapon to help you". Batman does not only deal with weapons. Use his batarang and grapnel and Batmobile, that's all. He doesn't come up with a new ingenious technology every time he can't beat anyone. I don't know where the hell they got the idea of ​​a Batbot. or anything else. They ruined all the bad guys. Mr. Freeze switched from a sympathetic scientist to a small criminal who fell into a frozen thing. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman in a stupid costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot tall hat. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, making the Dummy the whole fulcrum of the character. They even had a stupid idea of ​​making it a giant! WTF? and the two worst changes of character are those of The Joker and Riddler. they changed Riddler into a gothic / retro maniac. and The Joker to an acrobat with dreadlocks. He looks like Bob's marley aspirant. they have completely and completely ruined Batman even more than done by B & R! I wish I could meet the creators and / or writers and animators of this show so that I can hit them over the head with a metal baseball bat.
