I'm not a big fan of horror movies and I've only seen a handful (and none of "Halloween" or "Friday the Thirteenth") - but I can appreciate a scary horror movie not because of the gore. And I'm pretty sure it's not scary. <br /> <br /> What's so spooky in a small plastic skull that opens up everywhere? In all his appearances there are distant shots, so there is no real surprise in any of these films. (Not that a skull in itself is so scary, but ...) The plot concerns the third cousin of Claus Von Bulow (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-canna look (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances always) that begins to see skulls and listen to the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on the villa of her husband. Did I mention that your husband lost his first wife in a mysterious drowning accident? OOOOH !!!! I ask who did it !!!! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot of a rich boy trying to kill and / or drive his wife crazy. If you want to see a well made version of this stuff, try "Reversal of Fortune". And by the way, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MSTing was ok but nothing special; combined with the short "Gumby", however, is a great vision. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now, to paraphrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
