I'm afraid I didn't really like this movie. Apart from a few thanks, there is nothing to write about at home. <br /> <br /> J-horror has exploded over the past five to six years but the films themselves have had more of a repetitive account and carbon copies of a previous success. This is one of these. <br /> <br /> Basically this is a supernatural slasher film. The beginning is promising with the chilling scenes of a morgue where a dead girl has her eyes sewn graphically, but immediately afterwards she opens them. However, after this, it's quickly downhill for this movie. <br /> <br /> To be nice I'll start with the things I like about "Gawi". On the plus side, the images are garish and the film looks perfect for its type. For those who like their horror movies, there are some well executed murder scenes (no pun). We also have some good suspense sequences / set-pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are also some drawbacks ... <br /> <br /> First of all, and my biggest complaint about this film, is that the plot skips and jumps back and forth in the time with an alarming intensity. It's usually not a problem for me, but here, where the students look exactly the same regardless of age, I've been confused on more than one occasion. <br /> <br /> The representations are okay I think (a little hard to say when you don't know the language), but it seems a little stiff. And for a horror movie, I don't think it's scary enough. For a while I was pretty bored. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of yellow movies, I was expecting a lot from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.
