In this film three stories were told, which seemed to have been shot without a combined movie. The producers relate the three cartoons by connecting them all to Martin Kove, even if you never see the leads with Kove. <br /> <br /> The first cartoon has the sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman who is afraid of everything in the sun (makes Adrian Monk look brave), having a paranoia evening at home alone. You will literally cry to Vivian for doing ridiculous things. He spends most of his time in a nighty showing his amazing features. But his film is the worst, if not the most pungent. <br /> <br /> The second cartoon is owned by Bill Paxton while he portrays his roommate from hell. His brilliant roommate allows him to take full advantage of him, and Bill does it whenever he can. <br /> <br /> The last cartoon was funny how a man fears that death will take him at any moment, just like his friend who suffocated to death on an olive. <br /> <br /> Not very interesting, as the film as a whole seems to be broken up together with very little thought involved. A must for Bill Paxton fans.
