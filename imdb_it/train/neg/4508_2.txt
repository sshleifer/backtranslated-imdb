Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this right now, and I find this scary movie. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They are doing all this for a man!?" <br /> <br /> I find that these women have no intensity, no sense of a struggle between tragedy and identity, and that for these men it is not worth fighting. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi conquers them, men seem more stupid than admired. <br /> <br /> The Japanese have much more intensity than the Chinese and the geisha is the Japanese culture. I'm sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces don't match the main one. <br /> <br /> However, the dialogue is so mysterious, so American. If a European had done it with Eastern Europeans, he would have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> I have to add: it seems that most of the people who liked the film are Americans. I'm sorry to say, but it's no wonder. All written for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think Chinese actresses are adorable, but I couldn't say they were good actors in this movie. Yes, cinematography is fantastic, but in reality I don't see how one can see that these characters are complex and deep individuals. I go to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be great to see.
