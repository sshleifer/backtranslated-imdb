This is exactly why many people remain homeless. . . because stupid producers pay their money to make horrible films like this instead of donating if they can bother us! <br /> <br /> This film is even worse than the whites! Little Man has a bad excuse to pose a character as a child as a child. The story is terrible considering it was written by six people. The idea, however, would not be so bad if it was original and not a rip off of a cartoon episode. it has funny moments, but some of them are excessive and some are just stupid. The acting was very, very bad. Thus was the direction. Anyone involved in this film should be ashamed of himself. he is racist and very offensive to the dwarves. I mean, instead of showing sympathy for them, the filmmakers make fun of them! It really disgusts me how they do it. They see the dwarves being just like children. And for a character who is a dwarf, pretending to be an abandoned child just to get a diamond from a certain family. This is his uncomfortable excuse to show something like that. It really wasn't worth it. Don't watch this movie. It's a huge waste of time and money.
