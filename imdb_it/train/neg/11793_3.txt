Deep Shock acts like a TV movie: a cast of commercial quality actors, a badly designed creature to be the "bad guy", and a screenplay that is more full of technical and political jargon than I know what to do with. <br /> <br /> I checked the film because of the creature (I like to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these inexpensive videos), and immediately afterwards I was disappointed because the creature on the box didn't it was that of the film. The actors that I expected because of the type of film is (really rather generic and not thought beyond a certain point). The music was symphonic action typical music, not thought out. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment, along with the mini-sub design. The film ran really well, with guide screens that let you know in which series you are looking at the story. But there is not much of a story here. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 3/10 IMO star. The boring search and destroys the mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures that protect it ... a little lame. Even lamer is the love relationship tagged between two characters that you don't see coming. Chalk this up to be a movie that tries to get the careers of the actors off the bench and into a video. Do not worry
