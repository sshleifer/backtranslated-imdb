So ... we get Brando's added video ... interesting but not exactly worthy of the Oscars. Susannah York was not nearly a crack. The new scene in which Lois discovers that Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable as he does not notice that there are empty spaces coming out of the gun instead of the real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then would have bounced off the floor, but let's forget ... we hear Donner making fun of Lester's version which makes more sense. The president talks about the Zod "disfiguring" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Modifying that scene made this line quite absurd. Superman's "freedom of the press" line seemed foolish compared to "How to get out" which was delivered better and had an adequate connection to Clark's previous scene in the truck standstill. Then there is the ending with the "go back in time to go back in time" effect. He returned everything to the whole movie and made you ask where exactly the rocket aimed at Hackensack, N.J. He never went since he didn't release Zod and the company anymore.
