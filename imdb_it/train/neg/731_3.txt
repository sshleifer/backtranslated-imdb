Mike Hawthorne (Gordon Currie) is witness to his mother's brutal murder and his father Morty's suicide (Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends in his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where guests confess and face their worst fears ... Mike tries to evoke the spirit of his late father. It soon turns out that the spirit of Morty lives in a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the bloodbath begins. <br /> <br /> Most F / Xs are not very convincing and the film takes on an economic theme for teenagers. Stale history acted pitifully. The cast members are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran Betsy Palmer.
