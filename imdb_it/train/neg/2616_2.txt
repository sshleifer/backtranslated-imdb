Remember Kevin Lime's name - and please, please don't leave it direct back to <br /> <br />. Timing, rhythm, editing: all hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, leave the ensemble <br /> <br />) can do nothing to save this movie from amateurs like Alice <br /> < br /> Evans and the kind of production standards you would expect from <br /> <br /> children's shows produced by teenagers on British TV. <br /> <br /> mystery: music. A score so inept, inappropriate and <br /> <br /> ill-adapted to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is <br /> <br /> a case of sabotage. Add an audio that apparently explodes <br /> <br /> un-engineered by a single microphone, and a director who only intermittently remembers adding auditory action off the screen, and us <br /> <br /> have what must be the biggest cash ratio for the recent <br /> <br /> result.
