For the life of me I cannot understand the blind clamor and devotion to this absolutely incredible film ...... and I think I have the qualifications to say it ... I am a former soldier of special operations with 14 years in lo " lifestyle "... This film was totally unreal and obviously written by someone who did very little research on life in the army, in combat or at team or platoon level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys bypassing Baghdad alone ????? Get real ... No chain of command ????? Get Real ... EOD that erases buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper buck sergeant qualified ???? Take the Real ... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad boy and then I let two guys take me without firing another shot or injured for nothing ???? Get the Real ... Carjack of an Iraqi civilian, while I am armed only with a 9 mil, break into another civilian house, be punished by his wife and then return to camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night without as much as a scratch or a comparison ???? Get real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no adherence to the military protocol {Army} and no resemblance to any army unit I have ever met. Completely incredible and disrespectful to the men and women of EOD who contrary to this poor film are not wild adrenaline in search of yahoos but highly qualified professionals who do an incredibly difficult job.
