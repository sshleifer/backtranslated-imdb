Considering that this film had a serious and very successful launch campaign, I would have expected it to be worth the lapel ... from the opening scene in which the two brothers "sensually" caress each other, lying down naked on a bed) quickly goes down ... nothing to attract attention, not something that catches the mind in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but the artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script does not analyze either of the two in depth (think that a possible excuse of the producers, saying that they aimed at a thin film would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial means the same thing ...). Too curious onlookers will have no interesting scene ... at this point, it may have saved part of the film ... so you can imagine how ugly it is. Many other things could be said ... but please watch the movie yourself ... I am selfish and I would like as many people as possible to waste about 1 1 / 2h of their lives ... like I did :(
