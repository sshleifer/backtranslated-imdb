I actually saw China O'Brien II before seeing the original China O'Brien. And I must say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = more fun! And more fun = better If you're a bad movie fan like me, this is a great material. If, however, you are looking for any kind of meaningful plot, acting skills or film making skills, it is best to avoid it. The best part is how they filmed all the combat sequences in stuttering forward fast. Hilaryly bad. Watch it for a laugh, watch it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, watch it for free on TV.
