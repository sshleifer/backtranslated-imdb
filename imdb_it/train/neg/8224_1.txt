Are you watching this movie? I thought to myself, what a garbage bag. These girls must have stones for their brains for agreeing to be part of it. I just assumed a waste of time watching him, weak skies. The acting was below standards and the story was unbearable. Anyone who thinks about watching this movie, please save your money. The film has no credit. I'm a real movie buff and this is worse than "Attack of the Green Tomatoes". <br /> <br /> I just hope this piece of junk didn't cost too much. The money would have been better spent on the homeless of the world. I just hope there is no sequel in the pipeline.
