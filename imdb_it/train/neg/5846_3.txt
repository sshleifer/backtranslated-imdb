Yes, this is one of those films, so terrible, so insipid, so banal, that you can't stop laughing. I saw comedies, good comedies and laughed less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea quite good. The characters are so unpleasant that they cheer up the mice, the effects are so scarce that you wonder who the elementary school of art was, acting ... oh the acting ... you talk about tired dialogues and embarrassing pauses. <br /> But the mouse, yes, the big mouse. Because we could not see the mouse until the end rather surprised me. Often the "big" is not shown until the end because the budget is limited and the positive effects chew so much money. I suppose, however, that in this case the big mouse was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a boy who ran dressed as a groundhog with third world dentistry. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole film is the elevator scene. After realizing that the mice could not withstand loud noises (headaches from bad acting?), The main guy installs a fire alarm to kill the rats. If you've ever wanted to see a pair of waltz mice as blood spurts out of your head like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you need to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, OK?
