Entertainment Tonight has gone down the hill in recent years, but since last night (17 August 2006) it has reached a new low. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to try to advertise their broadcast, they decided to publish real photos of JonBenet Ramsey's body in their teasers last night ... saying "Images from the case you never saw before". The two photos were graphic and very disturbing. One was of the side of the face and the head / neck and the cord that was used to strangling her around the neck and bruises on the face was clearly visible. It was so horribly terrible, I couldn't believe it. How did all this have to do with ANY remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ?? Anything!! They lowered their level of dignity and values ​​to a new minimum ... and show. This was the first show to watch ... and it's just rubbish now. <br /> <br /> I will watch Access Hollywood from now on.
