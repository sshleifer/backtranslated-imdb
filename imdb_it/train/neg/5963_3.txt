This film begins with a performance of a witchcraft practitioner and her lover. His head is cut and buried separately from his body ... it sounds like "The Thing that wouldn't die", right? Well, it sounds a bit like that, but once the body has met with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths have been made and the film moves very slowly. I mean the film only lasts 88 minutes and I kept thinking "When will it end"? The characters in the film are idiots for the most part and deserve to die to be really stupid. The bad guy is also very bad because he is slow and you really wonder how he can do anything, since he is afraid of jewels. The only thing that keeps you looking after the head has been reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs that start to lose track. However I want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn movie and like a horror movie, it's a way of slowing down the path with many slow strokes to be a little fun too. And do not read the back of the box as if it were like there were meat eating zombies that attack the city, there is ... only a small scene in which three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily rejected are not by no means a factor in the film and their scene is rather useless. So for the most part I say that you should avoid this movie unless you find it really cheap.
