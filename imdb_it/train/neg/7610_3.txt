In general I don't like films directed by Sydney Pollack ("The Firm" is a bit of an exception) and I've never been a fan of Robert Redford. However, I thought that "Three Days of the Condor" should be good due to the number of appreciative comments it received. <br /> <br /> Although the widescreen cinematography is rather pleasing to the eye and Max von Sydow does a good job as the sinister professional killer, I found the whole thing terribly disappointing. The film unquestionably radiates a paranoid atmosphere, but everything is ruined by the confusing plot that does not seem to make any sense. <br /> <br /> The film also contains one of the most unsatisfactory endings I have ever seen and that really leaves the viewer hanging in the air. And what can be said of that absurd love story between Redford and Dunaway? I'd rather watch Hitchcock movies five times in a row than sit down with this piece of junk again.
