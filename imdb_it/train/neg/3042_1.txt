I am allowed to write 1000 words on this film, but one word could be enough: bizarre. My husband and I didn't laugh so much as a geek at this really terrible movie. We kept looking at each other with our best "What the ...?" expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this film. Killer tomatoes were fun, but this is simply sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film to show them to others? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this strange bizarre film and then packages it as if it were appropriate for children? Parents, whatever you do, if your child still believes in Santa, don't let him see this movie. Pre-adolescents can watch it - probably with "What the ...?" expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others, you may want to increase the price of their eggnog. <br /> <br /> Most likely the worst movie ever made.
