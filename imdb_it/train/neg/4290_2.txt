I will give this film two stars because it is full of beautiful photographs. Otherwise, it is mainly based on clich√©s and stereotypes: the mountaineers are either stupid white waste racially fanatically religious or torn, or white Indian sages. Indians are magical people who move without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals and read minds over great distances. And so on and so on. <br /> <br /> During the film I kept wondering what the point of the film was (besides showing me beautiful photos of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, lively mountain inhabitants and strange people in church). <br /> <br /> The plot touched on a whole series of problems but did not explore anyone in depth. This was neither a growth story during depression, nor an orphan, nor a struggle for identity. He tried to be all this and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Even if the film had to be about Little Tree education, we learn almost nothing about it. He was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who was brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; he tried his hand to cut the wood (which he failed) and the whiskey that flowed (literally); I learned to read (and perhaps write) with the help of my grandmother and her dictionary - and so it was. Apparently he didn't learn much during his time in college because he was locked up in the attic. <br /> <br /> However, the grandmother and the grandfather and the character of Graham Greene made sure that in the end Little Tree became a true spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - later, and I'm paraphrasing here, " riding with the Navajo "and" being involved in a couple of wars "- was" catching up "with grandfather and grandfather and the character of Graham Greene in heaven (instead of saying going out with girls, getting married, having children or other nonsense similar). Last but not least, I must say that I found my grandfather's trade offensive. Why was it still a whiskey? To counter the stereotype of the "drunk" Indian?
