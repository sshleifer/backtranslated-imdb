Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers he tried to be, a parody of the horror genre that tried to be smart by referring to other famous horror movies. Now, I'm not bagging "Scream" because I think "Scream" is a great horror movie that does a great job at combining horror and comedy. The cut fails on most levels. It has its moments but on the whole it does not work, not even as a film "so bad is good", only one below the average. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes are OK and you set the story pretty well, apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act, and ironically pulls out your tongue, go figure out. Go ahead for a while and a group of film students want to finish their film, which is apparently cursed. And, as you probably expected, one by one the cast and crew are slowly discovered by a masked madman. <br /> <br /> The unoriginal plot, mediocre acting and a predictable ending are some of the elements that follow. There is an abundance of references in the film, from "Scream" to "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". Even this is not intelligent, it seems that the director wanted to feel intelligent and funny mentioning other famous horror films like Scream. For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity, which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that doesn't have much to do. Really, I should support this film because I'm Australian and we're not good at horror (but we have our gems, though) but Cut is definitely not one of them. <br /> <br /> However, it kept me looking for about 90 minutes, so at least it's something good. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone other than hardcore slasher fans, who might be able to appreciate what this movie is trying to look like, but if you're looking for a good movie, stay away. <br /> <br /> 2/5
