The only good thing about this year's ceremony was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was quite short, it was still a bit boring. I think it's really time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can invent something REALLY new. It is quite obvious that they have tried to make the show more "trendy" and attractive for a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and letting P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Even letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to renew the ceremony and make it more attractive. None of this worked. <br /> <br /> Of course, Chris Rock is a nice guy, but he was not a good presenter. I saw it simply as a boy who occasionally spoke between the different categories. His presence was not really "big" like that of Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Even the delivery of prizes was sometimes rather stupid. Don't let everyone come on stage, but even handing out some of the prizes right in the middle of the theater was just weird. <br /> <br /> However, I don't remember being more satisfied with the award winners. None of the films has really wiped out the awards like in the last two years. So does that mean it's been a good year for movies with many competitive competitors? I don't think so. I think most movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years, except "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of the Christ". Of course, I don't agree with every single award that was released this year, for example Caleb Deschanel should have won for the best photography, not that I didn't like Robert Richardson's work, he really did an extraordinary job for the Most of Oliver Stone work, but I really feel that Deschanel has earned the much more award. Also I would have liked to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for the best editing and John Debney for the best music. But oh well, there is no way that the Academy Awards can please everyone, of course, I understand it. There will always be people complaining about the winners. <br /> <br /> It was also fun to see that most of the presenters of the award were much more nervous than the candidates and winners. Has Prince ever said any of the names of the candidates at one time? And Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they were wrong" The irons were the best presenters of the evening. <br /> <br /> Overall an unforgettable show, but with some nice winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
