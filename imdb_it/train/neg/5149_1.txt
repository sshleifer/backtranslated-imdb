This film is about a woman who is a rape victim / New York comic writer who decides to escape from that terrible charm of a big city and move into a dirty one, run away to a small town where she finds refuge in a unique trailer on a land lot in the middle of 12 and nowhere. The citizens are mentally ill, yet it is so to invite the madmen to his trailer. Annoying is the fact that you have the ability to do exactly the right thing to put yourself in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance was at its highest in high schools. He is one of those very nice young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately the career was not kind and the mother nature was right in tow. To the previous commentator stating that the acting was "so real", well, I agree. He wasn't actually acting. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no other, rented it for laughter. The real crime scene? The atrocious wooden panel in the trailer - enough to commit murder. And finally, she's an artist / writer, so she couldn't afford a double caravan and anything other than a sunny yellow Chevy Chevette for the love of god!
