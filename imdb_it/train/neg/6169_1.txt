Being a big fan of horror movies, especially J-horror and even gore, I thought that Nekeddo's burdado sounded pretty good. I researched the plot, read the reviews and even looked at some photos to make sure it looked like a good and scary movie to watch before downloading it. So excited that he had finished and ready to be scared and retreat with horror at the incredible gore I expected to be terribly disappointed. The plot was ridiculous and did not even make sense and remained too inexplicable, the gore was hilarious rather than terrifying, and what was it with the cartoon-style sound effects? Acting was probably the only slightly scary thing about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus and the way in which the mother's husband disappeared in the middle of the sea after following a flashing light, they left both unexplained, or perhaps I missed them because my mind could not understand what I really was seeing. I appreciate the way it was meant to be; shocking and some scenes (the strange cannibalism and his own kissing mother?) certainly were, I think they went a bit far and not even terrifyingly, they made it unconvincing that it was more believable to be a comedy than a horror in my opinion. However it is a very funny film and it has caused a lot of laughter from me and a couple of friends, but unfortunately we expected horror and not comedies so it's worth taking a look at the value of entertainment, but don't expect a dark, deeply film scary and terrifying; you will simply be disappointed. If it were a horror comedy / parody I would probably rate it on a nine, the culmination is the strange scene in which her husband climbed into his wife's stomach and closed her wounds, but unfortunately I gave her one horror as a horror.
