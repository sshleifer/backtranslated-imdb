If you hit the head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you could get close to the level of intelligence in this movie. There is nothing in this film that has not been done a thousand times in other gangster films and done much better. Who thinks "Scarface" was a kind of hero to watch or see "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "This is life for me!" will like this movie. I thought of giving the film a chance, since the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs involved. Anyone who passes a fourth grade education, look at the original with Pacino, a real actor, and be satisfied.
