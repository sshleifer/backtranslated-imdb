It's a pretty good cast, but the film is not at all close to the grace of the Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for a fun caper movie should visit the original. William Macy could be one of our greatest living actors, but it doesn't make much sense here. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. You might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and structured but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely useless and the things they take away are lost. Even starting as it seems bizarre for free and takes away the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his bizarre and brilliant charm and Luis Guzman has a strange charisma, but the part of the film's love story seems rather clumsy and flat. It is a pity that nobody understood how to make this film as it was created for the first time, but then it is a pity that we live in a culture in which we feel we have to do incredible things instead of simply learning to taste the originals.
