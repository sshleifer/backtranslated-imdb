I heard so much about this film as it was a great slasher and one of those early 80s die hard fans of most slasher movies, he just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that despite having caught my attention regarding the suspense for most slasher movies like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", this movie could have had reason up there, with the above mentioned, lacked the true enthusiasm and potential of the characters as well as the ongoing story. The characters I found were unlucky in this film was the wacky type with frizzy hair that kept crawling around the dorm and, of course, brought his true climate role to the end with the killer. Another would be the dirty and scruffy guy with the denim jacket, he could have played more roles in this film that could have made the film more interesting, instead, the film played this guy as another loser who makes unknown phone calls while sleeping with his girlfriend and then drops his part and interrupts him until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed on his side at the end. As for the true identity of the killer, when the identity was released on who he was, I simply laughed, but it was all obvious and he really made a real fool of himself as well as a boring character after his true intentions were revealed . This film should be at least one to watch once for all slasher fans, but don't spend your hard-earned money on it in some rare repertoire of hard-to-find repertoires.
