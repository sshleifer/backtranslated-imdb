"White Noise" could have been one of the most talked about films in "The Exorcist", I think. Since the EVP is presumably true, in reality an easy passage was a real dreaded fact. There are not many films that really frighten people's minds. Like I said this movie could have, but it didn't. The film degraded to a low-class PG-13 fear movie. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" by any means. Someone really just needs to take charge of the horror film industry and simply make a movie that not only makes us think, but makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. I'm genuinely fed up with the Horror genre PG-13, because it's becoming a genre in its own right. We need the old days, the days of blood and blood, the days of Freddy Kruger, Jason, Mike Myers. Few movies can make you think of this mentality that is not so scary. So why try to get it out? Some good jumps in this film are nothing but one of the stupidest endings in the history of cinema without any resolution ... don't waste your money on this film.
