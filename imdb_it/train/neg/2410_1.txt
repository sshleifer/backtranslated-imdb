Hood of the Living Dead and all the other films that these guys have directed seem like they are together and have filmed this with their friends who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (the lines are completely incomprehensible and unconvincing). I find that 95% of home movies and 90% of home video movies are better than this film (although the similarities between them deserve comparison). "Hey let's see if anyone is stupid enough to buy our movies!" We hope that no ELSE was not. My apologies to those involved in flic like this review is a bit harsh, but I was the drug that read your fake reviews and bought the movie.
