One wonders why someone would try to rework successful film plots that have already been seen, as in the case of this film. "The Wedding Date" is one of the best examples of why not even try to redo, with the pretext of a new story, something that should have been, not to say. If a project like this goes ahead with the approval of the big Honchos studio, then go ahead with big stars and lucid production values, in this way, people will come for the stars. <br /> <br /> Alas, that's not what happens in this wrong comedy attempt. The problem seems to be the way in which the writers have transplanted the story to London, when in the end, this seems to be a typical American situation that not even the setting will be able to solve. Then there is the problem with the stars. Debra Messing and Dermot Mulrooney? They have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Since Kat and Nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not dragged into the movie the way the creators thought they would be. It is clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and vice versa in this predictable story. Amy Adams, who was the best resource in "Junebug", looks like a superficial girl who is willing to keep her lie and is not cleaned by the man who loves her and will marry her. <br /> <br /> For anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film last for almost seven minutes!
