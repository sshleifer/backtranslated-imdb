So it came to this. Fast and expensive cars that only 1% higher will ever drive. The girls posing next to them in gearbox magazines. Second-level and unnamed actors. Economic promotional aspects of people coming from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the garbage that Hollywood has to offer. Do not get me wrong; I love mindless action movies with hot girls as much as the next guy. But please, the collective Braintrust who will turn on this stuff please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a cordial "Woooooosaaaaaah", then rewind twenty-five and remember what made the movies fun once? So REALLY make movies like that again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, but the entire pop culture explosion that has enjoyed over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother think that their Maverick now (not that half of them will have the reference). Some executives said, "Hey, which demographic do you want to eliminate $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, the market 18-35." "Ok, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Fantastic idea, sir." The result? A movie that I saw hundreds of times in the evening on Spike TV, and most of the time, with Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Now don't get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. Exaggerated art films like The English Patient don't float on my boat, but generic movies that shouldn't even have been transmitted directly to DVDs mocked me. Only teenage gearheads will have their engines in this situation, and I imagine those in the higher end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a landfill.
