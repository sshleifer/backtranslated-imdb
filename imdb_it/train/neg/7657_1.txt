There should be a rule that clearly states that films like Resident Evil should be made in the spirit of the game, not in the spirit of blowing up everything that is possible. RE was a survival horror game, and damn effective, but Paul WS Anderson managed to do it like any other video game film. Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of spirit as Resident Evil, so obviously there is a slight hope that the director will have enough brains to make a horror movie and not an action movie. Alone in the Dark instead shows that there is no more hope that video games will become films. <br /> <br /> The plot, despite the fact that it obviously shouldn't matter, is the biggest of many problems with the film. The film begins with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important, since after a minute passes, the audience stops worrying and simply sits down among others by hitting the nearest object to them. Then there's something about an orphanage, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all so confused that viewers can't follow what's going on. The characters enter and exit the plot like candy, some with huge accumulations of senseless deaths. Basically, what I can understand is that some demons have been released, and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some connection with them thanks to some operations given to the children in his orphanage that failed him. Find an artifact that involves demons and take him to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), who naturally manages to have sex right away without a good reason. Then, out of nowhere, all hell breaks loose, and the couple ends up with a military team led by an asshole commander (Dorff), who apparently has mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> It's all ridiculous, and the reason I don't really understand it is not just because it's complicated and confusing, but it leaves no room for anyone you really care about. Instead, I highly recommend that, if you have to watch this movie, bring a tennis ball or something to occupy when the plot manages to bore you into confusion. <br /> <br /> Action scenes in a movie with a terrible plot like this should at least make it look a little, right? Too bad, this film is like any other ruined crap ever made, with cuts fast enough to decapitate a chicken cage. Considering that this is based on a horror game, not on an action game, it is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst he has ever seen and the rest is not that great. The demons seem a little cold, even if the fact that they turn to dust when they are killed takes away all that effect. The scenes involving a lot of weapons that should be interesting to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only light source and the camera that zooms and pans faster than the head of an addict. It's all kind of crisis that causes convulsions to keep children in bed at night. <br /> <br /> Acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing. Slater does nothing but seem important to the whole film, even though it seems he has more talent than he is suggesting. The same goes for Dorff, who gets an ungrateful role despite actually having some talent (something that has happened to him a lot). Reid is practically exactly what the underlying sex appeal should be, like every time he tries to act is a disaster (as is the incredibly bad scientist look he has at the beginning). <br /> <br /> In all, this is the kind of film that worries me about future video game films. If they continue to spoil the spirit in this way, it's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing the Middle Easterners with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens. Unlike Resident Evil, however, this does not deserve a second chance, as I don't think anything can help me forget how terrible this movie is. It's tasteless, uninteresting and not very exciting. This is the cinematic equivalent of diarrhea; it's all thrown together, there's nothing really calm and, in the end, you're glad it's over. <br /> <br /> TOTAL: 4%
