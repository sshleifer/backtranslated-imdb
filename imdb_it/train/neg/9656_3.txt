This film is made especially for TV. However, it started with great intentions, with impressive sets and props and authentic costumes. The film quickly degenerated into a horrible dialogue on cheese and made the TV go crazy with melodramatic acting. The characters were so corny that I sometimes thought they were going to degenerate into a stormy puddle of goo, and the action was so twisted and poorly cut that it seemed that the soldiers were simply wandering around and taking turns shooting each other. The Germans were so unrealistically portrayed that it was painful to watch. The only thing the German officers were talking about was how wonderful the Americans were. Please take my word for this. I'm a big fan of the war genre, and this movie sucks. However, this DVD has excellent extra functionality, covering the letters of the front lines of the First World War, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.
