Mann photographs the Alberta Rockies so superb, and Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan give entertaining shows as they always seem to do. <br /> <br /> But come to Hollywood - a Mountie telling the people of Dawson City, Yukon to elect a marshal (yes, a marshal!) and enforce the law themselves, then the gunslingers fighting for the streets for city control? <br /> <br /> Nothing even remotely similar to what happened on the Canadian side of the border during the Klondike gold rush. Mr. Mann and the company seem to have traded Dawson City for Deadwood, the North Canadian for American Wild West. <br /> <br /> Canadian viewers are preparing for a kind of funny howling of Reefer Madness with this ridiculous plot, or, shake their heads in disgust.
