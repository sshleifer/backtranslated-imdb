This film is a Bollywood tradition regarding the power of the star, sentimentality and the love triangle of emotions. What bothered me about this film was the absurd notion of a surrogate mother to the producers. A whore who conceives a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family who wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is not a good candidate for a surrogate mother either. I have seen Indian films and television programs 10 to 15 years ago that treated this problem more intelligently. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and completely implausible. I realize that most Bollywood films are not meant to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be both. This film wants us to appear together with the characters, but this cannot be done with such a ridiculous and artificial conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
