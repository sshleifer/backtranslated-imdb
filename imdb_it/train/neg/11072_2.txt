I saw it on TV last night. Yes, I can hear what you say about this. It is likely to be classified as one of those series of stereo-typical soap TVs. In all honesty, the plot has a beautiful shell, and you could nod, saying, "Well, that's not what I expected." But, as a film, it is not easy to identify a saving element. Casting, acting, camera work, machines, costumes, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. Rated R ?? Oh, that scene. Did we need it? This is a movie that you can watch and then forget that you even watched. And what was the title again?
