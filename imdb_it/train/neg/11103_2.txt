OK, so I just watched the movie, even though it appeared last year ... I thought it was generally a decent movie, except for the plot, which was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never knew nothing about creatures, why they appeared, what are they doing in our world, and indeed, were they on Earth before we were or came from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is so obviously created ... Really, how big could the subsoil be for a substation? There were only so many of those creatures, so I think that instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could just plant some tactical bombs, or maybe cancel their position and a Nuke would do the job. I know it sounds fun and it is, but I don't see the killing of people as NECESSARY ... Thirdly, Leon behaves like Superman jumping on the train and fighting against Vinnie Jones, who was much taller and bigger in stature . Then again, when he confronts the conductor, he does nothing and acts disgusting, observing all the abominations. I mean OK, the host had a creepy help (lol), but if Leon were so brave he would go all the way ... I mean he risks his life first, then he doesn't do anything exactly when he should. He may have died as a hero but to live like a coward ... it might be the case, but not after showing so much courage before ... Then, the police thing ... come on! This was a city with a subway, I bet there must have been other policemen with the exception of that lady, of other police stations, this was really a bit silly ... In short, great acting of Vinnie Jones, an idea interesting to the point behind what is not really built at all ... By the way, what did the marks on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones fails to recover the rest ...
