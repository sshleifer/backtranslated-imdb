The bridges of madison county are a better version of this story. I heard that the end of this film was not handled as sensitively as in the original English film. This film is very indianized, if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when the hero dies you will eventually love this movie, on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think you cry for the weak not like the ending . But overall it's a pretty good topic, it's well run for Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. Everyone has done well.
