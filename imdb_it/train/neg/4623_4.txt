If you haven't seen the gong show TV series, you won't like this movie at all, not knowing that the series makes it a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> I give him a 5 out of 10 because some things make it a little fun to help compensate for his obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It is a fun photo of it had been made, in the late 70s and early 80s. 2) Get lots of funny cameos from people you saw on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (the guest) when he is not making his character on TV. 4) You see a lot of bizarre people who do all sorts of strangeness just like you see on the TV show. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because there are many, but here are some of the most important. <br /> <br /> 1) The Gong Show Movie has many of the TV series that tire at the length of the movie. 2) The plot of the film outside the clip segments is very weak and basically consists of only one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually an actor halfway, but most of the actors behave in a typical way in the maximum flatness of the 70s. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half, you want to see it all at once. Watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But even in this case it is not so good. ;)
