About the worst movie being released right now! I love zombie movies and I saw this in the used rack, so I thought why not? Oh my god, shame about the zombie movies and fans of the genre! Anyone who made this film needs to put the camera away and go to the film school! There are so many blood hunter dogs that have devoted time and effort to their films and have something that this film has no dignity. I know what it takes to make films and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time to make Meat Market, but none of that money and time went to make it good. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make independent films. I don't know how you made a DVD release, but whoever did it is really a good friend or slams his head against the wall. In the movies of blood is the quality and not the quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this was in the shops and I couldn't get my money back. Please, if you've seen this movie, write here and end shlock. I know I'm very hard, I only have 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to the point.
