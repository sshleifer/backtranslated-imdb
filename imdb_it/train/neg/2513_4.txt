When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very funny and sometimes funny, and it's actually a good story, but the "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim The Robbins are able to provide. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but this is the only exception. This film seems a bit forced, the director lacks substance, and oh yes ... the music is incredibly horrible, it didn't put me in a good mood. But if you don't expect an intelligent and well-crafted comedy / romance, then this can definitely be fun, like I said. It should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a relief from Tim Robbins' boring and almost tense search to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very confrontational film, but until it is taken seriously this can be a good movie.
