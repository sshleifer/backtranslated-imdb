I watched this film hoping to find a cute and interesting story, but the plot wasn't good at all. The play of the actors was no better. <br /> <br /> Obviously Shahrukh Khan was there, but it wasn't enough to make this film "believable" and interesting. <br /> <br /> I read that this film was based on the novel by Flaubert "Madame Bovary", but for me I didn't see it in tune with the Indian mentality. <br /> <br /> In general, we buy films to dream and have a good time, not waste our time and change our mood for the worse. I can't understand how he can get such a "high" grade with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> So it's the kind of movie you should run away from and ignore because there's nothing to appreciate inside! You will only waste your time unless you like "dark movie" with "strange and nonsense story".
