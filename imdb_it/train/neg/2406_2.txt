From the mind of Harry Alan Towers comes another piece of cinematic mud. Presumably based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, the only resemblance to what Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (although an Africa that has dinosaurs - that our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!) , And has some characters with the same name. <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) have been searching for the treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up exactly where the treasure is, simply opportunities. Along the way, they encounter a heterogeneous assortment of extremely lame monsters, take a French chef and McCallum has a relationship with the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> It's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. This is the only reason I didn't give him a 1.
