I was bored around 10:00 pm, so I watched this movie. And I couldn't stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the boys acted like they were over 11 just gave me a bad shot. One of the children had a ring, supposedly killed people after about 3 years. It gave me the impression that he wanted to become a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is quite difficult to take young children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They act as if everything were a big problem, as if Billy (the main character) didn't eat worms, then the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for small children (apart from the fact that a 5 year old says "penis"), but not for teenagers or adults who don't want to waste time.
