I'm a horror / goreo movie freak and this movie was so bad, I felt embarrassed not only for the "actors" but also for the director and the poor sap of a producer who actually put his money for it schlock. /> <br /> From the title, you would expect some big carnage, some plot and at least a direction or a dialogue. Instead, you get what looks like a slightly more violent and sexual episode of Three Stooges. At least I laugh at the Three marmittoni. While watching this shit, I turned on another TV and started watching Howard Stern until something interesting happened. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I kept looking at Stern. <br /> <br /> Watching this "movie" I realize that I could produce a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in small change and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to enter the no-budget film. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned ... there is nothing much here but a lot of talk and very little action. This makes "KaZaam" a film by Meryl Streep. <br /> <br /> I am sure that Germany did not ban it because of sex or violence. The other countries must pay attention.
