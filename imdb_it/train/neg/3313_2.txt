How can we say that this film is a comedy? If I hadn't gone with my window I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. I like chick movies, but I hated this. This was the only time I saw so much clevage and it wasn't turned on. Those clothes were definitely exaggerated. No one talks like that anymore and I don't even think they did it then. The dancing part was horrible. My ex told me later ... "Didn't you like that part? Didn't you think it was sensual?" I said yes just to save his feelings. Now I know why we never got married. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
