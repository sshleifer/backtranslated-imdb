This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. He thought it was wonderful because it was so real, "just like people in Ohio Valley do!" I come from the area and I experienced the film as "Just like the people in California think we are!" I lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked there for a minimum wage. We laughed a lot, got together and took breaks with people our age; young people went out together at night. The elderly had little free time after work because they took care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and is not darker in the winter rain than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> In addition to the compliance "if you live in a house built by you" you have to be depressed, the story lacked elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of terror. <br /> <br /> The character of Martha was the worst drawn. It is doubtful that someone so repressed would belong to a church, but if he did, he would probably make friends there. I read reviews that seem to hold that Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was "younger, prettier and thinner" but if this is the case it is not shown. All we really see is that Martha is learning to despise Rose for reasons that would apply the same way if the three friends had the same age and gender. We see that Martha feels excluded during the smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and ultimately disrespected and hurt. <br /> <br /> Just another thing: should we suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had some panic attacks? Please. This brings the stigma against mental illness to a new level.
