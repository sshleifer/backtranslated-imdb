I had been subjected to this film for a couple course in my school. As I thought it was nothing appealing and nothing new. Although he tries to be original by focusing on the adolescent father instead of the mother who shows the problems that the father should have faced. It had an interesting side, but it didn't live up to its originality, because nothing else in this film was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who likes in every other film like this has something against him, we have the homemaker mother who expects too much and when he gives more he feels offended and leaves him in the dust, then we have father who is always gone. Then the girls have parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect in everything she does. On the story as I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting by the whole cast and the lack of good writing or narration. Everything about this fell into a clich√©, the nerd boy at school starts studying with the girl, they get together, have sex and then we have a baby boom. Perhaps it would have been better if the writings had been much better and the acting had improved. I seriously got more emotion from Leatherface and his chainsaw than from any actor in this movie and this is pretty bad to see how the Leatherface films suck and act horribly. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy film I saw was Juno. So far the comic side of this serious situation has been more fun while continuing to give the same message. As I said the idea was original, most of these films focus on the teenage mother, but she chose not to focus instead on her father's drama, but again originality does not save this film from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to do this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another film like that because this was a waste of potential.
