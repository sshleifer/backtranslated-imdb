The Haunted Boat is sold as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways this is accurate. There are fears and strange people that interest you. <br /> <br /> However, acting ability is at its worst poor. Showing clear signs that it is simply a group of friends making a horror film. Which in all merit do to the best of their ability. When you accept the low budget, it is very difficult to get special effects, with ghosts that look more or less like men with rubber masks. <br /> <br /> Many aspects of the film are disturbing and strange. But he suffers from using too many twists in a short amount of time that leaves you bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well. Ignoring the irrelevant twist every 5 seconds near the end, you actually want to know what's going on. And they are willing to wait 1 hour and 35 minutes for the climax. <br /> <br /> This is not a ghost ship, but it will surely do it for an evening in front of the T.V.
