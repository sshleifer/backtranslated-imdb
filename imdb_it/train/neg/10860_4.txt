This was a disappointing film for me. It came to me through a box set called "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift from someone who knows that I generally like films made in that genre (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre). I don't think it's a film noir. Nowadays there seems to be a tendency to label and market all the black and white B films produced from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a male protagonist persecuted, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. These are just the only noir elements I could see. There is no pervasive paranoia, or a real reason why you should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was too dressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I don't want to ruin this film from potential viewers. However, I would be interested to know what other noir cinema connoisseurs have to say about it.
