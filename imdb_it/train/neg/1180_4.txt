Famous for over a quarter of a century (and often banned), darkness was its greatest advantage. Hey, it's often better to talk about it than to see it when you can't support the "legend" with the substance. <br /> <br /> The film has performed in Los Angeles a couple of times recently, and is available on home video, so the veil is slowly removed. While there is still much to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them rather than arouse much passion. With the exception of a free XXX sex scene that lasted between a couple of horses ("Nature Documentary", someone?), It follows almost an hour of a boring combined melodrama. <br /> <br /> Once sex and nudity begin, it is an unbroken sequence involving masturbation, a flashback of an alleged "beauty and the beast", and a naked woman running around the villa (none , not even her. Her supposedly protective aunt even seems to think about putting clothes on her!). On video, I suppose you can quickly advance through banality, but it's not worth it. Nudity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial like Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS. <br /> <br /> Try how you could find some "moral" or "symbolism" in carnality, I doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie more easily, the notoriety of something that was once "forbidden" has been revoked. And this beast has been tamed.
