Anyone giving a good review of this film must have had something to do with its creation. This film is a painful suckfest. The acting is rigid, the generic soundtrack of titles is ridiculous, the direction is insignificant and the strangest of all, the teacher is actually not so attractive (making the student's sensational advances even more embarrassing). The creative minds behind this junk should melt and spread to prevent further manifestations of this concentration. I am sure some hungry children in Africa could have used the money wasted on this project. Hell, the funds would also have seen a more enlightened purpose that fed a crack-addict; at least someone would have some fun. For the sole reason that he has not given me a terminal illness, I will give this film a two.
