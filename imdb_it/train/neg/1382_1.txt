The film was terrible. The theater had died out of silence, because everyone was embarrassed to be there watching the garbage. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and showed him a script with dialogues written by a five-year-old child. Martial arts are "ok", but when they stand next to the Jackie Chan and "The Matrix" films it is better to see one of these.
