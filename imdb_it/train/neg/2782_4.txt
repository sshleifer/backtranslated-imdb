I saw the movie last weekend, I am upset and disappointed with this. Basically, the film tells you that immigrants, especially those from the former Soviet Union, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take delivery of what the Americans have worked for. Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration and a much worse way of telling people. This is the main thing. Another thing, writing, directing and overall filming is at the amateur level of the village. The actors did quite well, but it wasn't for them to save this pile of shit. Some jokes were funny, but most of them were bad and cheap. I couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money back.
