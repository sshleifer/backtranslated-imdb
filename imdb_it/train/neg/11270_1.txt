I've seen bad movies but this has taken p ***. It doesn't make sense, and all the characters swear every couple of seconds, oh and I think one has a low sperm count. It's so good. A Welshman plays an ash pinky. An elegant English man plays an unreliable rogue of a rice paddy, and some minor lights sound like tartrettes. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes, someone has a gun and maybe he talks about garbage while he takes drugs. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague.
