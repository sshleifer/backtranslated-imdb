This type of plot has a lot of potential, but it was slaughtered here. Honestly, I sensed the cheese element in the beginning, but I thought it would improve after the grotesque birth. Whoa, I'm wrong! So a mad scientist makes a monster, he wants to brag to his old friends before he kills them, but of course they run away. After that, it's really bad. I should have counted the times when the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage, but most likely I would have lost count. <br /> <br /> Go down to the blood-dripping leg to show us how the shark-man finds people. I hate being spoon-fed from every aspect of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and after being nearly killed by a mutated man-shark and trudging to an island in the jungle, there's nothing more cheerful than a half-business man playing Shakespeare. .. <br /> <br /> This is one where you'll be rooting for the monster ... if you can stand to watch this excuse for a movie.
