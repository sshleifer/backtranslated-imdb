This film, although apparently a comedy, is deadly serious. Its subject is imperialism (with a capital I): like Britain, foolishly, humiliating, it tries to convince itself that it is still a great power after the Second World War. At home, the Empire is run by lovable sweets, benevolent bulls who are so polite that they cannot distinguish close relatives; the Government Offices consist of archives long forgotten (an excavation in the Orwellian paranoia?), inhabited by indolent rats, and antechambers in which the synapses bored from the living room, reading popular novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, Britain clings to the old pump; but the pump out of context seems worn and silly, especially when it is embodied in clumsy turbid. Carlton-Browne is a non-sentimental image of decline, with none of the tear-gas rot that has spoiled the anti-imperialist jewel in the crown. <br /> <br /> The film also speaks of the Cold War, admitting boldly that it is a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. He talks about how colonialism, characterized more by the neglect of tyranny, destroys the colonies you desert, depriving them of services, power and, above all, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> It is the seriousness, of course, that kills him. This does not mean that heavy subjects cannot be treated in comedy: The Miracle Of Morgan's Creek, Dr. Stranamore and The Life Of Brian all proved it. Indeed, it could be suggested that serious themes should be treated only by comedy - it allows for a clearer view. <br /> <br /> The problem with Carlton-Browne is that every situation must have a meaning beyond the mere, so that it weighs down and unfunny. In the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy stems from the reaction of the character to an extreme situation, not from the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is too poor to support rich comic characterizations, and some of the greatest comedy talents ever assembled - Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John le Mesurier - are criminally wasted. <br /> <br /> Terry -Thomas, so sublime, proves that he was unable to handle lead parts, and that he needed to play scornful, arrogant, non-brainless doodles. The music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on the screen. (To be honest, unlike most of the British comedies of the period, which have been seasoned and undersized, Boulting often try to express their points through the film itself, for editing and composition. Only Huntley manages to elicit real laughter, and this is a character essayist who could have interpreted in his sleep. <br /> <br /> None of Boultings' farces are dated well - they are never thought enough. Although Carlton-Browne enjoys the decline of the Empire, it also seems anti-democratic and militarist. I am sure that this was not intended, but these errors are inevitable if intentions worthy of having precedence over comic intelligence and the form of the film are allowed.
