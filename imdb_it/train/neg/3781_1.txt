(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to throw down 80 million dollars on this extremely tired and lame animated film. They probably thought that spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring the public (mostly families) to see it in droves. Well, it seemed to work for the opening weekend, earned $ 26 mil., Roughly and earned $ 38.1 mil. total (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the public that came over the weekend saw more or less the same thing I did when I saw and spread the word. This is one of the most disgusting films, aside from the animation of everything else, largely the script seems to be made by a three-year-old child. <br /> <br /> The film only lasts 80 minutes. long, but it looks like a three-hour epic. Some critical points for me are, well, the irritating narrative is one of these, and it is so obviously written. At some point he escapes from some kidnappers and even if you can see that the horse is obviously scared, he plays the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clear up any misunderstandings (which would only happen in the simplest of mentalities. <Br /> <br /> Another is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but from Dreamworks he really thinks that the audience would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs in a short film like that, I didn't make it, finally and here there is a spoiler, a horse is shot point-blank by a member of the calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a rushing river, Spirit (the focus of the film) tries to save her, but both go on a waterfall that must have a fall of at least 50 feet, well later in the film towards the end we see that this horse is alive and well I know this is a movie for children, but even that small amount of realism is ina ccettabile. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this is really a limit. I'm not saying kids won't like it, but anyone else will check their watches just waiting for this tripe to finish. Definitely on my list of the top 10 this year. - ** on 4 stars. <br /> <br />
