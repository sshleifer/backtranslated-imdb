From the creators of Shrek ???????? .. Ok, this caught my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, even the creators of Shrek have created Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> It means that Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were extremely good but the film was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this film was meant only for children. It is not seriously possible for adults to really love this movie. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes designed for adults. I bet the kids don't understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite this I like how this movie. <br /> <br /> I am completely disappointed. 4/10
