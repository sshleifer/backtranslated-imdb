I absolutely love all the Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested in seeing a movie made after one of his books. I knew it would not have been possible for the film to capture even half the magic of Robbins, but after seeing the film, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues does not include an eighth of the book's content, and seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than on anything else. Along with the film's extremely weak plot, I think surely the best actors could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the film that I thought played their roles in Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five-minute sequence at the beginning of the film. Who has not read the book could enjoy the film, but as a big fan of Tom Robbins, this film was just a disappointment.
