I read about this movie in a magazine and was intrigued. A woman, who one day sees herself crossing her car. Well, I thought, it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First of all, the title. The broken? The Broken ... what? What's broken? The ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, smart! Unfortunately, this is pretty much the only thing to do. <br /> <br /> The premise is not bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland has done much better in "Mirrors". A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors and a rather mediocre one. A more suitable title would be "The Boring", since it extracts every single scene for bloody periods. Or perhaps "The Confusing" since it explains absolutely nothing, not in fiction or in history itself, only a vague idea of ​​evil and somesuch copies, studded with fear and economic scenes used for death, but nothing tangible. It's just messed up. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, acting and special effects are pretty good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to play. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, maybe a little confused, and not in the way EA Poe or Stephen King. Do yourself a favor and don't look at this. Simply put, there are better thrillers out there.
