Having searched this movie up and down, I actually found it when I least expected it, playing on the Sundance Channel very soon one day. Because I have searched incessantly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris was made during the last years of TV, I have no idea. The film is simply put on horribly. The part with script that takes care of a week that is. Obviously the highlight of the film is to see the real actors "too hot for TV" or rejected for one reason or another. That part is still horrible, but bad campy which was fun in its own way. Now that I've seen what I've been looking for so long, will I look at it again in my life? Noisily NO !! Do yourself a favor and look VERY MUCH better "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" or find old copies of the actual show. The act of the girl licking her ice lollies provocatively was fun, but having to bear to see Jay P. Morgon blink the audience made me likely sterile. In hindsight, I'm so happy that this was a huge flop, because if it was a huge success, there could have been a "The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie" and THAT my friends would surely have brought to the Apocalypse. <Br /> <br /> My Grade: D
