Like most of the comments, I saw this movie with the name of The Witching, which is the title of the reprint. Apparently the necromancy that is the original is better but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most of the witching scenes still include necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think the added nakedness of witching has at least added some entertainment value! But don't be fooled: there are only 3 scenes with nudity and is one of the people around for variety. There is not a bit of an uncomfortable diabolique pump! <br /> <br /> This film is so inherently terrible that it's hard to know what to criticize before. The dialogue is horrible and straight out of the Troma cabinet. At least Troma has a cheeky tongue. This is personified direct boredom. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the child possessed in The innocents would you believe!) The worst with her shrill, high-pitched voice. Welles simply seems to be waiting for his check. The other female protagonist has a disturbing face, so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also seems as worried as Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is impeccably shot with scenes that change for no reason and the editing is unstable. This is because witching is a job of copying and pasting and not one of the subtle ones. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with the new and scary soundtrack that never closes. Even the "ghost" mother is equally disgusting, but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that she at least provides some involuntary laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this film (at least witching) is only for the unwary. He can't have many sensible fans because he is quite unwatchable and in fact I found him incredibly boring! <br /> <br /> The best thing was when the credits were pulled - just say so simply better about this poor excuse for a film like PEST!
