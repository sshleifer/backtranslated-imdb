1) I am not a weapons expert, but I can also see the difference between US army riffles in World War I and World War II. In the film we can see the private characters, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (aka "Silent Death"), which holds its use until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can charge 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire speed! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires reloading after each shot. Little difference ?! 2) German army uniforms have also been borrowed since 1940. Above all - helmets. German helmets have a significant pike until the end of World War I, we can't even see one in the film. And if we do a little additional research in the archives, how true is this "true story"? I am surprised, how "truthful" can a director be in the pursuit of economic propagation.
