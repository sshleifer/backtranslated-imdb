This "film" attempts to follow the kind of low-budget hand-held photographic gestures, which have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This fails, and HOW. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many so-called "prizes" this piece of junk was plastered on the cover ..... it makes you wonder what these critics were when they actually presented this .... <br /> <br /> Words fail to describe how truly shocking this film is. Seriously, it's THAT BAD. I saw it flat in 20 minutes, almost continuously forward. <br /> <br /> From the lighting of waste to the terrible direction, from grainy images to the muffled sound, and obviously not forgetting the acting of ABYSMAL, this was a completely pathetically pathetic piece of the so-called film making. <br /> <br /> And seriously, it has NO redemption qualities - whatever it is. Save your money and watch a decent low-budget horror movie, there are many out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this garbage at all costs. DO NOT waste money or time with this piece of trash by pretending to be a real movie. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to all other comments! You have been warned!
