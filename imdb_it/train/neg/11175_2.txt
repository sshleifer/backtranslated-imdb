Unless someone enlightens me, I really have no idea what this movie is. It looks like a picture with a message, but it's far from it. This film tells a useless story of a New York press agent and his problems. And that's pretty much everything. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it's not hard to think how insignificant and boring this film is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone") which deserves the title "the most boring and the most useless film of the year". So what's going on, Al?
