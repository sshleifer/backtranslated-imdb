I see that someone has already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to my mind after seeing this film. They said the ingredients were there but there was no plot. In addition to the sexual scenes that bordered on child porn (which I think may have been modified or presented in a more suggestive way in nature rather than graphically, I would compare this film to a recipe that was torn in half. A list of ingredients, with no indications on how to put them together in a finished product. From the beginning they lack the development of the character and the development of the story ... unfortunately, many times in this monotonous shot they make fun of pieces of plot and we think "Ahh-OK ... finally we will discover something more about WHY this scene is happening ... or ... WHO is this character ... or maybe we will finally get to know and appreciate this character more ... or understand and involve more with this relationship inter-character ... etc. "But he is not so lucky! On the contrary, many times I have been tempted to turn it off more than once, but I blocked him when the carrot was dangling, only to discover that some and mini-plot inside w The hatever mini-plot (and the badly presented one) was just a ploy. Because I stayed with me until the end it is a mystery, apart from the usual IFC it has better selections and they gave it 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters aren't pleasant to ANY degree, or that you can't identify with them or their humanity ... it's just that this could have been much better with just a little more effort. I noticed that this was shot around Santa Cruz and I found myself wondering if it was someone's film school project. I wanted to give a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.
