No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie got married, it was because they both thought it would help their cinematic careers. If you had the experience of watching "Swept Away", then you know that at that level it was a game made in hell. After almost 20 years of attempts to become a respected actress (or "actress" as she could have said in "The Next Best Thing"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to transform a performance in which anyone likes to it could also be called decent. And that's the thing that makes people so dislike of her on the screen: that feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to let go and connect with her audience. If there is any justice in this universe, she has just blown her last chance.
