A film about Vixen (Erica Gavin) who has a Mountie husband who loves ... but also loves sex! During the film he gets more men in bed - including her husband AND brother! There is also a lesbian sequence (domesticated). <br /> <br /> This film put Russ Meyer on the map and was (I think) the first critically acclaimed X movie. It was a great success when it came out. Unfortunately, it's not dated. <br /> <br /> It is well directed and Erica Gavin is simply fantastic (whatever happened to her) and is VERY colorful ... but by today's standards she is extremely docile. I'm surprised he now has an NC-17 score - there is no hardcore sex and he has only topless females and no male nudity. Furthermore, it is (unfortunately) rather boring and the addition of politics has been confusing (and rather stupid). It is worth seeing to see what was considered very shocking in 1968. Presumably I saw the cut version (which has an R rating), but I only heard a few seconds here and they are missing. <br /> <br /> Meyer's next film "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is much better and goes VERY well. Take it instead.
