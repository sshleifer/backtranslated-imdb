First of all, I'm sorry for having given a rating of 1 to this film (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department either in the script, direction, characterization or acting. <br /> <br /> 1) To begin with, the name of the film is actually class C (even if the film itself matches the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan does his best to live up to the character, but the weak script combined with a pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has a reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag the figure was 100 million for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had only a few men's bicycles to go to work (with all the automatic guns). As for Nisha Kothari, someone has to tell her she can't act. Why is Ram Gopal Verma launching her again and again? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is almost nothing for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the film. 7) The role of legend played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is cheaply replaced in this film by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow up and understand that there must be some intellect in your film. No more stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) I should not say anything about the modern Jai and Veeru ... policy to the maximum extent. <br /> <br /> In summary, I was shocked to see this film because it looks like an economic and comic translation of the original classic. Please don't waste money and time on this film. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst possible movie) would have been a better idea than seeing this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and bad directions. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Saurabh
