The most embarrassing moment of this film is when Brady Corbet says "You have blossomed" towards the end of the film. I'm practically dead. I'm still not sure why the writers put that line in there. Should he create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbird, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much. This movie no. If it didn't have the large drawing paper of the Thunderbirds brand, it would have been directed directly to TV, or boxed in post-production. Perhaps even earlier. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits close and play Busted's "I Thunderbirds go go" song. I can't believe I wasted $ 7 watching this through pay-per-view.
