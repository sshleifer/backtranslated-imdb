Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good and strong plot, but is ruined by rough details throughout the film. I am a younger teenager and I didn't really like this movie. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem fun for younger children. The matrix moves the action, you know it was absolutely fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and returns home where Wendy tried to win. Everything ends up like a typical wellness film when Wendy and her cousin Buddhist monk Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) eventually. So Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
