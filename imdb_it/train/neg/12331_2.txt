One of those "coming of age" movies that should have nostalgia for adults and promises for children. This film has neither nor is it a good excuse to let the body of Sylvia Kristel double with a crazy Eric Brown. To make matters worse, the movie is silly or stupid when it tries to be funny, sexy or dramatic. You laugh awkwardly like we should believe a teenager would go alone to bury a dead woman in his backyard. Consider vigorously why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a double body. As the film went on and on, I began to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had seen Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman which makes us nostalgic for WKRP. Look at this to laugh at the stupidity of others, or the busy performance of Ed Begley Jr., or to wonder how Sylvia Kristel with Jennifer Love Hewitt would be. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from the movies staring at Sylvia Kristel who are not Emmanuelle.
