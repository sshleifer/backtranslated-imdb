If you've ever seen a slasher from the 1980s, there are not many reasons to see it. Originality is often not one of the strengths of slasher cinema, and it is something that this film is seriously failing. There's not much you can say about Pranks, so I'll make it quick. The film was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a group of children who stay in a dorm at Christmas. While I'm in a slasher, someone decides to start catching them and this leads to one of the most boring mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this film was on the Nasty Video list is bizarre because, despite some gory scenes, this movie will hardly corrupt or deprave anyone, and this kind of more boring cuts (Friday 13th for example) is not banned. But then again, there are forbidden films that are much less gory than this (The Witch Who Came from the Sea, for example). However, the conclusion of the film is the best thing about it, as if the audience really couldn't care less about who the aggressor is at this point; it's pretty well done. Overall, this is a dingy and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
