Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be turned into films. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is ruined in adapting from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a big lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he escapes, although the incident was kind of his fault because he wasn't paying attention while driving. The father of the dead gypsy puts a curse on the 3, with our protagonist, Billy (the lawyer) increasingly thin from day to day. Although the film was kept with the book, for the most part, and has the typical ending of the king, the acting was pungent and felt forced. We went from one scene to another without too many intermediate things, a bit like reading the acts in a comedy. King himself made a cameo in the film (a bit like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should remain just that: authors. Leave the acting to the actors. Not that anyone in this movie was so great. I saw the main characters in the movies where they were much better.
