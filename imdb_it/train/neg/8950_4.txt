I heard about this novel a long time ago, many of my friends have recommended me to read it. I searched every place and finally found it. This is a book that every man should read, because he is brilliant and because of his vision. I liked every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and couldn't wait to see it. When in the end I was very disappointed, many things that are in the book are not in the film (I don't think this is a spoiler) that makes the film not logical ... Michael Radford could be a good director but a bad writer. Especially as a bookmaker. The film is not at all obscure, the writing is really bad, the only good thing, even great, is acting. John Hurt is an extraordinary actor and the only face I could see myself as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> What angers me most is the people in IMDb who called this "The Best Adaptation Ever" without even reading the book! Or know something about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the genius of the story by reading the book, don't consider it as an alternative. As a book fan, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The points I gave for this film are acting.
