I imagine you have to give some points for the pure courage of writing a musical around a history lesson, but how about a decent music? <br /> <br /> Is Howard DeSilva's cartoon acting aimed at stimulating the interest of otherwise tired children? <br /> <br /> Is the contemporary (for the moment) acting style of William Daniels drawn to a demographic of the 60s / 70s? <br /> <br /> Do we need all the "jokes" on NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience snickering at the right time.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find that the whole piece is dated, boring and too strident for the screen
