This film is a promising start and then becomes very confused and confused. Kamal Hasan has made a lot of efforts to make the period look right, too bad he didn't spend more time on the plot. Most of the little characters in the film present themselves for no particular reason. <br /> <br /> Overall very disappointing, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
