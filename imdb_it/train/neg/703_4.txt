University students, who are cleaning up a doomed dorm, are chased by an elusive assassin. <br /> <br /> The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a mixture for slasher fans. The production values ​​of the film are quite low and the plot is for the most part quite ordinary, there is even a creepy bum wandering around a red herring. Indeed, much of the accumulation of history is rather forgettable, except for one or two brutal murders. But the film is made really better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric environment) and a fairly bold and unconventional conclusion. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly lackluster. Stephen Sachs is the best of all, since he has a turning point in the character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an unlucky student. <br /> <br /> Besides all this, it is a standard B effort, but the ending deserves to be appreciated and for this viewer it has saved the film from being a complete ho-hum. <br /> <br /> ** on ****
