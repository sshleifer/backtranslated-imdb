Somewhere within this film is a half-hour episode from The Twilight Zone that tries to get out. While Cube was tense, well done, claustrophobic and engaging the mind, I fear that Cypher is a swollen and boring review of various well-worn themes that do not add up to much, especially if you've seen almost all of the other sci-fi movies halfway before. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to drag himself through his relatively short 95 minutes to the incompetent finish. None of the characters triggers each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is really poor. It is difficult to link this tired and uninspired film to the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's definitely not a good movie. <br /> <br /> When you saw the grass grow dry and paint and you are bored by your wick insects, look at this movie with all your senses, but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating.
