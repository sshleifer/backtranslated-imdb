I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit, it wasn't my cup of tea. Although it should be a horror film of its kind. But while I was watching this, I was thinking .. "This movie doesn't make any sense ..." Where the hell did this guy in the dark coat come from? Where were the two boys going when they left the girls behind? Where does a shark come from? <br /> <br /> All these elements in this film somehow did not add up. I felt like these filmmakers had wasted so much time and money on a movie that was so destined to be so lousy. I've seen many good horror movies in my day, but this is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. At the end of the film, I told myself that I would not watch it again ... So much show in this film, I decided to give him the thumbs down! Contact me about this! 0 out of 10!
