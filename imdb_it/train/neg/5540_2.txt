After seeing Revolt Of The Zombies with the future Oscar winner Dean Jagger, I was left with a burning question. How has a company that created these latest warrior combat machines been defeated in the first place? <br /> <br /> This is the question you will be pondering if you take the time to look at Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of World War I, the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia where these undead creatures that cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go to the top and dislodge the Hun. <br /> <br /> This frightens the living fecal matter from all concerned, so an international expedition is formed to discover that it destroys the secret of these zombies so that no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world. <br /> <br /> But we have had some dissent in those ranks. The first is the evil Snidely Whiplash Roy D'Arcy who kills the Buddhist monk who has the secret and the second is Dean Jagger. Power is the maximum aphrodisiac as we all know and is determined to woo Dorothy Stone from rival Robert Noland. <br /> <br /> I think you have some idea of ​​how this comes out, especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for just one country. Dean Jagger, who won the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High, must have shuddered every time he thought of this film and the terrible dialogue he tried to give a spark of sincerity. <br /> <br /> Moral of the story, you could become a supreme warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie song, but you can't become a love slave par excellence.
