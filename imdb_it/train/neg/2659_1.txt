I'm sorry but it's just awful. I told people about this movie and a part of the bad acting that is in it and almost don't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, today's Japanese troops have been dragged back in time to the days of Busido's warriors and with their modern weapons they are a challenge to almost everything. When the troops understand that something strange is happening, every single person in the back of the transport must say "Hey, my watch has stopped"? Imagine that such lines are repeated more than 15 times before they say anything else and in a few words you have the lack of the movie's size.
