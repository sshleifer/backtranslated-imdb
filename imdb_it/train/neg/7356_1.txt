In this film, just as it started, on an afternoon when I was at home with a touch of influence, otherwise I would have been lost. Probably would have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas, both very good, and I thought it might be worth a look. It has proven to be to a certain extent, but only because it is one of those terrible stories that fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents, except for Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson-like breast. Unfortunately, his acting ability - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson look like a Garbo or a Davis by comparison. <br /> <br /> The white rat of the young briefcase, the owner's cat, the young case with the owner evicted and kept at his house, and a group of doophus (including the young case of nuts) that ran around a bio hazard structure, and the absurd conclusion. I kept waiting for at least some element of the plot or plot to contain at least a minimum of realism, credibility or ability to evoke empathy / compassion, but this proved to be in vain.
