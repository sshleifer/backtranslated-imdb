I knew that from the moment we met it wasn't a fight between me and D-wars. First his title was lazy. D war. Like writing, Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you can't be so brash with your title except with your blue monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever it wants. <br /> <br /> The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the mad progression of history. Here's the movie, the dreamer boy reporter talks about big snake tracks, flashes back on a time when he and dad broke into what must have been the competition for the gremlins shop and the dreamer kid reporter finds a box that shines. The old shop reveals many terrible truths. That Bauraki an alleged evil snake was robbed of his chance to be a god. he tells the boy that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in Los Angeles he is his reincarnated lover and gives him a piece of jewelry. Shop keep also reveals that, despite its obvious candor, it is a 500 year old Asian. <br /> <br /> fifteen years later the dreamer reporter remembers him perfectly and starts acting like crazy trying to find this girl at random. CGI hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts from my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the balls. <br /> <br /> so Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her flashbacks. I have the advantage of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to scare and create a group of posters with Asian characters on them she tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what they're doing. She is a Korean legend and reincarnated as a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that night his dragon starts to hurt, she calls the police because she looks like she has a heart attack. You see, in this crazy mixed world apparently they handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she is locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she is crazy. Now I have a new phobia, and if I'm ever in trouble the first responders think I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point of contention with my strict lover, Dwar. There's a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a bar with a cheeky black friend. In the scenes before the deity Miffed Near Bauraki killed an elephant, crossed a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. You see, people were afraid to go out after September 11th, but we must have all hardened them after the decisive coffee and the pastries were worth risking our lives for us. Business as usual, in no way will a giant snake prevent me from taking caffeine. If I stay inside and I fear for my life, the terrorists and serpentine gods win. <br /> <br /> After receiving a satisfying dragon in a helicopter battle, my cruel lover Dwar tells me about a scene full of more vinegar to end it all. Bauraki has its own fortress and its right under the creed. They don't actually say it, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah are thrown out in a car accident that would kill inferior men and when the dragon palace will wake up, yes. some dialog boxes delayed after a good snake god dragon bursts out of nowhere and snakes struggle / make love whatever. And I'm not making fun of a good snake from nothing. Maybe you think I'm smashing out of proportion, I'm not mentioning this thing in the movie then suddenly ... there! A few seconds later, the good dragon becomes the god of dragons, ignites Baurki, Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with the dragon god, a dreamy reporter left in the middle of credits anywhere ... thank god <br /> <br /> Now our relationship as rocky as its good times had been. There was a guy who looked like a turtle shredder and he talked exactly like a Tuskan star warsman. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted, but it could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where it wasn't useful. He could go into your dreams when that would have been useless and he could light ten random soldiers on fire, but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like it because it was hit by a car twice in the same scene and created fantastic tuskan raider noises. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors were fantastic ... if large in any way meant terrible. Jason Behr, who I thought was wonderful in Roswell, I slowly discover that he can only act one way and this is pretentious, spatial and Patrick Dempsey "Ish". The only thing I love about this nasty prostitute Dwars is her main actor, Bauraki. That giant snake recited his heart. I would have the courage to say that he was better at playing a divine demigod of evil than evil, then John Barrymore played Richard III or Hamlet. There was an emotion in every scene, stealing the thunder from his minor cast of deadly support. When eating an elephant it seemed to me that no past, present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much sensitivity. He was more of an actor, he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this damn project. Yes, damn it, my favorite actor in this movie was a CGI snake. I have the balls to admit it, right? <br /> <br /> Here he hopes that Bauraki has more work and is not a cast of type, that Jason Behr finds a range of emotions different from those of dreams, and that I must never again see Blue Monkey. <br /> <br /> So, D-War is over. I want my CDs back and we're just friends
