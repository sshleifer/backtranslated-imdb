As someone who was baffled by the incredible images of "Hero", I was anxious to see this film that was published on the same lines as, but better. He also introduced an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed on both counts. I bought the DVD of this movie at first sight, and this was a mistake. It wasn't better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these flying martial arts films are pure fantasy, but this story is so far from anything remotely believable it made me shake my head from disappointing disbelief. A blind woman who defeats hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it's going a little far. Moreover, the main male character "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, his stupid expression on his face and his stupid laugh, which also ruined the film. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and incredible action scenes, this story - for me - did not have a charm to make it a movie worthy of owning. This film is not a "hero" of mine!
