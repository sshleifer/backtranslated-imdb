One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How to define "worst?" I'd rather have both pads by the eyes torn off and then be forced to dance on them than ever see this pitiful dreck again. Somehow, One-Hit Wonder Zwick runs a movie that offends both Elvis, Mary Way saleswomen, Las Vegas, gay, FBI agents and the rest of humanity with any intelligence with a poor and sloppy farce at the same time. so forced that it deserves to be abandoned. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of real Elvis songs to be used in a movie with a central premise that seems to be "The only good impersonator of Elvis Presley is a dead man" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and that requires some work - is the mutilated script: in 1958 the words and songs of Elvis were cited that he would talk / act in the 70s! Worst special effect? The Oscar would go to the moron who decided that Elvis's tomb, potentially the most photographed / recognizable tomb in the world, looks like a pyramid with a gold disk glued to the top and is in the middle of a park for some time part. Potentially, this film's biggest audience would be Elvis fans. However, the unbridled stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA badge, not the FBI credentials ... and I could go on and on) actually subtracts that conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is truly a horrible and horrible film.
