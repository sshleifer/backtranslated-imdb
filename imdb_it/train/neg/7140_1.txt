You already know how painful it is to watch this movie. But I wonder why one of the worst films ever has to include one of the most beautiful cars. Because cars should be not only victims of the violation, but also the only real actors and performers. So, as on Earth, you, Porsche, Lamborghini or anything else, you could let those people get in touch with your cars and ruin the reputation you give them by the millions. Stop getting a head start on the machines and earn money on the chest. It is painful for those who love cars. It is painful for those who love movies. <br /> <br /> I want my money back !!!
