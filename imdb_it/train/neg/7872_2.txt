Anyone who wants to become an editor should watch this movie! It shows you about every mistake you can't make when editing a movie! My grandmother could have done better than that! But that's not the only reason this movie is really bad! (Actually it's so bad that I can't write a sentence without an exclamation point!) If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a pretty good family comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues, this sequel is badly copying the recipe for first The fun parts could be counted on one side and maybe half. Clavier is exaggerating his role even more than in the first part, Robin is trying to behave like Lemercier (because he is replacing it) but is "grotesque". Lemercier is Lemercier, Robin is Robin! Even though Muriel Robin can be fun alone on stage, she's not in this movie because she doesn't act like she used to act. I know it should be difficult to replace someone who was good at a role (Lemercier got a César award for his role in the first film) but he made a big mistake: instead of playing the role, he played Lemercier who plays it '! As for the story, it's really too much! Of course we knew at the end of the first film that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should have tried to write a simpler story like the first episode. The gags are repetitive, childish and déjà-vu. No, really, there are no more than 3 fun parts in this. The only good things could be costumes and some special effects. So you only have 2 reasons to watch it: 1) if you want to learn how to change a movie terribly, 2) if you want to waste time or if you really need a "mindless moment"! 2/10
