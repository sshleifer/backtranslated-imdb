The Haunting is yet another horror remake with exaggerated special effects and a cast of favorites on the screen and has no ransom, except perhaps for cinematography. Yes, the remakes are not all negative, but the remakes directed by Jion Da Bont certainly are. I suppose the A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) are there to distract us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects and terrible attempts to scare the public, however this is a film not a scandalous magazine we don't care to whom we are interested in the characters and the two things that this film has missed. The plot is like taking the classic The Haunting Of Hill House and tearing four chapters and then using what's left for the film is so boring and many are inexplicable. The characters are rather thin and while the acting is good, you are not interested in any of the characters at all. Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and seems to be 8 years old when she delivers her lines, not to mention what a horrible sciamer she is. Lily Taylor is not made for the horror genre. The ghosts are stupid and mischievous, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat man dressed as a ghost reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine. There is a creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a gigantic purple mouth and it is not even amusing unintentionally simply sad. The house is nice and well designed which is probably the only positive thing about this movie that looks nice but that doesn't save it from its brutal everything else. I can honestly say that I felt like I was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no money so I would have been even luckier if I had paid to see it, but luckily it was on Scream Channel. Overall, The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with negative special effects, a poor attempt at horror.
