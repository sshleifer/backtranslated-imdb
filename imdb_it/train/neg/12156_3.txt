Jesus Christ, I can't believe I wasted time watching this movie. I just watched because I have such a crush on Jordan Ladd. But watching this movie almost robbed me of her. This is absolutely horrible! I could have watched Survivor Series 93 on this one. <br /> <br /> The protagonist in this was so bland and generic. I would really like it if the great Mistuharu Misawa Tiger Drove had his ass pulled out through a glass window. I was angry every time he said "lake" and "cabin". I'd kick him in the ass. <br /> <br /> Jordan Ladd, on the other hand, was absolutely wonderful. A true angel. But she couldn't even save the umpteenth joke of a movie. Unfortunately, he couldn't even act like he was crazy when he took that drug of truth. It seemed fun. <br /> <br /> I also loved the piece in which Jordan accidentally spilled yogurt on her. It reminded me of a moment when ... it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> Anayways, watch this movie because it's horrible.
