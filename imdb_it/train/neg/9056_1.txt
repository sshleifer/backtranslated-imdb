I've seen some bad movies in my life, but this has to be among the worst. Surely the underlying material 100 (imo, that is). <br /> <br /> We follow two pairs, Dodd (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car during a trip to Reno. <br /> <br /> Apparently, Lonnie is not very happy with her sex life, so she cheats on his wife with Candy, who is desperately trying to have a baby. Roy, meanwhile, isn't too sure if his sperm is OK, so he has it checked by a doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, I had read the back of the DVD, but my girlfriend didn't, and she snapped out after about 20 minutes: "oh yes, she'll end up pregnant but her husband can't have kids." Spot on, as this film is really predictable. As well as boring. It's annoying. Nonsense. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how this film stinks. The two couples depart with their big car towards Nevada, when they are stopped by 2 police officers, since they do not stop at a stop sign. The boys know each other and finally corrupt the two officers with a case of beer. Not only is this scene useless and not important (or even relevant) for the film, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking, talking and talking, never going anywhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to vomit thinking about the ending though. Apparently, Roy has NO problems over there so he's the baby's father. How many times it happens in the movies ... try something new! The betrayed wife eventually forgives her husband and best friend for having had the relationship and they all live happily ever after. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the film is right at the end, with a couple of shots of the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they keep the camera on for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> You would expect more from this cast (although Thornton really tries), but you can't really blame them. Writers, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
