It's not the most well-made slasher movies of all time, but for what it is, it's pretty funny. The plot is lame, but the killings are not so bad. I have to be honest, if you don't follow the bands in this movie, you won't find this movie as fun as those that do. I knew someone who saw this movie and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film, but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time to be on tour, between playing with children and drinking with friends backstage. ..it is not meant to be taken seriously. It's a drunk cheese at its best in punk and with over 100 kills, most of which are extremely bloody, it's a fun movie to have friends to watch, drink and have fun!
