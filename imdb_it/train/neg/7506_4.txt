Good actors and good performances cannot mask a useless script, wrong dialogues and behavior patterns that unfold in nothing you care about. The most interesting character is David Berkowitz. No character development - no growth, no interest, just some suffering without a particular reason, teaching us nothing or even worrying about entertaining.
