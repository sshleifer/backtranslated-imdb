Why do people who don't know that a particular moment in the past was like feeling the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and Apollo moon landing with the sinking of the Titanic and you'll have a realistic film like this formulaic soap opera entirely populated by low-waisted trash. Is this what children who were too young to go to Woodstock and who failed in school composition? "I will show those old puppies, I will put out my film and I will show that you don't have to know anything about your topic to earn even more money!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing he watched this film did for me was to give me a little insight into the thought of the underclass. The next time I see a slut in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I run the other way. It is an abuse on minors to let parents who grow without value generate children. The abuse of the public does nothing but paste Woodstock and the lunar landscape into a film as if this ipso facto meant that the film portrays 1969.
