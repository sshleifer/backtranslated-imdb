First of all, let me say that I am a big supporter of Fanpro's things. I see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been canceled. Star Trek Voyages and Star Wars Revelations are examples of decent efforts. So I have a soft spot for fanpro stuff, which means I will neglect the things I normally should be doing difficult. <br /> <br /> Then on ST: HF. Well, first of all good things. Enthusiasm is an important part in making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships seems to have spent time with its roles. Subsequently, the effects are not bad for a home-made effort, with nothing that can really make you start. The stories are not so bad. Nothing particularly innovative, but fairly solid stuff and at least there are narrative arcs in progress. <br /> <br /> But it has many flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all, although they obviously have HAVE to re-stock Star Trek movies, set backgrounds, music and effects, I see no reason why they proceeded to tear up virtually every other sci-fi soundtrack ever made . Everything from aliens to spaceships, the troops make them go crazy in one place or another. Likewise, much of the footage comes from other films, devotedly subjected to CGI to make it different. Gray warships, for example, though masked, are obviously Star Wars Star Destroyers. And the station is also quite obviously the battlefield of the Ticonderoga fleet of Starship Troopers. Similarly, the sound effects of various Star Wars movies appear in the space battles between fighters, as well as animated shoots. In a scene from the first or second season, I think, you even see two TIE fighters flying over during a battle, which barely makes one suspect disbelief. <br /> <br /> Acting varies from the reasonable to the horribly painful to watch. But everyone gets better as the seasons progress, but they wait to make faces on the screen, especially in the first few seasons. They also made some interesting acting choices. Let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem to be permanently set up as "sweet" and let it go. <br /> <br /> The effects of make-up are generally quite effective overall. But they really should kill without mercy the person who decided to use cheap Ferengi and Cardassian masks for purposes other than basic or "outdated". I'm just beyond unrealistic. Every time I saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) I kept hoping that the unfortunate soul would wear it to pull out a gun and announce "This is a stick!" In a scene a "Cardassian" really talks while wearing one of these. Not only do the lips not move, but the mask does not even have an opening where the mouth should be. Someone has to be slapped for that. They couldn't have taken a craft knife, for heaven's sake! There are also some well-made but unintentionally fun make-up jobs, such as Herman Munster. <br /> <br /> Writing, although consistent, is nothing new. Instead the script works as a continuation of DS9, with ships starting at DS12 in various missions. The new enemy, "The Gray" is not very threatening and the plot that involves them is in fact a reworking of the Borg threads. that is, Starfleet meets Gray, Gray is enormously powerful, Starfleet barely escapes their lives, so through technology they begin to find ways to fight the enemy etc. etc. All done first with the Borg. <br /> <br /> Another point of contention is dialogue. Star Trek writers have long had the opportunity to write "insert technobabble here" in a script. It usually means an exposure of the top floor to fight the enemy using "quantum phase discriminators" or "isolitic charges" etc. In other words, absurdity that tells you I'm on the case and a resolution is at hand. > <br /> Words are really incomprehensible. I have no problem with this, but where ST: HF makes a mess is where they include real-world comments in this concept. <br /> <br /> Tactical advice such as "We need to reorganize" sounds good, but not when pronounced by a trio of characters already standing in a group. In the same way, when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard replying "Let's count three battleships". Did he really need to count them? Come on, come on! I expected the interrogator to ask him "Are you sure?" or "You can double check". But my favorite comment of all time is this: <br /> <br /> Captain: "Can we establish a two-way communication?" <br /> <br /> Communications Officer: "No, we can only send and receive .." <br /> <br /> Well, duh! ..... <br /> <br /> Having said all the above, the show improves as it progresses. The seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4 and 5 are where it starts to improve noticeably. Season 6 so far seems reasonable enough. <br /> <br /> But I have a problem with the choice of media for the shows. Quicktime sucks, frankly and the sooner they switch to the divx / avi format, the better. Some of us love to take our downloaded shows and watch them on a decent-sized screen and not look at a small QT window on a computer monitor. Quicktime not only makes this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution in which the shows are present does not fit at all well. In fact, it makes the shows rather unwatchable, as if they were a copy on VHS tape of the tenth generation. The least they could do was include a high resolution downloadable option. <br /> <br /> However, the show has promises and I'm even starting to like some of the characters. But it's 40 episodes, so I'm not sure this says much about character development. <br /> <br /> But what can you say, it's free .... <br /> <br /> PS: Out of 28 votes, 19 people voted this show as 9 or 10. Hmmmm ... we were watching the same show? Or are you all 19 years old?
