No matter how you watch this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you look at it like a horror movie, then it is an unpleasant film with monsters that are puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, you will notice that most of the humor falls flat and is simply lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a love story you'll wonder why a guy would be with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an action that you can't really attract for the plaintive hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie fails to provide anything remotely fun. As mentioned, the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins-type film. But this one has the worst monsters of that kind. The Critters seemed pretty good, like the Ghoulies, the Munchies puppets seemed better than they, too. The characters in this film are absolutely unlikely. The hero is a whining security guard, his girlfriend always complains, they have a bum friend who has a military boyfriend and another friend who is a friend. At one point in the film the hero and the military fight with rakes ... this film is absolutely stupid. I like the scene when I'm in the fearsome scum of the club (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I watch more young of none of them.
