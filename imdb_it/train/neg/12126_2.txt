Here is yet another Diane Lane movie in which he betrays her husband. Is this the only role you know how to play? This time it's set in 1969 and she betrays her husband with her blouse. I'm not so surprised because it's very predictable. Then her husband gets angry and throws the milk. I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman. I wouldn't be surprised if he slept with the ice cream maker because this is a very boring movie. Then, after throwing some milk, she says sorry and sees the shirt again. Duh. Then while she is doing it with him, her son is stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones in a wasp nest. This mother for children didn't have time to tell him, she was too busy with the man in the shirt.
