*** SPOILER *** Do not read this if you think you are watching that movie, even if it would be a waste of time. (By the way: the plot is so predictable that it doesn't make any difference if you read it or not anyway) <br /> <br /> If you're wondering whether to see "Coyote Ugly" or not: don't do it! It is worth neither the money for the ticket nor the VHS / DVD. A typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick", one might say. The plot itself is so superficial that it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the American dream. The young and beautiful girl from a small town is becoming a big hit in New York. The few desperate attempts to give up the film fail in depth, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" of Violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. McNally (director) tries to arouse the public's compassion and sadness has no chance of succeeding in this attempt because of bad screenplay and superficial acting. Especially Piper Perabo completely fails to convince one of the "Jersey's" fear of singing in front of an audience. The only good (and rather amusing) thing about "Coyote Ugly" is John Goodman, which represents the small ray of hope for this film. I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer had produced this film. First "Gone In 60 Seconds" and now this ... what happened to great films like "The Rock" and "Con Air"? That was real Bruckheimer stuff. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a superficial movie with good-looking women just to spend a relaxing evening, you should go see "Charlie's Angels" (it's much more fun, fun and self-deprecating) instead of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down (3 out of 10).
