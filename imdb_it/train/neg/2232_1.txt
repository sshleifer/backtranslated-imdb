I watched this ... let me rephrase ... I suffered because of this because I'm a fan of Eva. I don't think this is a film that you will put in a photo. I like gangstaflix but this wasn't even close. The budget couldn't have been more than a few hundred dollars, and that money was probably spent on catering. <br /> <br /> The premise was interesting, but the first victim died before you had the opportunity to worry about her or not. <br /> <br /> I won't bother to say who did what and how, because it's not worth it. I'm glad that because of my monthly rent plan at the local video store I didn't have to pay for this junk. <br /> <br /> OH !! Before you get hot, I love movies, I thought a lot of flix was good that some of you got jammed, so to get me confused this tells you everything you need to know.
