"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing he could have done after the disappointment of the fifth movie. It started from scratch. Of course, this "final" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the images are even a little breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's son (Lisa Zane) who returns to town to face his evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is nothing more than another cartoon made to have children in the theater. He has a lot of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who basically look stupid and run like sheep ready for massacre. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick and, in the end, it's nothing but foolish, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
