Unusual? Yup! <br /> <br /> Unusual scenario for an American war movie, New Zealand. <br /> <br /> Unusual topic, four sisters and their relations with American soldiers, from one who brings the illegitimate son of a senator's dead son, to another who lives with seven marines (one at a time) before to be assassinated by his return as a New Zealand husband. <br /> <br /> Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a poor performance shortly after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". An unusual for two beautiful "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves in a film. /> <br /> Unusual that I might be bothered to write a review of such a poor film, give it a shot!
