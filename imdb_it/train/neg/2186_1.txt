... but I ask you if we had one in the first place! This film is just as ugly as any horrible horror of today. A man walks around half-dressed ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. A scene involves a man who stumbles around the whole set for a full three minutes, covering everything that must be well over ten liters of "blood". The film also tries to create the feeling that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so poorly made that it is impossible for the public to overthrow any feelings of shock or indignation. Shamefully dark and incredibly sinister, this film cannot even have its straight title - the end credits say "The brain that wouldn't die", but the credits list it as "The Head That would not Die".
