The hardest thing about this film is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotyped "white-trash", the "plot" of the film was stunted from the beginning, and the worst feature of this film was that the nudity was so blatant that the double of the body was fun. Unfortunately, that was the only funny thing in the movie. Mrs Jenkins would have been better served if in the future she refrained from using her life story to "entertain" people. It was just so bad. The only positive aspect of this film (this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film) is that my brother has paid the money for this stinker.
