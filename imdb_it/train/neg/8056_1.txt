Anthem, boring and inconsistent supernatural "thriller" in which the university student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of her boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can't begin to tell you how bad this is ... nothing important ever happens, nor is there any kind of real entertainment value. I did not like this cast in this particular film - they are unfortunately all unconvincing (even in this case their roles are not good). Promoting it as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the fears? It doesn't make sense or suspense - there are some good songs but that's all about it. <br /> <br /> Why did this project go ahead? Screenwriter and director Steve Carpenter doesn't have a recognizable vision or talent that I can perceive. Worse still, the conclusion really makes the whole movie useless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut" I saw is 86 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> 1/10
