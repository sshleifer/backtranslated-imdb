I couldn't help thinking behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon (an incredibly bigger film) when you look at this because of the realistic feeling and the great innovative idea. this could have been a great movie. acting is ... by some actors is fine. from the others ... it's definitely horrible. <br /> <br /> Apart from the idea is fantastic and the format is great. the story is pretty good, though it often suffers from big blows to the logical mind. <br /> <br /> Doesn't it matter that it's true? It is a horror film after all. I really want to see this remake ... I really want it to be the fantasy movie that it wants to be. <br /> <br /> however (and you can't really criticize the mind behind the movie for this) this is obviously built on a shoe string budget. and fx really hurt the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> great movie. ... if I had to trade for better acting and a little better fx. <br /> <br /> whoever wrote it should continue anyway, great idea here.
