WE FAW DOWN <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Film) <br /> <br / > Stan 'n' Ollie mix with a couple of floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after moving into a theater that burns in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... <br /> <br /> Leo McCarey's comedy OK has laid the narrative basis for William Seiter's masterpiece, SONS OF THE DESERT ( 1934), with L & H playing on the eyebrows of circumstances, forced to recount a monstrous lie that twists spectacularly. Much of it is a lot of fun, especially the scene where Stan is mocked by Deslys, leading to a violent play of pushes and thrusts. However, part of the fun is undercut by Oakland and Flowers, playing their roles completely linearly, which adds an unpleasant aspect to the "tormented husband" scenario. Originally published in the UK as WE SLIP UP.
