This film should not be classified as a cinema. Although he is now over 10 years old, he should never, ever get funding, and it is a scourge for the Australian film industry, which is producing such brilliant films as "The Dish" <br /> <br /> The Actors can't act, music is .. to be blunt, not to music, the plot is completely non-existent and it's a struggle to sit. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It's a complete waste of your time.
