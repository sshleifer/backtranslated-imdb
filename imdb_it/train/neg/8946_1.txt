I think the shots and the lighting were very poor. When I first saw it I thought it was the old version (1956). When I really discovered the real year of the film, I was shocked. I didn't know there could be such a bad movie made so recently. This is all I wanted to say. However, this film has had a good storyline, nothing you couldn't miss if you had just read the novel that George Orwelll wrote. All I want to say has already been said, except for this: I can't believe this movie could have received so many awards and nominations. I gave this film a (terrible) one, because I felt it was very badly done. Well, that's all. So long
