Whodunit pretty crazy with an all-black cast trying to figure out who murdered the trumpeter who was going to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His aspiring girlfriend? His father? His butler? The journalist? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little overwhelming, and the actors here don't really put me in a mood to worry about finding out one way or another. Why poison snake as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares? The music in this is fine, but there is little, and most of it is pretty "let's stop with" This is not worthy of your time. There are better completely black cast movies out there.
