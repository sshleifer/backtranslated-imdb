for all the subtle charm that this student film can hold, was anyone else bored to death waiting for WENDINGO to show his macho paper face ?? <br /> <br /> the anti-climax has pretty much ruined every kind of momentum we've had to develop. <br /> <br /> don't get me wrong, I'm exploring all of the dark side of America, but this is a turd-a-flamb√© that makes a nod to watermark just because Clarkson looks hot taking it. <br /> <br /> unfortunately, from a boy with wings. <br /> <br /> the best 2 minutes the film has to offer. <br /> <br /> if I felt like tearing away DELIVERY, we could do better.
