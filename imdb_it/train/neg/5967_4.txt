Think, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to create "employees". How the hell did they spend $ 45 million to make this glorified music video? An almost unknown cast, two or three sets, with no special effects that I could see ... I know, it must have been spent on that script full of skill, cheap, full of tension. Shoot, that set of bars must have cost a package. However, I imagine that Jerry Bruckheimer would not be captured without producing anything with less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow anything up. <br /> <br /> However, it wasn't a terrible film, I guess. The female voices seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been realized for $ 5 million without any loss to production, and 6 more $ 5 million indy films could have been made.
