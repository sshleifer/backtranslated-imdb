It is curious that the two stars of Meet The People were a pair of movie stars who entered the new television medium and became even greater successes and both entered production at the end of things and enjoyed the status of magnates on the small screen. Lucille Ball however was not an important star, who would come with television. As for Dick Powell, he wanted desperately to get out of films like Meet The People and his career would come in his next film. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason Dick Powell made the film was because a young MGM player was cast in a specialty number and he was seeing it at the time. His private time with June Allyson was far better than what we see on the screen. Powell looks bored in a cruel way and fails to evoke any kind of emotion. <br /> <br /> He was probably tired of making these musicals with stupid plots, of the kind that Warner Brothers came from. The original show Meet The People was not a book show, it was a revisitation and it worked in the 1940-41 season on Broadway for 160 shows. When MGM bought it, he deleted everything except the title and the title song. The rest of the score has been patched up by various and various songwriters, none of the songs is memorable. Strange when one considers that some of the original materials come from Burton Lane, E.Y. Harburg, Harold Arlen and Rodgers & Hart. These guys just need to have emptied the boot for the material. <br /> <br /> The plot is more foolish than most of the musical propaganda pieces of the time. Powell is the writer of a magazine called Meet The People and is a shipyard worker who wins a lottery date with movie star Lucille Ball. She is interested, interested, both are interested in the magazine, but the creative differences keep them separate until the end. This is the film in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> MGM gave Powell and Ball some good musical acts that are the main reason to watch Meet The People. The great bands of Vaughn Monroe and Spike Jones are here and the highlight of the film for me is Bert Lahr dressed in a salesman suit like Lou Costello did in the dream sequence of In The Navy. The song Heave Ho was written by Arlen and Harburg who wrote for Lahr, the Courage issue of the Wizard of Oz. And since almost everyone in the world saw that movie, you have an idea of ​​Heave Ho. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell's next film was Murder My Sweet, in which he finally offered a not so passionate adoration of musicals. And Lucy would have to wait for the television before the world could see what it could really do.
