I would like to start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a middle-aged man apparently unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing and manipulative father, he was incredibly light and fun to watch in practice. In my opinion, it is undoubtedly one of the biggest British sitcoms of all time. The TV series has my rating of 10 out of 10 without a reservation. <br /> <br /> This spin-off of the film on the other hand is a real tragedy in every sense of the word. Almost no essence of the TV show is successfully transferred to the film. This film has a very depressing and depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Seeing Harold being beaten up in a pub (and not in a comedy way) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but it is certainly one of the reasons why TV series fans won't appreciate this movie. The film was painfully little fun except for the scene where Albert bathes in the sink and is seen by a neighbor. <br /> <br /> The love story between Harold and Zita is completely out of tune and I wonder if the producers of this film ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the TV series, Harold always went after respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's reactions to the comments made against him by Harold's friends were absolutely priceless in the TV series. In the film, Albert says practically nothing when such an opportunity increases. <br /> <br /> Most British sitcoms spin-offs tend to be rather boring, with the notable exception of the ON THE BUSES movies (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series!) . But STEPTOE AND SON rank right at the bottom of the pile, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My tips: skip this and see the second spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much lighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually a lot of fun.
