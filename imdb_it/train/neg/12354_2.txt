Of course I didn't look at "GI Jane" by choice. I was more or less forced to watch this movie around my ex-girlfriend house. GIJ loses its credibility immediately trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario, which of course is not. The result is that the story automatically becomes constrained by constraints, which limit the amount of humor (of which there is none) or funny action scenes, and it soon becomes too serious. The film thus becomes extremely boring and predictable. <br /> <br /> 'GI Jane' fails where other action films succeed, mainly because films like James Bond, Dirty Harry and various others are bigger than life, yet they never claim to be otherwise I'm evasion, and therefore fun. 'GI Jane' tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing film by Ridley Scott, with a very unreliable plot, insignificant acting, and the only reason I give 2/10 instead of 1/10 is for some of the works technicians.
