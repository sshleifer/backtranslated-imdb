this is just the usual Indian garbage that is turned into cinema, as Indians can proudly boast of having the largest film industry, but also the worst. <br /> <br /> how can other poor countries have films with characters that defy the views of their respective companies and continue to pump waste. take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, watch the brilliant films they have and get bullshit like Kisna !! <br /> <br /> take real people, no wonder the international community generally laughs at India's cinema.
