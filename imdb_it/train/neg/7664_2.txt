Spoiler on, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a review of a movie made up entirely of questions? It could be? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why has this question never answered? Why was the opening text dragged inconsistently? Why a nun (she certainly looked nice!) Deliver more than 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine auctions come out in the courtyard of an orphanage? Why does the character of Tara Reid suddenly appear in Christian Slater's apartment by sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why even a non-archaeologist will mistake a precious solid gold bonnet with a club? Why do modern computers still show gray outlines of objects from the pre-Tron era, complete with small "beeps"? And all the explosive timers of all films have digital displays? Why does SOMETHING make any sense in this film?
