I rarely comment on the movies but I read the other comments and can't believe there are people applauding this celluloid junk. I know there are certain people who have their own agenda, but leave them on the merit; misinterpreted, badly shot and the story seemed that the director was making himself up as he was going forward. I will not focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving young children, since the creators of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is that it's a terrible film, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateur and I'm glad they can't make a film like this legally today
