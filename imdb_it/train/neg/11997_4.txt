this film has many negative aspects and this is all I could see. it's painfully long and terribly direct. I could see the whole audience becoming impatient and waiting for it to end. the execution time is over 3 hours which could have been changed in less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> the transition between stories is average. most people confessed to sitting down expecting something better to come out. <br /> <br /> it's fun only in the pockets. ambitious project and an execution below par. govinda does a good job, anil kapoor has disappointed me, I stay as planned. if you're expecting something close to babel or love, then it's not that close.
