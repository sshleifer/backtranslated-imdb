When I watched this year's Wrestlemania match card, I was so enthusiastic and unable to control myself because I was full of excitement. <br /> <br /> Start ... and finish. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting there, mad at hell as far as I wanted my money back. I mean, look at Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) that will go down like a classic and then you expect the same and you will get the average garbage they sometimes have. The only moment of the whole show that ruined it for me was when HBK came out! That moment when HBK loses to JOHN CENA !!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser / poser. He almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (thankfully). Once again I trust the WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen), which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. He certainly made up for "Mania 23" and gave us a lot of memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you looked at ANY from the Wrestleman before this, like those that turn you into a fan (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), PLEASE, don't look at this and make the same mistake I made leave the WWE behind. And if you look at him and you're angry, start looking at him again and look at Wrestlemania 24, it's absolutely classic.
