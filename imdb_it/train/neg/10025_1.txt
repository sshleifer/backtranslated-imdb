If this is a product of 2008 from one of the largest production companies of the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), I fear that it is very long for us to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong this way with such a large cast of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then the making of the film has yet to be studied much more by anyone associated with this film. The film is missing in almost all departments except cinematography and Akshay Kumar. It has few good dialogues to perform, but alone it cannot make you enjoy a movie with enormous expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car that descends into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon film. That itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Any actor who is otherwise a resource for a film is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's trick of trying good English falls almost every time. And Saif will surely be surprised to think why he signed this film. <br /> <br /> In short, THE LARGEST REFUSAL OF RESOURCES AFTER "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a more enjoyable film than this. <br /> <br /> It is not clear how and why this type of script was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the defective script, the weakest point of the film is his music. Vishal Shekhar gave only a few fill songs for each song. The songs start very well and suddenly the songs drop dramatically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good of all. An opportunity wasted by Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> As for the continuity intelligence of the producers, just take an example: Akshay and Saif are on the road in the hilly area of ​​a foreign position (probably the Ladakh). In the next scene they are searching for Kareena in Haridwar and then again in the hills with Kareena in their car cunt. I'm still thinking about who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you can sit up to the last, the climax is too long with stupid and useless stunts. You can see all the heroes who walk through the storm of bullets not injured as if they were GOD. Are we still seeing a 2008 film with all these technical heights reached? So no more words on this pathetic and downgrade movie, but a sincere request to the senior actors of their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, If possible, ask for a preview of your films after their first copy is out. As artists of this caliber, you have certain responsibilities towards your fans and your spectators. People still applaud as you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this type of film should not see the light of day as it hinders the reputation of everyone associated with the film, the actors and the production house both.
