This movie was on the air the other day and I didn't like it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel ... completely horrible. The new actor and actress who played the main roles were not good at all, they should have had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating, not a movies that you can sit and watch and have fun, this is a film that you turn to another channel or bring it back to the store if you hire or buy it. It was nice to see Ape, the monkey, but he wasn't as funny as the first, they should have had the new George as Georges grown son, and he still had Bredon and (what's his face) in the movie, that would be "I was a better bit then.
