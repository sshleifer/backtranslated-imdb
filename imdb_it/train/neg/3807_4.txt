Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of many Woody films, obviously his late 70s masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late 80s / early 90s plays ( Hannah, Crimes and Misdemeaners, Husbands and Wives) in fact I also liked some of his most recent efforts (Melinda, Anything Else, Small Time Crooks) but this was abysmal, although it couldn't have been worse than past years Match Point but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It was parted lazily - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes pulled out - even Woody seems to be about to go out, ruining most of his "hilarious" lines and transcriptions I mean "with all due respect ..." again and again until the simplicity of everything becomes very evident. <br /> <br /> I know that most of the actors queue up working with him but they should at least read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are much better than this - and Woody should really take a role behind the role of the camera in the future, if it makes sense about 20 miles behind it. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so tragic if we hadn't had so many great Woody films compare this with - but it's clear that his best days are behind him and, judging by this effort, Woody should call it a day before it becomes an industry joke. <br /> <br /> Embarrassingly bad
