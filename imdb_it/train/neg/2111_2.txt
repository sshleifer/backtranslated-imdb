"Bela Lugosi, in his role as European horticulturist (sic), in this extravagant tale of horror and dementia, bela Lugosi, the elderly wife of the good doctor needs fluids collected from the glands of young virgins to preserve her youth and beauty. "If the doctor keeps his escort rather than in the alter, where does he kidnap unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sitting them in a coma-like state, he takes them to his villa to collect his contaminated ammunition," according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. That brief description is much more fun and imaginative than the movie. <br /> <br /> ** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell
