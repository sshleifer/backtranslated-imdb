Claustrophobic camera angles that do not help the film: Only the shots where most of the time there is the feeling that the lower half of the film is missing (that the screen is cut) only too long, because there seem to be important actions underway , but you can't see them. However, there is too much confusion in the film, so these viewing angles make the situation worse and do not contribute to creating creative images. <br /> <br /> I like artfully made movies and unconventional camera work. I can handle deep and slow films. But this is trying too hard to be something artistic and fails in my opinion painfully. <br /> <br /> Nothing to attach to any of the characters, because they have not been processed well enough. To process the characters you need more, rather than taking minutes in the face, at least with this set of scripts + director + actors. <br /> <br /> I wonder if part of the acting not so good is due to the script and director or thanks to the actors. <br /> <br /> I will stay away from the films written and directed by Le You for sure in the future. <br /> <br /> What an annoying movie even for someone who would be interested in that part of the story, and for someone who spent time in Shanghai.
