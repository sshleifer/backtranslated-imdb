Somehow, a woman working with a scientist puts the metal balls in the mouths of the people who supposedly change their personality, but actually turns them into crazy zombie killers. The "guinea pigs" for the experiment are unmarried young women in a desperate need for acting lessons. This film is horrible, atrocious and incredibly bad. He has little or no logic in the script. You'll really have trouble following what's going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen that presumably represents enormous scientific progress seems nothing more than an old Atari screen. And what's worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair (looks like a lonely child at the summer camp) named George who is like a personal servant / confidant of Jessica (the main "actress"). During the film you will be subjected to the idiotic and supernatural statements of this puppet. But wait ... you also have a lot of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with girls with some bar guys. All the while a more annoying soundtrack is played in the background as a sort of spiritual discovery. None of the actors is good. There are only different degrees of bad. The gore and "horror" aspects are especially filmed. The film really looks like a teenager putting it together. It is no coincidence that Henry Sala, the director by name but not by profession, did not make another film. I was almost bored in a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! And how does it end? What happened? If you can let me talk about the secret because for the life of me I can't understand it. All I know is that I lost the time spent looking at this garbage that made the start of my weekend a real nightmare of boredom!
