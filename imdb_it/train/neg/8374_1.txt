What's the point of reviewing a movie like this? It's painfully and awkwardly ugly, not even in a way that lets you make fun of it. <br /> <br /> Movies like "Little Man" depress me. They represent the maximum throwaway film. This film was made for a group of 18-24 year-old Dipsh * t siblings that the studio hoped would come out and see it the night of the opening before news leaked about how bad it was, so the movie could recover quickly his investment. <br /> <br /> A hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't make their films because the resources were going to make this puddle of vomit. <br /> <br /> Vote: F
