I found this a good movie to pass the time, but not for any possibility of historical value. The portrait of Cleopatra reminded me of a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The twist is ... funny! He gave birth while he fed his people!?!? Or please ... A pregnant Queen of Egypt (especially this one) wouldn't bother going from room to room for that reason! They tried to make her look like a saint for God's sake! And the way they tried to justify his sister's murder ... beyond the description. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra was the greatest politician of her time. His decisions were based on everything but his feelings and morals. He did everything only for two reasons: power and self-preservation! She was born into a family where she had to fight for survival, something she did very well. Whatever was in his way was murdered (his brothers and sisters) or seduced (Cesare and Marco Antonio). Unfortunately, Octavian was too powerful to kill and even ... gay to seduce. So it was his end ...
