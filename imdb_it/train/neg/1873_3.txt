You MUST be kidding !!!! We admit the possibility that Parker Posey is really an actress, and not just a voice in the actors' club of the month club. Indeed, unless it is an ironic satire on David Mamet: a terse and confused dialogue delivered alternatively to the speed of the machine gun or to the monotony (think of Ben Stein) - or a flat and dry comedy; this film must be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award --- or worse. <br /> <br /> As if the stiff and uncomfortable Posey were not enough, we have the stiffest and most uncomfortable Jeff Goldblum. There is more wood in this film than a toothpick factory. <br /> <br /> In addition to this already bizarre casting, there are many other roles, all populated by forgettable actors, who seem or seem to be fleeing the American Next Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the child, who pronounces the word "state" as "bean", which only draws our attention to the fact that there is so little to love in this film, we are analyzing its accent to guess whether it is Canadian or not !! I think I laughed heartily in places that should be serious and I took seriously sections that are meant to be fun. The soundtrack also looks like a caricature of the music of Alarik Jans for "The House of Games" by Mamet. If taken as a parody, the film is almost funny; if taken seriously, just a piece of self-conscious drek.
