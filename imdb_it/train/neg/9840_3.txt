Eccentric, independent, theatrical, Christian Slater - these are all teasers that made me look forward to spending an hour or "discovering" a jewel in a movie. Boy, I was disappointed. Julian Po has never surpassed himself. The film is inexorably clumsy. I found myself unable to suspend disbelief even for a moment. Those exaggerated, obviously theatrical, exaggerated, obviously theatrical acting, exaggerated, obviously theatrical direction - well, you understand the idea. <br /> <br /> Allegories do not need to be delivered in club style. And it's hard to hear a lot of everything for Julian Po because we never know much about him. The ridiculous girl, the annoying villagers, the ecclesiastical idiot, the snotty kids - why would anyone, especially anyone with a long ambition to go to the beach (Slater's character), decide to stay in such a sad place?
