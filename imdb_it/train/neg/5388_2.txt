There's a good movie lurking here, but that's not it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that should face a group of young apocalypse survivors. But the logic is so confusing that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid in capturing the mysterious airborne contagion that has wiped out virtually all of humanity. Yet they wear surgical masks a few times, not others. Sometimes they are fanatics of bleaching any area touched by an infected person with bleach. Other times, they seem completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> Even worse, after apparently surviving a few weeks or months in this new world of killing or being killed, these people constantly behave like new novices. They do not bother to accumulate adequate equipment or food. They are running out of fuel forever in the middle of nowhere. They do not take elementary precautions when they encounter strangers. And after going through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they are squeamish as protected beginners. You constantly have to ask how they could have survived so long ... and even if they did, because someone would like to make a film about them. <br /> <br /> So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take soul searching seriously. Their actions should first have some sort of a minimum sense. <br /> <br /> Besides all this, we have to deal with the questionable acting skills of Chris Pine. His portrait of an arrogant young James T Kirk could have seemed cunning, if seen in isolation. But in Carriers it sounds exactly the same note: arrogant and head of bones. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film * looks * excellent. It has an over-sharp and saturated appearance that really fits into the southwestern United States. But this cannot save the really weak writing or the thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the end of the world genre, you should save yourself from the agony of watching carriers.
