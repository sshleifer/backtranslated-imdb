This is the only question I have left. Why did this film suck so much when it had such an exceptional cast? Why was the writing so bad, left the audience completely disconnected from the characters? Why didn't it make any sense? Why did the studio take a perfect premise and "Hollywood" leave when all it needed was a beautiful and intelligent story? Why? I never understand why start-up movies turn into a bunch of crap when they are released. I hope for Freeman and Spacey, who are Oscar WINNERS, that this will never be released on the big screens in America. <br /> <br /> As someone who has a degree in journalism, the whole story is just absolutely ridiculous. I ... I think the script has potential, but the execution turned it into a clich√© and a terrible one. As soon as. No.
