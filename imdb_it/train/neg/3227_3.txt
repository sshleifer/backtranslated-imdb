This is an episode of the infamous Guinea Pig series. A short-lived Japanese TV show, which was canceled after a psychopath admitted he was inspired by the killing of a young student from the show. This short of the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without history. A group of boys caught a young woman. They tie her up and continue to torture her to death while they film her. They beat her, pour boiling oil, use tongs and finally, in the "loving" first floor, they pass a needle through her eyes. This is the simplest of all the films on Guinea Pig and one of the first. Probably this film, more than any other, gave Guinea Pig the voice of being tobacco. They certainly inspired Nicolas Cage's "8 mm" film. These films have become very popular in horror circles. They switched to more refined, but equally graphic films like "Naked Blood". They probably fill the void left by Mondo's films, which has been lightly cleaned up and become TV reality. Not recommended, but I will probably attract those who see something once, and wonder why, afterwards, I know I did it.
