This film looked promising, but actually it was pretty ugly. The premise was O.K, but the plot itself was terrible. The actors did their best with limited material, but could not overcome the pettiness of this college film. Jason Schwartzman was again extremely irritating - even more than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast was not quite eventful. The scenes that should have been fun turned out to be daunting and incredibly youthful. Try to be a Road Trip / American Pie but it fails immoderately at all levels. A total waste of everyone's time.
