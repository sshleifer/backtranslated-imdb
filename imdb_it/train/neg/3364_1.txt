So start with a beautiful old house in the countryside. You have a group of people who are invited to come to this house and (not surprisingly) the keepers always close the gates at night for no apparent reason. Anywhoo, people laugh, joke etc. This Dr tells them a spooky story about this woman and some children. They get scared, they start to feel things. Oh no, a girl sees her ghost. Still a little talk about this huge ghost, etc. Etc. This girl discovers that this ghost has killed small children and that she must free their souls, yes yes, blah blah. He does it but, oh no, he dies like her. And he goes to heaven while this evil ghost goes to hell. Two people survive and escape the house. The script is terrible because a boy is severed his head and Elanor (the one who dies saving the children) says "oh no". The acting is wood, the effects are disgusting and the set is a couple of rooms used over and over again. Basically if you like to laugh at badly made movies look at it, but if you're looking for a scare, then surely you lose this movie. I was extremely disappointed when I saw this. A big disappointment. My sister (who is sacred very easily) is bored in this film which is scary.
