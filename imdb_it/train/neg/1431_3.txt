!!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! <br /> <br /> You would think that a story involving Archie Gray Owl - An Englishman posing as a red Indian - would involve a huge amount of humor. In fact, I would say that the only way to treat a film like this in which an extraordinary man is the gullible public is to treat it like a comedy. However, Richard Attenborough commits something like a crime making GRAY OWL a serious drama. Worse, he also made an extremely terrible film. Pierce Brosnan does not have the charisma necessary for the role of the protagonist and the romantic subplot between Gray Owl and Pony (played by the wooden anchor Annie Gaupeau) lacks any kind of on-screen chemistry. But to be honest with the cast they were not helped with the script that fails to portray Archie as the cheeky chappy he is able to fool everyone into believing that he is a native American. The producers and screenwriter have made the main mistake of having the center of the film around the twists of Archie who is an Englishman - That's why I wrote "Possible spoiler" is not revealed until later in the movie than the title character it is English, but it is obvious that everyone who has seen this film knew it beforehand, so there is absolutely no surprise. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first major environmentalist of the 20th century had he been told. And it must also be remembered that, with the exception of the VERDE SOFFIENTE (and perhaps LE DUE TORRI if you want to classify it as having a green message) that was not really a great ecological film. In fact, most environmentally conscious films suck and this includes GRAY OWL, a film that surprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor
