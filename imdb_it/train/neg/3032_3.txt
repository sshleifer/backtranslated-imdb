Someone told me that this was one of the best adult films to date. Since then I have discredited everything I was told by this individual after watching this movie. It's just terrible. Without going into the long descriptions of the various scenes, trust me on the word, sex scenes are not interesting. Jenna in normal street clothes at the beginning was the highlight of the movie (looks good) but it's all downhill from there.
