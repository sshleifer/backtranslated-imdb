This film features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The credits and start credits show along with most of the actors and "special effects" that this is a low-budget film. There is nothing in this film that you could not find in other crazy scientists, horror / comedy or low budget films. Nothing special for lovers of the naked scene or lovers of bad movies. This film is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about. If you are curious how I was and you can find it, you will realize the truth of the summary of a line.
