I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, which I hadn't seen in any Rocky IV movie. Unfortunately this film was a big disappointment. The acting of all the parts was bad, except for Mr. Lundgren, who agreed. Kata Dob√≥ was something nice to look at despite her ridiculous dress and makeup. <br /> <br /> The plot is not smart at all, it's something that has been repeated a million times in different movies. The criminals were completely stereotyped and the character of Lundgren had no depth. I didn't really expect a masterpiece of the film, but unfortunately it's not even a decent action. Every turn in the plot is extremely predictable and the incredible amount of unrealism and characters similar to comics started to annoy me very soon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to kids who want something comic action, but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I suppose the current average rating of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in making this film)
