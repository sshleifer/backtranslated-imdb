This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - surpassing the previous most incredible film, "Spawn of Slithis", which I saw when I was about 10 years old. <br /> <br /> Bad, reciting, pungent and ridiculous dialogues, an incomprehensible plot, mixed scenes, even the music was annoying. Did I leave something? Well, the special effects weren't bad - but CGI doesn't make a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe I spent money to watch this movie. If anyone has contact information for Hyung-rae Shim (the director), please forward it to my username "to gmail" and I will contact him to request a refund.
