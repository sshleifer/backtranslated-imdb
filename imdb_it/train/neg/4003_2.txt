A big disappointment. This was one of the best theatrical / detective shows in the United Kingdom in the 1990s that developed the fascinating title character played by Scottish champion Robbie Coltrane. However, this one-off has little to add and perhaps suffers from an inevitable disappointment due to the expectations raised when a favorite show returns after a long break. A Coltrane is not given much to do, much more attention is given to the uninteresting murderer, and in that in which he must act, he seems uninvolved, almost bored. The story of the ex-soldier is written from books and the attempt to update ourselves on Coltrane's family life seems light. Perhaps if the writers had an entire series in front of them instead of a single two-hour show, they would have written this with much more depth. As it is, skip this and look at the old 90s Cracker which is far superior.
