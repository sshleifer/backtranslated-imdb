DOWN TO EARTH / (2001) * (out of four) <br /> by Blake French: <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" is a comedy so misleading and desperate that it sits at the sofa watching a comic act on Chris Rock's TV looks like heaven. Speaking of heaven, the film is based on the 1978 film "Heaven Can Wait." That was a good movie, and that's nice, to show how a group of aspiring screenwriters can take decent material and turn it into garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz miss almost all targets. From conception to narration, "Down to Earth" fails miserably; this is an incredibly bad production. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock is a crazy comedian, both in his role in this film and in real life. He plays Lance Barton, whose manager, (Frankie Faison), even feels sorry for him when he is booed off the stage during an amateur evening at a local theater. Shortly after the script establishes his lack of talent, the character is killed by a racing truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made a mistake, taking Lance before his number expired. God's assistant (Chazz Palminteri) is very angry and decides to let Lance compose the rest of his time on Earth, as long as he takes the only available body of a 60-year-old white millionaire. <br /> <br /> the old man is called Wellington, whose life has his problems. His wife (Jennifer Coolidge) has a relationship with his assistant (Greg Germann), who is robbing him of his money. But it's okay because Lance, inside Mr. Wellington, fell in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King.) Meanwhile, there are plots to kill Wellington, Lance trying to get a better body and Sonee confuses feelings with a hospital situation that involves Mr. Wellington's finances. <br /> <br /> "Down to Earth" has some good ideas, but they find themselves in a useless and unconvincing love story full of tricks and recycled material. The biggest problem he encounters is the way we perceive Lance as Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is the actor with popularity and publicity, so he won't be absent from most of this movie; all the characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. This is convenient for the romance; we believe that a young woman would fall in love with Lance, but in reality, in reality, she is an old gray-haired idiot. It is not so convincing. <br /> <br /> The comic situation of the one-line comic strip should look at an old man who does funny things that are really done by a young black man. But what inspires laughter is when the characters run into conflicts without their knowledge. Just look at "There's something about Mary". In funny scenes the characters are exposed to embarrassing experiences and not to their liking. Here, Lance knows he is in the body of an old man and does things that old people would not normally do. If Lance didn't know the body he was in then he could have potential. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the concept: we never met Mr. Wellington in the first place, so how can we compare Lance in his body when we don't know how it was originally. To top it all, Chris Rock must be the center of attention here, and it makes the character too similar to Rock. Read simple routine jokes that are boring and painful; his dialogue is so obvious, wooden and direct. I hated the film's sense of humor. There are so many funny little jokes and horrible comic situations. It's like watching Chris Rock be Chris Rock, not a movie character. <br /> <br /> We emphasize the positive aspects of "Down to Earth". Mark Addy does nothing worse than he did in "The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas". Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari are wealthy, but they are at the mercy of a scalped script. These are all the good qualities I can mention right now, and if you give me another week to remember, it is not likely that I will ever leave it again.
