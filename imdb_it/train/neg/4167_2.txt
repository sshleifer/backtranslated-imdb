I was looking forward to seeing "Mr. Fix It" because I'm a big fan of David Boreanaz. What I got, however, was a 1-1 / 2 hour nap. The premise seemed pleasant: Boreanaz is Lance Valenteen, owner of a business called "Mr. Fix It", where disused men enlist his help to convince their girlfriends to take them back. <br /> <br /> Among the problems with this the film is editing, screenplay and acting. Although I found Boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that "Crow" movie he did), this was disappointing. Sometimes, his character was interesting and other, flat. The supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. I realize that it wasn't a high-budget film, but some of the cuts and music on the scene didn't seem right. <br /> <br /> My advice: look at your own risk.
