Every so often, Disney makes one of the films that surprises everyone. One that makes you wonder until the end. In the tradition of Pirates of the Caribbean, this film will surely become a ghost and will kill and rape your village. It's terrible. If you want a senseless, meaningless and predictable "action" movie, go ahead. I think young children can appreciate this, they like it when they ALWAYS win Good. But I like movies where it's a mess that will win. This film never makes bad guys prevail. In the end, when the heroes are left in an "ineluctable" pit, simply SAPPI that can exit. Everything works perfectly for Cage and his friends, he must never think of a riddle or a clue for more than 10 seconds, no matter how complex. Watch this movie if you want to see some awesome sets, not if you want to see good acting or a good movie. Go watch a superman movie, it would be much shorter, and kids would like more. For example, the scene in which Cage is escaping from armed gunmen, and the bullets are all diverted from a balustrade of a fire escape. (And I'm not talking about a fence or anything, just a LITTLE POINT) This film shows the decadence of films and the film industry with cheap gags and boring and unrealistic actions, which this film offers in large quantities.
