This movie is so bad it hurts. The car is 30 mph when it should go to 100 ... the gear lever that is locked (in the park!), The nurse who drives for almost 2 hours with the mobile on the shoulder ... none of the 2 is possible idiots take this damn phone? There is nothing credible in this shit. I would be ashamed of being seen in a movie like this!
