Maybe I couldn't find the DVD menu selection for PLOT: ON OFF. Clearly, the default value is OFF. When the credits began to spin, I couldn't believe it was so. Like our poor but beautiful protagonist, I felt used, dirty, cheap ... <br /> <br /> The characters were drawn with very wide strokes and the writer's contempt for the rich Thatcheriti was obvious. I consider myself a "democratic Roosevelt", but I would appreciate the subtlety a little more. <br /> <br /> Of course, the problem could be with me. I see that many others seem to find a meaning or a message in this image. Alas, not me. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from giving this "1" was the beautiful landscape, human and plant.
