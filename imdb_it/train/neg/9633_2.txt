Is Elizabeth Taylor rich, sickly, courting the Angel of Death in her island fortress in the Mediterranean, or is she just overreacting - or, more precisely, exaggerating - as usual? In fact, both are applicable in the vagabond and vagabond chaos of director Joseph Losey, called "Boom", appropriately named because souls in a lush and luxurious environment are almost ready to explode. Richard Burton climbs Taylor's mountain without being invited; she dresses him in a samurai robe complete with saber. Although it is of great visual impact, the image is quite deadly, a failure that even Liz 'n Dick-philes should avoid (the collective attitude of the stars what the hell!) To their cinematographic career of the late 60s has reached a ego-crazy nadir here). Useless, confused and maddening, "Boom" is a catastrophe - even though screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who adapted his drama without success "The milk train does not stop there any longer", it was said that he liked it very much! * from ****
