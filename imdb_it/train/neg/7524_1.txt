A handful of critics awarded this film with positive comments. I don't want to argue with their opinion, but I strongly disagree. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was pleasantly impressed. But after comparing it with other films, in particular with the late master, Bruce Lee, I immediately changed my mind. In fact, if it wasn't for the film's title, I would never have bought it. Game of Death 2 does not refer to the original Game of Death (except that it shares a character, Billy Lo.) <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see how similar Game of Death 2 has been compared to Enter the Dragon. The plots have striking similarities: both Bruce Lee and Bobby Lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. The two positions are similar, in which both are very isolated and surrounded by thousands of Blackbelts. There is an element of prostitution in both films (women send two guest rooms in both films). Both Han (Enter the Dragon) and Lewis's henchman have a missing hand. Theirs is an underground drug operation in Enter the Dragon, believe it or not, there is one in Game of Death 2. Han has a domestic cat in Enter the Dragon, the director used his imagination and has awarded Lewis with a monkey! The list continues. <br /> <br /> Regarding other aspects of the film, such as the script and the acting, I felt that he was very poor. It seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to act in the film and pray that they could act. <br /> <br /> On a positive scale, I can't deny that the choreography is impressive. Although the combat sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are nevertheless executed with skill. However, since the plot is insufficient, I could not refer to the characters, so the fighting sequences were more exhibits than having a meaning for the film. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say that this film is to be recommended to all martial arts fans, but for those who like a solid action film, with a good storyline and strong characters, I would not seriously recommend this movie . My opinions on this film may seem very partial and one-sided, but when Bruce Lee set a new standard in martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: Enter the Dragon, this film failed to reach these standards. If anything they imitated a really brilliant martial arts film, hoping to reach the same level of fame. <br /> <br /> Referring to my assessment, assigning a very tough 1 in 10 movie, the film is watchable barley, and I must be grateful that it had the combat sequences it did.
