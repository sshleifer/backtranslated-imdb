This film is exaggerated, predictable, pretentious and empty in its core. The settings are faithful at the time but aware of their magnification thanks to prolonged exposure. Persistent artifacts stop action and almost close as empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking like Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give depth to a character just by making your face white! The content does not justify the histrionic acting of Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb case.
