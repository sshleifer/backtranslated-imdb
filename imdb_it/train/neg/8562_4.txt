CAMILLE 2000 <br /> <br /> Format: 2.35: 1 (Panavision) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> During a visit to Rome, a loving nobleman ( Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romanticism is contrasted by the rich father of Castelnuovo (Massimo Serato), and fate faces a tragic blow ... <br /> <br /> A love story in love for swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas "La Dame aux Camelias") by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed by freewheeling momentum by Radley Metzger who, along with Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is accredited with the redefinition of the "adult" cinema parameters in the 60s and 70s. Using the optical format for the last time in his career, the exploration of Metz's "sweet life" is full of visual excesses (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), although the sexual whiteness of the film seems alarming by modern standards. Production values ​​are beautiful everywhere, and performances are engaging and human (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite the weak post-sync dubbing. Although set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's extravagant sets identify the film firmly in his period, and Piero Piccioni's "wah-wah" soundtrack has become a sort of cult object among exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant soft erotica will not be disappointed. Next for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.
