The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later published on video / DVD as a feature film) on the treacherous 60s, seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is driven by Dutton's excellent performance as Reverend Willie Taylor and spreads the plot evenly between families. However, Dutton's character is half-killed and the black family is completely forgotten in a boring, inconsistent and completely terrifying second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not classified (later classified as PG-13 for the video / DVD version).
