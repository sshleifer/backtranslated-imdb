If I could say that it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt that my money wasn't totally wasted. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Steven Segal's On Deadly Ground. <br /> <br /> This film should see a resurrection however on MST 3K. If Santa conquers the Martians he could blow up Tom Servo's head, wondering what this movie could cause. <br /> <br /> There is a good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a film career. <br /> <The writers of this dreck should be forced to wear signs every day of their lives that say "Bitch slaps me! I was a writer on Gymkata".
