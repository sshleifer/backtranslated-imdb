This film was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes I'm used to seeing. But that doesn't change the fact that a plot is totally missing. I'm sure there are many gays who are happy to see themselves portrayed on the screen, since they rarely see black gay characters, and when they are characters they are usually not fully developed. But how difficult it would have been for the writer to write a story with a beginning, a central part and an end. Or how about a focused story. It seems that there is not really a point in this film, and even if it is a low budget film, it is not yet an excuse for the lack of history or plot.
