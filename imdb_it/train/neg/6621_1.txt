Something somewhere must have gone terribly wrong just when the director was sensing this plot. The film, which should have been a remake of one of the most beloved films in the cinema, fails to provide all aspects of filmmaking. The best of the artists might not even understand the tuning, which simply continues to show that the film itself was a serious mistake. <br /> <br /> Assembly is poor. Direction is crap. Acting is out of this world (omg)! The characters that should look scary force people to laugh at the stupidity of their dialogues and customs. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the ticket price or even gave me a free hamburger with it.
