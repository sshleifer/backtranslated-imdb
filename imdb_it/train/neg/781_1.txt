This show was absolutely terrible. For one, George is not funny, and his children are little snobbish kids. He also treats his mother without respect. Being Hispanic, I am very offended by this show and the way the characters are represented. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the dysfunctional family was killed. For once, I want to see something original. What makes this show fun when other shows have done it millions of times? I thought the ABC would be back in fashion and would have excluded this piece of rubbish, but unfortunately we will have to endure it until we "jump the shark". <br /> <br /> In my opinion, they have already done it.
