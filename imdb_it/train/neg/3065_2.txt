This film represents the times when it was made as much as the original, I suppose. Which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the original "Vanishing Point" title is so ironic. I'm sure it wasn't designed that way, but the original was shot in 1970 and published in 1971. The TRUE "EMPTY POINT" was the end of an era that ended practically in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> In this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been ripped off, and have been made more PCs in an attempt to reach a wider audience, presumably. "Sanitized for your protection" <br /> <br /> The inclusion of the American Indian scenes was free and the idea of ​​a "noble purpose" for the journey was the addition by addition. I'm glad I saw it anyway, it made me appreciate the original much more. The original is a classic of worship and gold. This remake is terrible.
