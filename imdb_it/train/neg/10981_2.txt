Or listening, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is boring. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I've ever seen (which would be Regarding Billy), but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is unheard - it could have worked in the hands of a good writer. . . certainly could have been a lot more fun. There is no point in the plot that you can't see coming ten miles up the road. Dialogue is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional and stereotypical gays. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film convinced me that the situation or the relationship between the two protagonists was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamics, in fact no proof of why the protagonists love each other. . . they just told us they are in love. Difficult to understand when they have nothing in common and are not sexually compatible. Do they like the same book? Eh? <br /> <br /> The acting is not entirely negative, but the pace is tremendously slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch - slow, but without the quality of Jarmusch. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch movies, avoid this.
