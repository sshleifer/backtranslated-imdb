I saw this movie at his premiere at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Since American Beauty is a film that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless films I've seen in nearly a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance film I've ever wanted to get out of early. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with Towelhead is that it obviously originates from a collection of "provocative" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than from an organic human drama. The script derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. I am reminded of the famous quote by Edith Wharton: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good despite being adapted to the political opinions of the author. This observation is particularly devastating for Towelhead because his political views are so refined and simplistic. If ever there was a time when the evil white men of Towelhead, condescending portraits of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., They were fresh, it's been a long time. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please look at one of the many professional reviews available online. Almost everyone misjudges this film and expose the superficial and manipulative tissue on which it is based. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur reviewers seem more easily confused. Reading the reviews of this and other similar sites, you will often encounter superlatives: "stunning", "breathtaking", "deep", "shocking" ... I am embarrassed to read them, but it does not surprise me. In fact, I met many people who seem to consider any book or film that deals with racial, cultural, gender or sexual issues as deeply moving, stimulating, full of deep insight. If you are such a person, by all means, rent Towelhead and be moved by it. On the other hand, if you set your highest standards, you can safely pass this.
