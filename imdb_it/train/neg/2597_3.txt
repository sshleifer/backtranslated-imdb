Drew Barrymore is an actress who has gone through difficult times, not only in her career, but also in her personal life. After being a child prodigy actress, she ended up in darkness with low quality mediocre films. While recovering from that dark past, this film remains a reminder of Drew Barrymore's worst days. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting premise, very similar to "Raising Cain" by Brian De Palma; with a plot that addresses the multiple personality disorder that defines the plot of a horror / thriller. Barrymore plays Holly Gooding, a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event in her past in which her other personality apparently killed her mother. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, her past returns to torment her as her evil personality returns to her life willing to ruin her new-found peace and her new found love. In the midst of chaos, her new boyfriend, Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), will try to help Holly face the demons of her past. <br /> <br /> Unlike the underrated thriller by De Palma, "Doppelganger" is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills its purpose, but also ends in one of the worst endings in the history of the cinema. While Barrymore is definitely not at his best, he manages to maintain his dignity with an above-average performance. The rest of the cast goes from mediocre to painfully exaggerated performances, although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best. <br /> <br /> The script is full of clich√©s and De Palma's influence is quite obvious. While the film tries to be original by making literary references in almost all the lines, the dialogues are boring and the wooden acting is certainly not good. He has a good dose of nudity and for strange reasons, and an excessive use of special effects. <br /> <br /> The make-up effects are made from the extraordinary KNB and are really among the few positive things in the film. However, the bizarre excessive use of effects in the totally out-of-context end decreases the impact of KNB's work and makes what is amazing in a different film fantastic. <br /> <br /> The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for its low quality, as with a better and more coherent script this could have been an interesting film. Unfortunately, everything we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second. Worthy of Barrymore's beauty. 3/10
