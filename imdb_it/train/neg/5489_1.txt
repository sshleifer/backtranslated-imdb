The story is similar to ET: an extraterrestrial race on earth and tries to go home. While remaining on our planet, it will create friendly ties with humans. <br /> <br /> But, unlike ET which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this film is just fun. It is in fact a pure Dysney production: its basic audience is children and the film is more in the vision than in the message. <br /> <br /> So, you will find some funny scenes (the first sighting of the city, a "cosmic" toaster) and the casting is tested, with special mentions to "Doc", which rejuvenates in a "Mac Fly" , and to Hurley, who seems open to self-determination. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: the main title is marked by Danny Elfman, and like any other great composer, he recognizes his "voice" even before being credited.
