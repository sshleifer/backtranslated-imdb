Cameron Diaz is a married woman with a judge, played by Harvey Keitel, whose life goes well until a former man shows up and things get complicated. While watching this movie there were several times I wondered why I was doing so ... because the film is so ridiculous and blah and badly scripted without any credibility. Nor is the public really able to guide what is happening ... Even the beautiful Cameron cannot save this on a scale of one to ten.2
