This film moves down from the 4th to the 1st without worrying about the 3rd or 2nd, with straight gears up to the b-movie finishing line. The cone at the beginning is easily the best and most intelligent part of the film. It is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so quickly, you may not notice it. It is certainly not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his introduction to TCM to this bad-mediocre confusion. There is no real conflict, and all the characters in this supposed marginal society turn out to be holy, especially the incredible character, Al. I wonder if he has a job for me in Cincinnati?
