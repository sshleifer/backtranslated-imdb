I'm among the millions who consider themselves fans of Cary Grant, but I can't think of a single reason to recommend this film. I don't understand the cast of Betsy Drake and it seems that nobody else has done it, if we want to Judge by the small number of films in which he has acted later. <br /> <br /> Most fans agree that Katharine Hepburn was very good at chasing and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby. Here the director or writers try to rework the idea, but fails miserably. I read comments about how "gruesome" Drake was, but I thought it was too mild a description. Franchot Tone went through this as if he were a hungover. A catastrophe is one thing. This film is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This does not deserve 10 lines of comments and I don't know why this is a requirement. Unfortunately this has been preserved when so many noteworthy films deteriorate in the vaults. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to torture someone, give it a go.
