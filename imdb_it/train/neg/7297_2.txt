From the dialog box and the opening scenes, I knew I was in a train accident. I didn't want to look, but he couldn't turn his back. If it hadn't been for the most beautiful eyes in this film, I would have given it a star. The fact that the interaction between the characters and the relational behavior was so far-fetched, added by bad direction and a horrible story, makes this film nothing but a low-budget disaster. Money is definitely not a necessity to make a good movie. But this film fails so horribly that there is no chance of bouncing. <br /> <br /> If you were stuck in the woods, your best childhood friend dies of an unknown disease, other friends who die around you, stuck in a strange place, what would you do? <br /> <br /> A.) Escape from everyone and try your luck alone. B.) Have sex with your girlfriend of friends. C.) Take a warm bath to relax your pain including shaving your legs. D.) Bash your best childhood friend in the head and cooked for life with a shovel. E.) All of the above. <br /> <br /> According to Eli Roth, none of these answers is so far-fetched. In fact, everyone is plausible and well represented in Cabin Fever. The total lack of reality and the illogical attempt to explain what people would do in traumatic situations throws this film into the trash bin in your local rental store. Stay away. Stay away.
