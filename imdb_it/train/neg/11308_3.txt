<br /> <br /> Bring out your skittles and enjoy this imperfect action movie. The considerable kempo skill of Speakman (nice spinning kicks, decent with sticks - poor couch!) Is the only saving quality of a film that cries only bad acting. The plot is not bad bad; just run pretty bad. But if you're watching this movie for something other than martial arts, you miss the boat completely. And for a film that should take place in Koreatown, too few Korean actors (even extra).
