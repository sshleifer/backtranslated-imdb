Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Burial Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci. Now with this mix of great talent you would think that this film would have been a real gore festival. This could not be further from that. The massacre falls straight on his face as one of the most boring films I've ever seen come out of Italian cinema. Actually I was struggling to stay awake during the film and I never had that problem with Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Massacre begins with a prostitute who is slaughtered by the roadside with an ax. This scene was used in the Concerto of the Nightmare of Fulci. This is not a bad scene and raises your expectations of the film as an ax-wielding massacre. Unfortunately, the next hour of the film is so boring. The film continues with a series of horror films in progress and there's a lot of character development during all these scenes, but the characters in the film are so dull and misinterpreted that your interest starts to fade. The last 30 minutes of the film are not so bad, but they could have been much better. The gore in the film was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here. The end of the film left a nice turn, but there was still a lot of unanswered and continuity falls through the floor. <br /> <br /> It was not a very good film, but for a true Italian horror fan (like me) this film is a must since it is very rare. 4/10 stars
