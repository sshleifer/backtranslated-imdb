Being a big fan of "other" PLANET OF THE APES movies, I rented this DVD despite my dislike of everything about Tim Burton. Once again, he does not fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the monkey trick looks second-hand, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS were not enough proof). I was embarrassed for real talents like Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. There is no doubt that their salaries motivated them since it could not have been the clich√© script. I rented this DVD for a special $ 1 night and I still feel ripped off.
