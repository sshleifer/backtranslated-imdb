I like Goldie Hawn and I wanted another one of his films, so when I saw Protocol for $ 5.50 at Walmart I bought it. Although slightly funny, the film has never been a success. Some scenes like a party scene in a bar go on too long and have no purpose. <br /> <br /> So, of course, there is the preaching scene at the end of the film that gives the whole film a bad taste for me. I don't think this scene was added to the film. I don't like the stupid comedies that try to teach me a lesson, written in some 60s in particular! <br /> <br /> In the end, even though I'm happy to own another Hawn movie, I'm not sure it was really worth the money I paid for it!
