This film was fantastic the first time I saw it, when it was called "Lost in Translation". But somehow Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man played by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson transformed into an irritable Latin woman played by Paz Vega, and Tokyo, Japan, turned into Carson, California. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence that we enjoyed in Translation, we get a senseless blabber in 10 articles that border on annoying. Instead of thoughtful and introspective characters like in Translation, we get characters that send useless advice on topics they have no idea. How can a character who wears hundred-dollar shirts and who has never been inside a Target department store expect to advise a working-class woman on how to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? Don't think that you stop it. If he is not giving his advice on clothes, he is telling her what he should eat. The most annoying part of the film for me was how presumably they were in a hurry to make an appointment, yet the characters continue to find time to perform another commission, whether you wash the car, stop at Arby's, or just be removing from the list from their 10 articles or less lists of things they love and hate. I kept yelling at them saying, "Didn't you say you had a place to stay? What the hell are you doing? A minute ago you were pretty late, now you're eating roast beef and meditating on your lives!" Until I saw this film, I never really understood how something can "insist on itself", but I think this film does exactly that, and undeservedly. The dialogue makes the characters silly and unpopular with the exception that I felt sorry for both actors for having signed this project.
