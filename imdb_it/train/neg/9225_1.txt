CQ could have been good, campy fun. But he commits the only unforgivable sin: he is b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is deadly slow and the plot is quite confusing and so artificial that it's almost impossible to worry about where it's going. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing lesson from a careful and sensitive elementary, but this video should have contained a warning label: "ATTENTION: film for students, suitable for viewing only to relatives of the director".
