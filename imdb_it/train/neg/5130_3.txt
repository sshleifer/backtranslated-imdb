Janeane Garofalo has been very publicly sorry for this film, calling it, among other things, anti-feminist. He also said in his radio program that he hates doing "romantic comedies" because he doesn't believe it. I fully agree with Janeane here. This film is a bit useless. He does his best, but overall, it was just another boring, incredible "romantic comedy" that has no real-world basis. While there will be someone who will say "suspend your disbelief", you get tired of having to suspend it almost every time you get a romantic movie from Hollywood. Janeane's character, for some reason, is usually filmed in shadows and darkness, which makes it unattractive, while Uma's character is filmed in lighter tones (which probably displeased Janeane and is probably one of the reasons for which he hates this film). This really hurts the movie if we want to buy the premise that Janeane should be the better of the two. As many have said here and on other comment threads, Janeane is not ugly, but in reality she is very beautiful. I did not read a review in which someone said that Uma was more beautiful. That being said, I think the character of Ben Chaplin would more than likely stay with Uma, not with Janeane. Many men don't like really smart women (and many women don't like really smart men) and, unfortunately, Ben probably would have stayed with Uma. And despite the director's attempt to make Janeane attractive, it doesn't work. Its natural beauty nevertheless arrives. <br /> <br /> I think that many male Janeane fans are obsessed with her like this movie because they like to think of themselves in the character of Ben Chaplin and actually score with Janeane. Janeane is much more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is always much more complex than Hollywood can imagine), so take a cold shower. This is the role for which Janeane is best known, and it is a pity, because this is not the beauty of a movie.
