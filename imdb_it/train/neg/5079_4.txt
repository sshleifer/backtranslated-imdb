What a great actor to have in such a horrible story ... <br /> <br /> The film and its production, however, is quite good, even if set in London but with exteriors in Bristol. It does not matter ?? see a cathedral, you've seen them all, a kind of. <br /> <br /> But history ... speaks of a man born with the power to cause death and destruction on anyone and anything, he should desire. With a simple reference to the true instances of life of telekinesis, the narrative constructs the image of a man abused and badly judged as a boy, as a teenager and finally as a man; so much, in fact, that it demands revenge at will, literally. Over time, do you come to the conclusion that the whole world is heading the wrong way and then proposes to destroy the lot? just thinking about it! <br /> <br /> The problem with fiction, however, is that it tries to mix genuine scientific data on strange mental powers and merge everything with quasi-religious claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory on everything. Mixing facts and fantasy in this way rarely works ?? and I fear that Richard Burton had to forcefully react on some occasion trying to sound convincing. His best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and lover a verbal record while they were leaving his house: a sharp, witty and lethal dialogue, delivered as only Burton could. <br /> <br /> A good supporting cast helps make things seem much more beautiful, starting with Lino Ventura, whom I saw for the last time in Garde A Vu (1981), as inspector Brunel; Harry Andrews as deputy commissioner; the very underrated Lee Remick as Dr Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as editor, Towney, and some other well-known characters. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented, as a flashback in the flashback to fill in the backstory and then solve the immediate mystery of Morlar's (Richard Burton) attempted murder with the arrangement killer. Until then, it was a good job as a visual detective for Brunel and his English companion. Still, it was very predictable because it immediately became obvious to me about the identity of the would-be murderer. Then they went to ruin everything in the last fifteen minutes. If you want to have a clue as to what it is, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), the illustrious Cecil B. de Mille, and eventually Samson took the bad guys. And, the last scene is simply stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar's fury could have been stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Too bad, actually, because it could have been a much better story and film. I guess Burton really needed money. <br /> <br /> If you are a Burton fan, then pass the time to see that scene that I mentioned above. Otherwise, don't worry.
