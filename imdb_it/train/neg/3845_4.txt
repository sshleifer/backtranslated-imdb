Although Bette Davis did a WONDERFUL job like Mildred, I felt that the movie was not the best I had seen. At the end of the film I felt like there was something missing. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a perfect job though, and made me hate and pity all the time. Leslie Howard was as good as the lover Philip Carey, and I always pitied him for being in love with such a horrible lady. It's such a sad thing when you find yourself in love with a bad seed. And above all if it is someone like Philp Carey, who is a sensitive person, even if pathetic. <br /> <br /> In the end, acting was what came through and not the plot. The final scene was particularly good, but I'm not one to give it away. Although others may find this film good, I found it so well. I should recommend this film to those who like a bad seed, so they can see what can happen to them if they find themselves in love with that horrible person.
