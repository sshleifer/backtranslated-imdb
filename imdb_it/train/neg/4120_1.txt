Absolutely awful movie. Ameteurish and not at all funny. The main character played by Mehmet Ali Erbil is very annoying. The changes to E.T and Star Wars are simply stupid. <br /> <br /> Actor Yilmaz Goksal is the only one who thinks well of this film. He should master his English and move to Hollywood. Hollywood can't find an actor with his qualities. In addition to Goksal, this film is rubbish. <br /> <br /> Director Gani Mujde is a comic book writer and this film is his worst work written to date. <br /> <br /> Cem Karaca's music is another one besides this waste of money. Even the actor Sumer Tilmac has a certain presence. The actor who plays the three children has no talent as ever.
