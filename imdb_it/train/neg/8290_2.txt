Alan Rudolph is such a director without that special touch. For example, there was a shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office that could have expressed the entire relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph squandered it. The camera is in the corridor that looks through the doors of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave alone in their respective rooms. You have the idea of ​​their desolation and isolation, but not much more. Lighting, colors, body language, facial expressions could have been vastly improved. If I headed, I would spend all day, if necessary, to get that shot right. This is the beauty and power of the film: it can express so many, whole lives, in a matter of seconds <br /> <br /> The shot with the child jumping into the pool of vomit could have been improved. The child should have shown more charm for the puddle, he should have stepped on and stirred his feet, he should have had his head bent to look at the puddle with all his attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell did not deliver. He plays a non-communicative man, it is true, but instead of transmitting his inner turmoil to the voice, to the gesture, to the movement of the body, the film is based on the narration off-screen and on the dialogue with his imaginary alter ego of the macho, played Denis Leary.
