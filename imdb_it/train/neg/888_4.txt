This was a film I couldn't wait to see! So I finally understood and was rather disappointed. For beginners, the film said so little about New York, just a little confused shots of buildings, streets, bridges and cafes. It doesn't focus on the magic of New York. Another thing that made me change my mind was the French film set in this film. I know it's a remake, but it's not a French-style remake! However, here you will notice elements that remind you of French films, such as long and messy scenes, no or little talk and, of course, everyone is smoking in French style! The story follows many lives (too many for my taste) and somehow seem connected to the end. I feel like there's no dedication to the characters as much as there was in the stories. The film was too short to cover every single destiny, the happy ending of all. We can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each. And there you have your 120 minutes! if you like dialogues of active scenes and stuff this is not the movie for you! I give it 4 just because I love New York and I loved the cast!
