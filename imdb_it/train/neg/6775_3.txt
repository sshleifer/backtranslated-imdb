I was quite happy to find this film in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, what's wrong so far? It's the kind of film that asks me two things: when all the people involved (including some well-known names) realized they had a turkey in their hands, and what's the worst thing about a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering plot, in front of the long-winded script sometimes pretentious, the uncertain tone, the lack of a coherent and well developed characterization, and the lack of relationships between the characters. You have to add a very irregular acting to the criticism, but it is understandable that the actors are struggling with this stuff and in addition they seem underestimated. Very often they can barely get their jokes fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban character, but sometimes he seems uncomfortable and detached in his delivery. I must say, however, that I felt relieved when the initial suggestions that his character will accompany with the indescribable Jayne Mansfield will go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What does the film mean? - For me mainly the beauty of Parker who also acts with moderation and dignity like Grace Kelly. In general, the film is beautiful to look at. Navy characters are very intelligent in their uniforms - but you must be amazed by the horrible black Fu Manchu tunics they wear in their luxury suite. Even Grant can't look elegant in his. Returning to the merits, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in listening to a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speaking without an alleged German accent!
