The Return is one of those films for that niche group of people who like films that bore them and confuse them at the same time. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a dark woman who does not kill vampires or strips for nothing during the film. I was willing to put up with this, but I wasn't willing to put up with the worst editing ever combined with unnecessary flashbacks. Eventually it turns out he crashed into his car when he was young. Or maybe I was wrong and that was just a flashback. With this film it is impossible to say. Can you believe that the same guy who made Army of Darkness produced this shit? A much better idea is to stay home and watch Army of Darkness on the Sci Fi channel. That movie had it all: sluts, zombies and a guy with a chainsaw on one arm. The Forgotten Ones didn't even have one of these things.
