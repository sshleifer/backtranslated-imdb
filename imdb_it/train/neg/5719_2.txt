This film looks a lot like the movie Hostel, except with * BAD * acting and not much suspense. The blood elements are there, but nothing is heard for the characters, making the violence not very effective. Some parts are just weird ... like forcing a snake down someone's throat. What happens with that? Should it be scary or bloody? It's just a little stupid. As for torture, in reality there is none (except that the type is fired at gunshots in the beginning, which they don't show anyway). The main villain keeps saying "let them die slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. The deaths are all relatively fast. Yes, I looked at the "unrated" version. So, overall, it's not the worst gore movie I've ever seen, but not at all good either. You will not miss anything if you skip this.
