The first film Cube was an art film. He established a world in which all the major archetypes of humanity were represented and showed how they tried to make sense of a hostile world they could not understand. It was, at a non-literal level, a "man against cruel nature" plot, where in the end the individual who represented innocence and good triumphed to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty quarrels; a world in which there was no longer any struggle but peace. I rated Cube 10 out of 10, and it's a movie that would never have sequels. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube was a huge disappointment. Some ideas were quite interesting, but in the context of the original film, both the plot and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. However, to be quite entertaining, I classified it as a 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, while ignoring the second, sounds like a commercial b-movie rehash far lower than the first, sans symbolism. There is no "tribute" or "tribute" here; there is only the tear. The same type of plot, with some idiotically altered elements (like having letters instead of prime numbers between cubes - an idea that shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off without absolutely originality and nothing to say). <br /> <br /> Seeing something from "behind the scenes" means nothing, because observers are only part of the Big Bad Experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing. And, in this film, those who come to the exit (as Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are simply killed - where does * bleep * make sense in this ?! He's just flippin 'stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​and acting in Cube Zero are not so bad, but the story and ideas are so totally devoid of any inspiration that this film can only get me a rating of 3 on 10.
