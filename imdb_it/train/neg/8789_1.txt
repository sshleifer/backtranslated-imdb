I checked this on DVD for a dollar, so I could easily smile while playing this terrible movie. every time you think it can't get worse, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely horrible. the plot makes no sense. The title "Cold Vengeance" in the DVD version of the United States has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so clearly taken in their first take. There are many errors during the dialogues that indicate that there is no intention to make another attempt to at least try to make this movie bearable. I can't remember seeing a worse movie and sometimes I get ugly - well, except for the unstoppable Wesley Snipes. No, who I'm kidding, while a bad one, Unstoppable deserves the awards for Best Film at the Oscars compared to this piece of shit.
