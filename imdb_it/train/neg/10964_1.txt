I was unlucky enough to have seen him at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this film was the last nail in the coffin. Being a devoted fan of the "Alice" books by Lewis Carroll, I was very excited about the premier of this movie, which made it much more uncomfortable to watch. Normally I'm excited about modern re-tellings if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between past and present within a family history. Unfortunately this film was less of a modern revisitation and more of a perversion of pop culture. The adaptation of the characters of the original seemed youthful and usually proved horribly annoying. The fact that even the actors were not very good was probably not helpful. Most of the performances have been ridiculously exaggerated, which I assume is due to bad direction and an effort to remedy a bad script. I didn't laugh once for the duration of the film. All the lines were obsolete references to events not so current that surely lose their intensity over time. In fact, the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is about to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Furthermore, I should say that the conversion of the game of croquet into a dance-off rave was horrible. It was undoubtedly the lowest point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Don't see this movie. After his conclusion I was genuinely angry.
