The worst movie I saw from Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no history, no humor, nothing at all! Action sequences seem more like a series of randomly-stitched Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up ads. Strongly influenced by The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed. <br /> <br /> I didn't have many expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience that makes you wonder "What were these guys thinking? ?? !!". <br /> <br /> The only thing you could remember after seeing it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn't rate '1' is that every time I think I've seen the worst, Bollywood is wrong.
