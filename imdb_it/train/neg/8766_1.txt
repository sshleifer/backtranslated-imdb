I should make an alarm everywhere saying the movie should not be watched. He does not succeed in such a magnificent tribute that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect was horrible, I did not expect the director's total failure to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun that shoots normally at 600 blows per minute at 1/10 of the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling at a distance of at least 20 feet? Why do artillery shells fall only on both sides of the road and not on the road itself? <br /> <br /> Not only did I feel sorry for this lack of weapons, they were the cliché situations and the incongruity of the dialogues that made me scream a murder. There were standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, isa laath mat maro and Pakistan if jyaada musalmaan at Hindustaan ​​me and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a screenplay and show. There is no flow in the film. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is only one shooting after another without any connection to the general scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are horrible. The army chief of staff seems unconvincing. To make matters worse, the theater people indiscriminately cut the footage to fit the four-hour movie in 3 hours.
