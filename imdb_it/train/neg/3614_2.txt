A schizophrenic fled from a New York psychiatric hospital and soon the teachers begin to be assigned to St. Trinity University. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) has to do with the chaos of red herring. Despite a running time of 78 minutes, this inexpensive slasher drags back and forth until the lame ends where the person you suspect is that the killer from the beginning turns out to be one. Director Richard Haines can barely sweat with some stalk-st-n-slash staging but delivers the lump that the 80s audience was probably craving. For all of our amateur anthropologists out there, this was shot in New Yawk in the early 1980s so that we could control the whole culture, beliefs and practices of people living from that distant place. The film gets some credit for the "Final Girl". You rarely see it. Also, it's always nice to see a horror movie in which a priest is the murderer. Don't you trust the clergy, my beloved film industry? Fortunately, this is just a fake priest and he is captured. However he is still working on the moral ground angle.
