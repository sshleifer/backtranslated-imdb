The best thing about camp movies in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a daytime soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you can immediately follow the succinct plot, identify the cardboard characters and watch with satisfaction while all the cliches are coming true. However, sometimes the director does something really unexpected. It could be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange or insightful. The director Makinen is up there with the best directors of the field, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There is nothing good about this, but it still manages to be a coherent whole. Not once does the film slow down - the action continues and the fists keep coming. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no sense of time: some characters seem to take months to do something while other characters have only spent an hour in a bar. This is partly due to Finnish summer, where the sun never sets, so don't experience the day turning into a night. <br /> <br /> Finally: there is a plot, there, somewhere. You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it, though.
