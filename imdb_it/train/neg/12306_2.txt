This film is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but he too can't save the tired idea and the Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do NOT feel that other users' comments reflect the poor evaluation received from this film (and rightly deserved!). It is extremely misleading. I have often seen this film marked at $ 3.00 in the supermarket and now I certainly know why. <br /> <br /> If only I could get my 90 minutes back ...
