This film is viewed. I didn't laugh so much for a movie that was unintentionally funny for a long time. Leno should have remained standing and late at night on TV. The machines in the film were fantastic, but the film itself is the stupidest film I've ever seen. it's pathetic, the acting is horrible and the plot may have been written by a 4-year-old child. don't get me wrong, Jay Leno is funny, but not in this movie!
