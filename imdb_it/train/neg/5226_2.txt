This was one of the blandest films we've seen in recent months with a predictable storyline and a pretty nasty acting (mainly from supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie obviously made a lot of effort to learn how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character required only that it dives at the end of the pool kiddie. The film is based on the appearance of an adorable girl and great music, but these are not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio, or the inside of a British bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10.
