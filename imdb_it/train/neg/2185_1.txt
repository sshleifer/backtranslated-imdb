... or an audience. A brief summary .... <br /> <br /> So you have this doctor who is experimenting with stolen parts of the body for some vague reason. He wants to perfect transplants, but feels he has to do it in his cellar. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, her boyfriend cuts his head in a car accident for which he is responsible. Agonized by pain, he keeps his head in a pan for lasagna (or is it a strudel?) And fills it with "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then he wakes up, speaking with his head down (so to speak) even though his neck is obviously severed on his vocal cords, and he has no lungs so he can't speak even though he has it. It seems that the ungrateful b * tch does not appreciate all that her boyfriend has done for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then her pain turns into a cornea when she sees the possibility of engaging her beloved's head on the body of the first sleazy child she can pick up from the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a kind of ten-dollar shop, enters into philosophical discussions with his head, who has formed a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist has one). Eventually the screenwriter understands that he cannot continue to inflict his misogyny and fear of intimacy problems on the public endlessly, so he kills everyone, so presumably he goes to the bank to cash the check before the film financiers have a chance to stop paying on it. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that I think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies not to show that modified version again without gory things. The sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off, twirling around the house without leaving much blood everywhere is simply too precious.
