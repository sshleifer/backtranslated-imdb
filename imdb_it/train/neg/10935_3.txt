I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being a Mormon, I always thought humor was too exclusive for the LDS community and made us look like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air, the Halestorm movie that I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I thought since this had a B-list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), this should have been at least a bit strange. And besides, church basketball is mature with potential for lots of hilarious and similar gags. But I have to say that during the whole movie it seemed that nobody knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat, and every opportunity for a really fun gag was ignored. The dialogue was bland and the film had one of the worst developments of the character I've ever seen. Every single character, but Wilson's, was less than one-dimensional. It is hard to believe that after nine rewrites the film was still stale like the sinking of the train I witnessed. I can't put into words the anger I felt sitting through this. My friends and I had appeared in the final scene of the game, so we went to the Washington City premiere, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I must say that I avoided any contact with him after the show. He waited at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not tell him that his film not only tore off a good hour and a half of my life, but left a nasty painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> some specific problems I had: there was a small secondary love affair between the janitor and the chubby pianist, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and it was impossible to worry about it, so my friends and I remained constantly wondering why we had to worry about these two lame and uninteresting characters. There were many subplots that skipped from time to time, each of which promised the public a chance to laugh, but each went and left in a cloud of smoke, ending up before I could begin to worry. This was practically the way the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This film was a huge disappointment, and I feel bad for everyone who expects the first fun Mormon movie. True, the jokes in this are not too exclusive for Mormons. Then again, it's hard to tell which was a joke and what was a strong resonance in the ears. <br /> <br /> Please DO NOT watch this movie. Keep in mind the fantasy that this movie is fun. Save yourself the disappointment I went through
