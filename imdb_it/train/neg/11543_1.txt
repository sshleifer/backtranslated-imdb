Even though I use this site often enough to see how other people value what I think is challenging or just funny movies, after watching this "movie" on Film Four last night I felt compelled to write something, even if it helps me purify me once again. <br /> <br /> The film was perhaps the most superficial experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Sure?) and Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully like Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock ) had no real substance about them - I'm not sure that the first half hour of the film didn't produce the final cut but certainly in a revenge movie you'd like a bit of empathy with the victims ... here I don't it could matter less In fact, the only character I cared about was the dog, with the deer approaching a second. And both animals staged Dire (sic) and Scully, which were frankly terrible. I imagine you are as good as the script you were given, and I would like to warmly thank the writers, the producers, the director and the whole cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity.
