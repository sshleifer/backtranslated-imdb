Surely, definitely the worst movie I've ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors of this opinion could argue that this title should not be judged according to the same criteria as others, since it is an independent film, low budget, but are we going already? dilettantism and small innovation are horrible. <br /> <br /> Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film, such as acting with an unbearably weak mind (when it's so bad you make another attempt to shoot the scene, damn it), the thing I have found most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming that such a thing existed during production. There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the spectators, the girls changed personalities several times and seemed to show absolutely no signs of rationality or even brain - five girls relatively fit against a slight female psychopath ?? fight against her, why don't you do it? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered a sort of conquest for this title is the camera that does not leave the van at any time so the viewer seeing everything from within it - that is, like the rest of the film, a good idea performed exponentially terribly. <br /> <br /> ?? oh and anyway, is this movie NOT NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title shot with a hand-held camera ?? this is an effect and not a trait! Intelligently used it can be breathtaking, but in this case it is an excuse for inadequate cinematography.
