Management must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talking about a skit for Fawlty Towers. He had to stick his car with a branch. The first branch was too fragile and not funny. The second branch was too rigid to be funny. The third was fragile enough to be funny. This type of attention to detail is missing in "Corky Romano". No matter how embarrassingly a bit comical it was, it wasn't fixed, and it wasn't left on the cutting room floor. The only value I can find in this film is like a study of a very imperfect film, which somehow escaped distribution without being repaired. <br /> <br /> I have scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews that praise this absolute waste of time reinforces my suspicion that some people are being paid to promote titles. I can't understand how someone over the age of 9 could vote for this title over a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can't imagine anyone, not even those who make money from this, evaluate it even on average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. And actually, I like the three marmittoni and I can even tolerate Ed Wood!
