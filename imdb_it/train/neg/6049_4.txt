First of all, anyone who thinks that this sequel to "The French Connection" by William Friedkin is superior, is definitely completely crazy or idiotic or both. The problem with the review of this film is that, a.) It is a sequel to a brilliant film, which always makes the vision objectively difficult, and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted I like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug trafficking in the decadent city of New York, because of his documentary approach to action and history, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever, or " The Manchurian "Candidate" and "Seconds", and with his "French Connection 2" it seems that someone is trying to be gritty and not having the real understanding to do it.The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel to Gene Hackman himself tells us a lot about Hackman's approach to the original film as well, and it is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed never to work with him again, he also known that he imagined that the character was more one-dimensional, losing weight and trying to interpreting him as a straight character, shows you that Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the film and the story look great The point of Doyle's plot to become a junkie is interesting, but does not guarantee the rest of the film. An unfortunate weak spot in Frankenhimer's filmography.
