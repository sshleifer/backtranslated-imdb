Imagine the fucking annoying goth college kids in a scat film, throw yourself in a pinch of history and a lot of horrible acting, and you're not even close to how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> Shot bad, bad effects, worse acting. Attempted attempt to upset the horror. Everyone I've shown this gets down to watching it. Sex scenes are disturbing, not necessarily because of their content, but more because they are just something you want to end as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just dirty, even before it reaches the boy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who loves watching movies that people hate, and that's why I chose this. But for your own sake, save time and avoid this aversion. It's so bad. I literally threw it in the trash.
