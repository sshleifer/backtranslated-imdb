It's a bit strange that a story set in an area of ​​Oslo where a high percentage of local residents come from an Asian environment NEVER EVENT AN ASIAN OR AFRICAN PERSON, not even as an extra. This fact probably describes the Norwegian race relations in general. - However. <br /> <br /> NO SPOILERS - ONLY A BRIEF INTRODUCTORY DESCRIPTION: <br /> <br /> Buddy portrays four young people living in a shared apartment in Oslo. The protagonist is two young people who cannot manage their lives in a serious way, and one could say that the film could be about being undecided and avoiding responsibility - a kind of fear of growing up. Narrative plays on typical adolescent dreams, fantasies and lifestyle behavior patterns. Quite the cliché. Even if the story is slightly funny, the acting is good and as a "young person" you can somehow identify with the "crazy" situations of the characters and the complicated love stories, I don't find the story or the characters very credible. To polish and without depth. This film uses all the pleasures of the classical public to create an entertaining film that has the same intellectual depth as "Friends" (yes, this is the TV show). <br /> <br /> Has the Norwegian film finally found its identity? pleasers in well-known American style. <br /> <br /> How about watching Luksas Moodysson's Tillsammans (Together).
