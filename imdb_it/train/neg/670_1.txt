Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) being chased by a psychopath who tries to kill her during the night of the dance. And in doing so he kills his family, his friends and his enemies. <br /> <br /> Now, before we get started, let me tell you that you're tired of the PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. You are tired of the stupid girl "Oh my god" and talk about girlish things. And you're really tired of the girls in relationships and then you cry. And the last thing you're tired of is the United States making Asian, Japanese and Chinese films. This sums up the Prom evening but I haven't finished with the review yet. <br /> <br /> The only reason to see "Prom night" is to break the laughter with the killings. Otherwise, don't see Prom night. You never see the killings, you only hear screaming and you see blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeated like 24/7. So not only are they not scary but it is hateful. When I met the cast, I think I'm ready to throw it. Too much girlish talk, too much boyish talk and a lot of "Oh my God. It's our dance." Night on the list of the worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films, I too would be the first. I will not be surprised if it will be released on DVD for a cheap and fast price. the economic fears and a "Night to die" when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. (PS If I could give the film zero star I would do it).
