I can't say this is the worst movie ever made, but I personally think that way because when it was originally released in theaters, (1) the initial buzz was pretty good that my girlfriend insisted on going to see it, and we actually STOOD IN LINE to get tickets, and (2) is still the only "serious" movie I remember when the audience started laughing at some point and practically laughed at the movie in the rest of the movie. Once I reach the infamous (and interminable) snake fight scene, I think everyone has surrendered. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can grant is the lush shooting position. Oh, and there's Bo's breast, too, although his acting is so wooden that nudity is unerotic and it's not worth much more than a Playboy script. <br /> <br /> The "dramatic tension" of this film is between Bo terrible acting and horrible direction of her husband. The snake fight must be one of the most incompetent "action" sequences ever filmed. However, this is one of those films that is bad enough, it might be worth looking at the level of involuntary humor. Definitely the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
