Sometimes a film is so terribly terrible that it has a destructive effect on morale. You really start asking yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to bear these many clich√©s and still have fun? <br /> <br /> Obviously, it is still a pillar of Hollywood to make GUN the main character, the plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in the movies. The character needs a gun. He gets a gun. I can't do it because he has a gun. First put the gun down. OH MY GOD What will we do!? He has a gun! It makes it sway, acting more mischievous than real human beings do. He pushes him in the face of someone for 90 minutes, shouting questions. The hallmark of each conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> It is a real challenge to make a formula so tired and banal again; a film must be very intelligent and well executed. This is neither one nor the other. It has no life or personality and sucks these components from YOU. it will make you feel SIN to live in the time and space you do. Really, who needs this !? So yes, I'll say it: I think this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone involved in the creation of this sub-mediocre soul that kills trash should be publicly embarrassed by the disruption they have done to all of us.
