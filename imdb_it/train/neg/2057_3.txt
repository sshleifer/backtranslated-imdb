I'm sorry to go against the tide, but I thought this movie was unrealistic, boring and too long. I got tired of seeing Gena Rowlands a long and arduous battle with herself and the crisis she was experiencing. Perhaps the film has some cinematographic value or has represented an important step for the director, but for pure entertainment value I would like to have missed it.
