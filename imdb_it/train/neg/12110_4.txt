What is most striking about this semi-musical Berlin set of the 1920s is the wonderful cinematography and editing. It is the top of the First National line in these departments. The story is slightly engaging and similar to the plots of the other two Miller films (SUNNY, SALLY) in which the working girl is mocked by a rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final closure. All four musical numbers are grouped at the beginning of the film and we go a long way without any further musical urges. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and repeats A CAUSE OF YOU. There are also NOT EVER BE BLUE and YOU ARE NOT THE FIRST. <br /> <br /> Miller is very engaging and pleasant here, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in ways and deliveries. Sad, she doesn't dance because that's her forte. SALLY remains his most beautiful film, with this enthralling second and poor SUNNY a much lower runner up. His life was tragically interrupted by sinusitis before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. These films are worth a visit to see Ziegfeld's best star in the 1920s.
