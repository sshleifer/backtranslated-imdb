The acronym "F.P.1" stands for "Floating Platform # 1". The film portends the construction of an "F.P.1" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to be used as an "air station" for transatlantic air flights. Based on a novel by Curt Siodmark contemporary; it was shot in German as "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), in French as "I.F.1 ne r√©pond plus" (1933), and in English as "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology has made the non-stop oceanic journey much more preferable. <br /> <br /> Stars Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find love and sabotage inside and outside the Atlantic platform. Directed by Karl Hartl. Mr. Veidt is more fun to watch; but it is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Mrs. Esmond and Mr. Fenton. The younger co-stars were the spouses of Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both the concept and the film have not aged well. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl ~ Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
