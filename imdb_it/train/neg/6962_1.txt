How can actors as good as Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet have been involved in such ... a ... well, such a thing? I can't understand it. It was horrible, very bald he played (but some of the few main roles), the jokes are stupid and absolutely not funny ... I won't talk about this movie anymore, except for a little advice: not going to see will be a waste of time and money.
