If this film is meant to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them, I waited for something to happen and never did anything. This film is neither horror nor drama. It's just the paranoia of methamphetamine users. This film could win a prize for using the word "F" so many times and so unnecessarily. It was not well said, but I felt that they were doing Meth to replace Meth who owed someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid when the movie went on and the girl became even more desperate. The ending really didn't make sense. The film made no sense unless it showed how annoying it is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth. I relied on the other feedback when I decided to watch this film and the rating on this film should be a much lower average.
