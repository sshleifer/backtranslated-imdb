I watched this movie last week sometimes and had the biggest laugh I've had in a long time. The plot of the film is rather stupid and complicated in a poorly elaborated way. The only advantage that can be found in any part of the film is Corey Savier's impressive abdominals. Alexandra Paul (I think it's her name) is horrendous as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is lousy and his character is an idiot on top of everything. And as if the fact that you think she's having sex with her son is not enough, they throw in any case an absurd sax solo! The end and the climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and even ridiculous. I mean who the hell wants to bring the son of a crook who tried to make you believe he was your son and you were having an incestuous relationship with him!
