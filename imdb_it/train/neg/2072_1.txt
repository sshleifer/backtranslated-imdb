I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a funny movie. I thought you couldn't really go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers. <br /> <br /> ... but the film was confused and useless ... <br /> <br /> it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing things away. Even the writer continued to throw away a lot of toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenager could love. <br /> <br /> It seems like it would have been so easy to draw a story from Fatal Attraction Super hero ... but I guess not. <br /> <br /> This is not a fun romantic comedy that has been advertised to be. You can't bring a child to see it and you're ashamed to see it as a date. <br /> <br /> If the writer could make a basic story around the high concept and clean it up, the film could have a chance to fight. <br /> <br /> A serious waste of time. <br /> <br /> B
