Being a Billy Bob Thornton fan, and the diversity of his abilities, I noticed this film listed, and I was surprised not to have heard of it. <br /> <br /> I had traveled more than usual during the time it was filmed in 2000, and when it hit theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later (that passage of time is the first clue not everything went well with production). <br /> <br /> Now Patrick Swayze cannot act for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to wear make-up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person who would be a pleasure to see, even if she showed her looking at the dried paint. <br /> <br /> Being curious, I checked the information on the production of this site. He made a huge <$ 600 per screen on his opening weekend, and just over $ 400 each, after the month of theater performances in the last 2002. Altogether it was $ 261K, which I doubted could cover the hotel and the food of the cast and crew for a week position. <br /> <br /> The story is rather benign, and even the use of the usually interesting Reno venue is as boring as the rest of the others. <br /> <br /> It is something like several SNL bits put together, none individually too big, and the overall presentation even worse. <br /> <br /> Whatever it was, the costs for this production had to be considerable - even if everything worked for less than usual fees - so the only thing that made an opus barely tolerable was the quality of the filming and the present by Billy Bob (although understandably a bit laconic here, compared to his usual work. <br /> <br /> Think of the three superb, totally different characters that portray in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa, "and you know he did this job under the standard, long before the spectators had the opportunity to confirm it. A star for him, even here, and one because the production was better than the typical" Lifetime "movie.
