Amy Heckerling's second film, Johnny Dangerously, is a parody of the 1930s gangster films made in the tradition of Warner Brothers. Michael Keaton plays a middle-aged gangster who looks back on his life of hard blows when he discovers a child trying to steal something from his pet shop in 1935. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) has health problems, so Keaton falls in a first age crime via Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, the fargan Richard Dimitri plays a rival crime lord from Boyle and eventually Keaton rises in the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a hilarious turn as Danny Vermin, yes it's true, Vermin! Griffin Dunne is Keaton's younger brother who became district attorney, his wife Glynnis O'Connor and Marilu Henner portrayed Keaton's moll. The film seems notoriously cheap, making a TV show look like a movie instead. <br /> <br /> The movie starts off great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. Due to the combination of dialogues and gags, the film remains valid for the first half, but then quickly loses steam and falls into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. Keaton chews the scenery by making his best impression of James Cagney. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are just hateful, not funny. Piscopo does "once" a little too many times. Several secondary actors try to keep up the fort like Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, Ray Walston as a peddler, Alan Hale, Jr. as a desk sergeant, and Sudie Bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. The second part evolves into a type of hit or miss television signal and never recovers. The final scene that uses The Roaring Twenties is an anachronism, as is The Call of the Wild's Clark Gable, seen on a marquee at the beginning of the film. I think Heckerling should have known better, since the relevant public would certainly be aware of the actual 1939 release date of The Roaring Twenties. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
