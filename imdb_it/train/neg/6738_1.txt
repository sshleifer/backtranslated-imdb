There have been so many movies based on the same theme. single cute girl needs a nice guy to impress ex, pay him and then (guess what?) falls in love with him, there's a bit of tinkering followed by a row before everyone invents before the happy ending ... this has been done many times. <br /> <br /> The fact is that I knew it before I started watching. But despite this, I couldn't wait to do it. In the right hands, with a good cast and a brilliant script, it can still be a nice way to spend a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> this was none of these. <br /> <br /> this was terrible. <br /> <br /> A female protagonist with no charm or spirit who could not illuminate even the slightest spark in me. I didn't really care if she "took her man" or remained single and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male protagonist who, after some of his infinite words of wisdom, wanted to kill. Just to remove that smug look. I had no idea that leading a whore life was the road to all-seeing, all-enlightening enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A totally unrealistic film full of unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have a job, everyone had more money than common sense, a groom that still goes on with his marriage after knowing that his bride was sleeping with his best friend .... besides "I will miss you even if we had never met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I'm wasting even more time with this waste ..... I could complain about the introduction of a character just to have a very cheap laugh at the "woody" name but in reality that was the only remotely humorous thing that happened in the film.
