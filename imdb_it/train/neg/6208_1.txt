There is only one word for this film. Frightening. The director is clearly talented but, like his character Robert Carmichael, he throws it all away. <br /> <br /> Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't be bothered to use it. Being dragged into petty crime and then falling into depravity is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids, this film portrays young people without aspirations or respect. Cray cries for attention, but deserves none. <br /> <br /> I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to push into the faces of the public. Assume that the public is unaware of the atrocities of the world. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on the wall of a bathroom, it shows the male depravity with adolescent joy. <br /> <br /> Some quality actors have small parts in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, the young Joe and Ben are making trouble. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is disturbing. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of celebrated chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how he was able to undergo such an ordeal is incredible. The film is never thin and Monica is treated for the most gratuitous violence that is interrupted by the war action. War images are used to convey the idea that young people cannot help themselves, that acts of violence occur even in "civilized" countries. This is certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society in which males have an increasingly less important position, but Cray falls to the level of barbaric males who try to expose such brutal and violent images through his use. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or in the case of Manville a faded mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first film. I listened to what he had to say during a Q & A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film reveals his naivety. The film should be released later this year, but I hope the company fails because the public doesn't really need this kind of messed up material.
