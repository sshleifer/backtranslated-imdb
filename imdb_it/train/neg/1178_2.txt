The completely ridiculous "period" film is just a subtle excuse for its broad graphic representation of the heroine affair with "the beast", a monster that apparently appears every century to rape some women. This is more or less what it does, and the depiction of the beast film is really terrible; he is basically a tall guy in a fur suit with a mask and a huge PVC pipe for a hard-on that splashes copious amounts of white liquid. For fans of fake animal pornography, I imagine this is real excitement. I was amused, however, by the initial shots of horses having sex in a public square.
