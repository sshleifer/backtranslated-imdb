I found myself very involved in this film, at least at the beginning, and whatever credit I gave to this film, it's Lacey Chabert, it was fantastic !! But this is where it ends. I seem to be very good at understanding who the killer is, and I like it when a film is able to disappoint me completely, but I felt out and lied, they took the whole time in one direction and then suddenly decided to end going in a completely different direction, they did not give us any shock, it is not misleading that bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all! <br /> <br /> I heard the film would have been much better if they had remained faithful to the plot that guided you, they too seemed to answer nothing, because Jane (mary) burned the professor's house. <br /> <br /> It is a great pity as I heard it started as a relatively good film.
