*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HERE! *** <br /> <br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what could happen to Madonna if it ever gets stuck on a desert island. There is absolutely no challenge for Madonna in this role, and she proves it. She is only Madonna who plays Madonna, and she can't even be right. I know what you're saying, you're saying, "How do you know this is what Madonna really is, you've never met her!" Right, I don't have, but we all remember "Truth or Dare", right? I know Kevin Costner does. <br /> <br /> You would think, in 2002, that Madonna may have learned something, in one way or another, from the "crossover" women who made their way through the silver screen. For heaven's sake, didn't Madonna see "Glitter"? Mariah Carey showed the world of cinema how it was done !!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trash ass to the curb of beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, is the name! All we see from this look in the world of Madonna is that she is the only one in it. <br /> <br /> If there's one thing to say for Madonna, it's that it's consistent. When she was a dear MTV lover, she set the world of women's fashion for 20 years. Now, in the film, he has set the roles of women in the cinema And in society back 20 years, enchanting all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, hateful qualities that women have deemed to have closed within them, qualities they desperately sought prove that they don't really own. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ARE THE SPOILERS !!! DO NOT READ MORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ... *** <br /> <br /> Here is the only good thing I will say about this movie, and I was really impressed. They didn't go for "Hollywood Ending" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical happy Hollywood finale, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her suffering, oppressed and oppressed husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good and decent woman, a woman who would have been the exact opposite of his late wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is saved, and once again, this poor victim of a husband is once again rented with his wife demon, and his life will once again become a living hell. <br /> <br /> *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS ***
