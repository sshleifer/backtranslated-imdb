You know what you are getting when you buy a guarantee ticket. A sweet and trivial verse that will be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a guarantee film. Here we have a ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine coming out of the pension to let us know that, in reality, he didn't die as we thought. Poor Ernie, it's the poor soul who married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this film, Ernie jumps up first and portrays his grandfather who has been linked to his long-lost grandkid. We have seen it before. You could enjoy this movie, but please don't say you haven't been warned.
