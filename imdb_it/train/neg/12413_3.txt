I won't say this movie is horrible, because I've seen worse, but it's not even halfway. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I really couldn't understand what was happening and where things were going. When the movie is finished, I was left to scratch my head. I looked to the end of the credits to see if they had anything after them that could clarify things, but once the credits were over, it was like that. I felt like I was shaken from one weak spot in the plot to another in the whole movie, with a minimal or no transition between the two. <br /> <br /> The character development is very superficial. I could not understand when someone was angry or had a grudge against someone. I can't say if half the characters had to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or just had a bad actor to play them. This film seems to be based on stereotypes (it's a merit, it's hard to avoid using it when you're making a film about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, since so many other movies have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the evidence of a heroin addict trying to come clean. Stereotypes are easy to describe, which would explain why so many bad films tend to abuse stereotyped characters. This film, on the other hand, uses stereotyped characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be rejected without explanation. I guess it's OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I didn't get the chance to meet any of them, so I never lost any of them. <br /> <br /> And last but not least was Sadie's singing. It's horrible. The music that supports her is not a winner, but is usually suffocated by the shrieks released by Sadie's vocal cords. I swear there's a point in the movie where he sings a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought about turning it off during this howl-a-thon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is confusing. The characters are poorly developed, the acting of Georgia is wooden and rigid, the character of Sadie is torn from one negative situation to another, without background or explanation. The music was unbearable and I can't think of any good reason to watch this movie unless you are thirsty for cinematic pain.
