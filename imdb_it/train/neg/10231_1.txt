Honestly, I'm rather annoyed that based on the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I lost almost two hours on his debut offer. Have they all been written by his friends? The action becomes sensational, the music is irritating and abused, the script is simply terrible and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) are mediocre at best. I think we should support the efforts of a young director, but to say that he is ingenious when he is not, will certainly only encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, continuing to write his own screenplays and use the same actors for another company. Yes, it's his first film, low budget, etc. - I understood it, but it is also available for purchase by members of the public and is not even up to par.
