This movie stinks. I don't think I've ever seen such a shocking film. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the acting was insignificant. This could have been a good movie. I think it's simply based on his grotesque images. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it seemed to me that Miike had turned it around for the sake of shooting it. Only a poorly executed film. There is nothing to entertain by watching this movie unless you are fascinated by the exhaustion of explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, self milking, parenting and fraternal abuse and fecal dispersion. I think I just sold the movie to many of you, but I meant it when I said this stinks. He has had success in other films, but I think you would be better off watching someone do the pooping.
