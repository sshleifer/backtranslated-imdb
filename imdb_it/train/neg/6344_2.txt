Well, I'm a fan, a Woody Allen movie I left after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a film I've seen less than half of, but I hope you'll understand why). Basically, it appeared very soon that we would be taken off the screen with: a script that described his presumption as having bullet points; a cast who all tried to be characters of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and were misguided to do so; and a camera that sat portentously, just because there was nothing to film, but to chat and the actor who wore it. Drama? None; it is partially pre-narrated, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Maybe I left too early in this case, but by then I had decided against another hour and a half-liner-clones of Allen. Does the script have its funny moments ?? I went almost entirely on the back of Will Ferrell's excerpts in the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!) ?? but there is little rhythm to make them fly away with nonchalance, as is better. Worse than that there is no fluidity. To say that the wood of this film makes a forest look like a mess: the open discussion about bars is the most skilled case-in-point. The only thing that should be done by the numbers is the review in a vase ?? 2/10.
