Very ugly. Very very bad. As an individual who aspires to do, be in or - at least - smell the restaurant table in a movie set, I find it difficult to criticize the independents who actually made a film of any kind. However, this movie ... oh dear. <br /> <br /> Realizing Frightworld does not aspire to anything more than a gross exploitation (an honorable thing in itself) and trying to make it conform to the most common standards is a mistake. And to be honest, it's more fun than - let's say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not by much. So I will not try to criticize, let me ask you some comments. <br /> <br /> 1) If gore is the point of the film, shouldn't you be able to see it? <Br /> <br /> 2) If you have hired three sound men, make sure at least one knows how to use the equipment. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie your maniac must be scarier than a Smurf doll. Hard I know but really ... <br /> <br /> 4) There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area, most of them can be hired really cheap. Get one that knows how to frame a scene. <br /> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other fantastic programs doesn't mean it should do it every two seconds. /> <br /> 6) Congratulations on bringing the girls to take off their shirts, but next time, take the girls who are the best we want to see take off. <br /> <br /> 7) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood. At least in this type of film editing he should sell the gag gores. A chainsaw that suddenly appears in a stomach of characters is not scary, it is sloppy. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all the acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once he started to fight back. There were some images ordered, unfortunately it was thrown on the screen without rhyme or reason. "Acid Poptart" is a name that deserves a better film. I also like Frightworld's moxie. Next time, now that they have a type of film under their belts, I hope everyone aspires to something better than Colman Francis. Update at least Ed Wood.
