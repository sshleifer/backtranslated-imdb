This film is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The plot is ridiculous and all the shit of "Little Man" is so stupid. The whole film is unrealistic and stupid. Let's face it, it's just a "black comedy". This is just a useless, horrible piece that should never have reached cinemas. The jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous. Please, please save your money rather than see this useless piece of shit. I had to endure sitting at Little Man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed. I am disgusted by the fact that such a thing can also be thought of! Who writes this shit? Actors have no talent why, how do these people get into Hollywood? They are making money with this stuff!
