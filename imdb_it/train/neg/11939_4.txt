Let me tell you something about this movie. I've seen it twice. The first time I was a child and the film really amused me. I really liked it. I thought it was fun and interesting and the main character was pretty cool. <br /> <br /> I saw it again a few days ago. It was horrible. Really. I don't know why I thought it was funny before, but now ... I didn't laugh at all. There was nothing even slightly amusing. It was just stupid. The story was weak. The acting was nothing special. There are great actors in this film, but acting is mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The worst is that this film is racist. Really. Don't get me wrong, I don't usually complain about racism in movies. However I have seen people complain about the lack of black men in films like 'The Shaolin Temple' or the fact that the only black man in 'The Street Fighter' is one of the bad guys or ... Whatever, you get the point. There are people who see racism everywhere. I wonder how they would react to a movie like "The Meteor Man". Why? I'll tell you why. There are no Asians in this movie. There are no white men among good boys. In fact there is only one white guy in the whole movie and he is the boss of the bad guys. All good guys are African Americans. Don't get me wrong, I don't care what the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green ... What interests me is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie. This is the only film like the one I've ever seen. It's not just realistic. If there is only one black man in a Japanese film, as in the case of "The street Fighter", there is no problem - in Japan most people are Asian. But if there is only one white man in an American movie there is a kind of problem - in the United States most people are white. It's like filming a Japanese film with an entirely white cast and just an Asian as a villain. Simply not real. <br /> <br /> Done. I'm giving the movie at the rate of 4/10. It would be 1/10 if I hadn't enjoyed myself as a child.
