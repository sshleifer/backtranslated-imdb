VAMPYRES <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> A motorist (Murray Brown) is drawn into an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and sneak into their spirit-free sexual lifestyle, but her guests turn out to be vampires with an unbridled urge for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Taking inspiration from the cycle of lesbian vampires initiated by the French Jean Rollin, the nonconformist director, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's "Carmilla" series in the UK, the audacious unfortunate of Jose Ramon Larraz pushed the concept of Adult Horror far more than the British censors were ready to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on his original British release. It's not hard to see why! Using his gothic theme as a pretext for all the nudity, sex and bloodshed that the film's short execution time will allow, Larraz (who wrote the script under the pseudonym "D. Daubeney") uses these commercial elements as a simple background for a languid meditation on life, death and impulses - sexual and not - that affirm the human condition. <br /> <br /> Shot on location in a picturesque country house during the fall of 1973, Harry Waxman's eerie cinematography evokes an atmosphere of dark premonition, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and equally beautiful - seems to prefigure a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz brought out a similar trick in the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller that explodes in a frenzy of violence during the final reel). However, despite its claims, the thin plot of VAMPYRES and its raw production values ​​will share the public from the beginning, and while the two female protagonists are charismatic and captivating as you might wish, the male lead (Brown, past his first at the time of shooting) it is sadly disconcerting in a role that should have gone to some handsome stallion by the age of twenty. An unmissable object for lovers of cult films, a fun curiosity for everyone else, VAMPYRES is an acquired taste. Pay attention to the silent epoch superstar Bessie Love in a short cameo at the end of the film.
