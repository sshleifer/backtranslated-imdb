I am a Catholic taught in parish elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high schools and college. I'm still a practicing Catholic but I wouldn't be considered a "good Catholic" in the eyes of the church because I don't believe certain things or act in certain ways just because the church tells me to do it. <br /> <br /> So back to the movie ... it's bad because two people are killed by this nun who should be a satire as the embodiment of a religious female figure. There is no comedy in this and satire is not well done by the acting of Diane Keaton. I've never seen the show, but if it was very different from this movie, then it could be nice. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the gun could be a fake and the first one who shot everyone a piano by the female protagonist of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate the emotional and intellectual bigotry of Sister's faith Mary. But it turns out that the bullets were real and the story has tragedy ... the tragedy of loss of life (in addition to the two former students ... the life of aborted children, the life of the student's mother), the tragedy of the dogmatic authority on love for people, the tragedy of organized religion that replaces true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity.
