I just watched this movie on a local TV station ("Big Chuck and Little John" by TV8 in Cleveland, Ohio). I had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> I don't know any thesaurus this can even come close to helping me describe how bad this film is. The script is horrible. Acting, beyond one of the two exceptions, is useless since there is nothing in this material that deserves a real effort. <br /> <br /> It looks like a little bit of small ideas, remnants from various writing sessions, which where thrown into a blender. It's not just fun. The appearance of the "parody" is aimed at the best. Some references almost obsolete (even for the time of its publication). No wonder you had never heard of it, it's really bad, worse than anything, Saturday night live, MAD TV or even the color of In Living come out on their worst days. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, it's a great example of how NOT to make a movie. Whatever you do DO NOT REFUSE A CENT. <br /> <br /> Adam
