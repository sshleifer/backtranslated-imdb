Meet Peter Houseman, professor of rockstar genetics at Virgina University. When he's not dancing in the field, he blows his mind and drops his panties in his classroom lessons. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that allows the body to constantly regenerate the cells allowing the man to become immortal. I too would like to be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and I got the sweet female lovin that only the VU can offer. An assortment of old and ugly university professors does not care about the popular Houseman and cuts funds for his project due to lack of results. This causes Peter to be used as a guinea pig for his serum. To my amazement there are side effects and he, take this, metamorphosis! in something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "millions of years". Dr. Mike Sally's crush also sleeps after a full day of getting to know her. You have a child. His name is Tommy. He's an angry kid. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a terrible film, but it is not a well produced film. As long as I saw it, I couldn't get over the fact that it was shot in 1989. The graphic aspect of the film is the quality of the last seventies at the latest. It doesn't help that it is packaged together with films from the 70s, as Metamorfosi is part of the 50 chilling classics of Mill Creek Entertainment. There is virtually no difference in the quality of the film. The last five minutes are purely videos that in reality, at least for me, save the film from a lower rating. Pay attention to computer terminology as a "chromosonic anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can't write! This is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern.
