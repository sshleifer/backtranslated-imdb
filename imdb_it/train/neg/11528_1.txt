Anyone who has written the "cute" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is also bad for backyard wrestling. In reality this is not even backyard wrestling, it's some guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Every guy has about 45 pounds of weight and there is not an ounce of entertainment value in this. It's just a few bored kids who give a bad name in yard yards, if possible. If you want to see some fun fighting in the backyard, take Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. Presents the 2 biggest names of BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. Actually they have gone since they trained and trained them professionally as "real" professional wrestlers. They went legitimate and improved. I recommend taking a look at those 2 guys. MDogg is crazy and out of trouble. So don't waste your time or your money on this lousy DVD, there are "better" videos on the back.
