I have yet to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something I intended to do for quite a while. I'm sure it must be scarier than this movie. I remember skipping once when I saw him the other day, even though I can't remember the scene. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic and I've seen it on DVD, but I'm sure the theater must have been a fantastic show. After the first special effects were made, I was waiting for a story to develop. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie should be freely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was relegated to staring at the beautiful character of Catherine Zeta-Jones throughout the film, basically because there wasn't much else to look at. Lili Talor was such a character. I didn't like her a little, something about the plaintive people. Also, the guy in this movie reminded me of the cartoon Dudley DoRight with his voice and his face. I could not refer to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson has done an admirable job trying to get over this film with some kind of acting. <br /> <br /> From half to three quarters of the way I was dying to go see a campy on Friday 13th or Scream Queenish movie! At least there is some kind of entertainment value. If there is no story, at least fill it with bloody deaths or attractive females. This had nothing. <br /> <br />
