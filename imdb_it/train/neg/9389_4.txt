According to IMDb, as well as for any other website that contains a review; this "thing" does not have a director. Well, that would certainly explain a lot! Only a group of people who have come together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in a thin plot of devil worship and women's sacrifices within the walls of a secluded sanatorium. "Hardgore" is an excellent example of a totally demented smut 70, as it is made with a minimum of production values ​​and scenographic inspiration. Horror films about satanic sects were very popular during the early 1970s and even pornography, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story of a young nymphomaniac girl engaged in an asylum and is attracted by a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rapes, torture and dildos from the first night. Really, a lot of dildo-action. The lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat cut even the same night. The aspects of horror are very little elaborate, passing from ridiculously unpleasant masks of satan to violent and severed penis attacks. The performances of photography and acting are almost intolerably amateur, but what do you expect from a film that contains footage of dildos who shoot semen and talk about male reproductive organs amputated? The protagonist Justina Lynn is a pretty pretty girl with a charming body, but most of her co-stars (male and female) are horrible and excessive hair sleaze balls.
