For a good half hour I remember thinking, "Hey, this could very well be Bill Rebane's best result ever!" The opening sequences are suggestive, there are moments immediately to enjoy and our director also refers to his infamous stinker "The Giant Spider Invasion" in a playful way. The concept is shamelessly stolen from William Castle's "House on Haunted Hill", with three old and extremely bored millionaires who attract nine losers to an isolated villa to win $ 1,000,000 in a preliminary match. Of course, participants start to fade quickly and one by one, and it takes too long before the rest of the bones realize that the old are sadistic ... or there is another murderer among them. The film begins and ends with a strange narrator who tells a lot of foolish things that are not relevant or even interesting for the plot, but there is a nice T & A to admire in the first ten minutes and that stupid child (Shelly, I think) let's call it) it's really exhilarating to watch. After the first half hour, of course the inevitable happens and "The Cold" turns into a textbook production of Rebane with delayed twists, the most stupid dialogues ever and a total lack of excitement. There was no budget for sequences of bloody killings, but our multi-talented director (?) Tries to compensate for this with endless footage of disco girls and an amateur rock band. The film also has four or even five different climaxes and none of them is a bit satisfying. Perhaps it was inspiration for LOTR: Return of the King? Avoid this movie, you will live longer and happier.
