I would like to list this film under the horror genre. I did it because I'm not aware of a genre called horrible. Since the horror genre comes closest to the horrible one, I decided to put it in this category. The acting was amateur. You know who the bad guys would be in the first scene. Heroin is as bad as the movie. Film students should take this film as an example for the lesson on what not to do in a movie. It's so bad. The man the bad word is an understatement. The bad guys hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars. They want the money to be delivered on a Rose Island inhabited in the middle of the Pacific. They would sit the ducks after getting the money. There is no escape plan. How stupid. The female Cruise Director is a former policeman, a seal of the navy, kung fu, I'm afraid. The hilarious part is how to defuse the time bomb. He says he knows what he is doing and continues to pull all the wires one by one. Then he puts it in his pocket and according to the film with all the connections in place. He is crazy? Like us crazy we saw this RIDICULOUS. If you have an M-i-L you don't like it. To annoy her, rent this movie and pretend you like it. I assure you that he will surely tell your partner that you have such bad taste and that your child has married someone below his family standard.
