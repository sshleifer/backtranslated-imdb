I know, I know, "Plan 9 from Outer Space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Manos, the Hands of Fate". But I can't work on those monkeys stockings movies. Of course * they are bad. How could they be useful? But if you talk about films with respectable production values ​​and bankable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl". All the demure melody, all the self-absorbed devotion, which stains all that Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its climax in this film. From its solitary top of horrible, "Yentl" looks back to "A star is born" and forward to "The mirror has two faces". There is nothing else you like. What an emotional resonance Streisand dragged out to make this film, I'd rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing, I can't imagine, though I'll bet there is a nine in ten chance of not being part of it. <Br /> <br /> Nobel Prize winner and saint guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blew it into public for this. It is a tribute to the impenetrable vulgarity of Streisand that not only did not commit suicide, but continued to make more horrible films.
