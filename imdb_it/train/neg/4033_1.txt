It hurts me to write such a severe review, but not doing so I'm simply encouraging these people. First of all, just because a movie is made on a limited budget doesn't automatically make it good or catchy. In fact, in this case, the small budget is probably the only cinematic success as it prevented large sums of money from being wasted on a one-legged racehorse with shit. Have you ever seen a play at the theater? Have you ever heard people laugh and think "what do you hold on to?" Well, these two weren't laughing either. Things went so badly halfway my cat took his first bath ever. This is not film, this is children ... no monkeys that make images that make you feel like they are moving to France. I have to go, there's a clown at my door .............
