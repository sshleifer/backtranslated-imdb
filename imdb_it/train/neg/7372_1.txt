I'm so confused. I've been a big fan of Seagal for 25 years. I've seen all his movies and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as "bizarre". Steven Seagal shares the script writing and producing credits for this film, but I have a really difficult time believing that he would have chosen to dub his own voice for so many of his jokes, with a thin and plaintive voice, not least. What I don't get is, if they were to dub SOME of his jokes, why does his own voice appear on the rest of them? I expect Seagal to grow old like all of us. But the Seagal in this film hardly emanates a fraction of the same bravado, confidence, bravado, charm and sex-appeal that showed us so easily in ALL his previous films. What I missed most was his arrogant, self-confident attitude and his ass-grin that moves so easily into that lovely smile. Where is that attitude and fascination that made him such a big star ??? I hope this film is not an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - in that case, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all know and love has disappeared.
