I really wanted to love this show. I did it really, honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay viewers have their own version of "The Bachelor". With the help of his obligatory "witch", Andra, James, a beautiful and wealthy 31-year-old has the opportunity to love with 15 suitors (or "companions" as referred to on the show). The only problem is that half of them are straight and James doesn't know. If James chooses a gay guy, he travels to New Zealand, and if he chooses a straight guy, the straight guy gets $ 25,000. How can that not be fun ?! Take my hand, let me walk: <br /> <br /> The most sensational problem of this show is the bachelor himself. James is the typical young and successful homosexual with a beautiful smile and a body, the one that would probably take a look at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures. Because they chose to play James as the main man is beyond me. God knows there are so many other hottest and liveliest homosexual men out there dying on TV. <br /> <br /> In addition to his rather normal physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even so, he has an arrogant and smug aura about him. However, if James was standing against a white and white wall where he would have melted inside. I honestly can't remember a single interesting or noteworthy thing that James said during the course of the show. It's so boring and forgettable. In fact, one of his companions advised him not to feel in touch. I thought it was the best part of the show. Furthermore, James speaks with a terribly annoying penetration. It sounds feminine or masculine, but does not utter subsequent tones in the middle of sentences ... so painful to sit. I hated it so much during the show that I kept thinking, "Please, choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate witch" <br /> <br /> Then we have suitors. An exceptionally bland group of men who don't seem to care about what's happening in any way. Equally silly, they seem to be indistinguishable from one boy to another, except, "Hey, that guy has blonde reflexes or oh that has curly hair" Again, incredibly inept casting decisions seem to be the goal of this show. Although it may be trivial to type cast roles, it would have been a lot more fun to watch than these amorphous drones. However, in all their banality, they still manage to overcome James (which is not so difficult to do), a little. You know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually warmer and more interesting than the leader. And the fact that suitors seem to enjoy themselves more on EVERYTHING than with the main man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> Besides, I just thought that Id was pointing to something mentioned on the message boards that I thought was true: heterosexual men are more excited than gay boys. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that all the gay guys were ugly and boring, in fact I found some of them very nice. Overall they were just BLAH compared to the men you would see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorette. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I hit forward during this show. I can accept a main character as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the mundane and apathetic pretenders but PLEASE let God's love entertain me just a little bit. No luck. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting drama, intrigue, sensuality or excitement, you will be VERY disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the suitors can still have a boyfriend in New York (What a scandal!). However titillant you can be guaranteed, this is the ONLY thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is the turning point, but if you have any semblance of Gaydar in you, we will easily find out who is who (it wasn't difficult at all, I was wrong only once). This show is stacking up so much of its chips that it can't deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We will see James and Co follow such exciting activities as learning how to do western dance, shopping for gifts, visiting a zoo and doing gay karaoke. YAWN. Of course, you have the occasional topless ballet but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems of the show: no one seems to have fun - it is there that they are going through the scene trying hard to seem to have fun. And you can't really blame them since the events are all wildly lacking in imagination and lame. <br /> <br /> Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There are no cuddles, no caresses, no kisses (!), No affection. It's just "Ok, it was a boring date, I will return to my ugly, gaudy desire to be the home of the Sydney Opera (a quick kiss on the lips) CYA." This show is so demure, it's ridiculous. I can understand them not wanting to reproduce the perceived indiscretion nature of homosexual men, but come to look at the ****. People who watch TV programs will actually want more than hugs and tenacious kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if it was long but I felt that these were problems that needed to be addressed. I congratulate Bravo for putting on a show of this nature, but the incredibly incompetent way in which this show was handled is shocking. To summarize my three points: Boring + Boring + Boring = go and do something else. You will have more fun waiting for a doctor for an appointment, at least there will be interesting magazines there.
