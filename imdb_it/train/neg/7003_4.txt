(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This sequel seems to have been made to take advantage of the exceptional European box office success of THE CALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and the images of the Avco-Embassy wanted to capitalize it in Even America. Too bad they haven't gone very far since the Hill / Spencer images had only a marginal success here in the United States, and this largely boring and tight film doesn't help at all. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Child swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. They are later involved with arms traffickers who smuggle weapons from a monastery and who mistakenly think they are a couple of federal agents. Everything ends up falling flat, despite a couple of funny scenes, especially one in which Trinity and Child are in a trendy French restaurant and don't know how to behave. And the card shark scenes were also slightly humorous. <br /> <br /> The opening music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a beautiful pop song from the early 1970s by Bobby Goldsboro, while the music throughout the film is pretty good. I'm not sure I want to buy the CD soundtrack but others might do it. <br /> <br /> The film could have been canceled for half an hour and would not have been dragged for so long. It seems that many scenarios are chewed here. In fact, I lost interest in 2/3 of the way. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant buzz in the soundtrack and a poor print that seems to have been sent to that big pile of wreckage in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step back from the previous film. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
