Now I can clearly see why Robin Hood dropped quickly. The first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC has ever aired. The opening scenes were as intense, meaningful and intelligent as the two fighting monkeys, Robin Hood had no character, and sword fighting was simply ridiculous. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood who snapped a cow dressed in makeup at the beginning of the episode - how many people were wearing eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series could have improved drastically since then, but this first episode has quickly silenced people's hopes, and is essentially a pile of cr * p. A great English hero was dishonored. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate this?" I won't, that's for sure, unless the BBC starts to understand what a wise investment is. 3/10
