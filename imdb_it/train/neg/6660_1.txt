Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular does nothing but upset the mind. This show isn't funny, it's not intelligent, it's not original, it's just a bunch of smoking crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional idiots with loud and exaggerated voices that sound like nails on a blackboard. Voice acting could have been better. Then there is the animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too flat, too pointed, too bright and too coated with candy. Then there is humor, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They only take these level B jokes that are not even that funny in the first place and then repeat them until death. They also throw in some useless humor that makes me sick. And finally, last and least, music. It's just annoying. It appears to have been composed on a child's computer and does not generate any emotion. I wish there was a score below 1, really. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show that I try to avoid like the plague. Every time I listen to the acronym, I immediately turn off the TV. If you've never seen this show, don't do it. Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
