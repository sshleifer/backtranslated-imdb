I really expected this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent and I am crazy about aviation and I have a serious love affair with helicopters. I don't like this program because it takes the imagination to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 miles per hour from a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. He hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter, which means he had a pusher propeller at the end of his fuselage providing thrust. <br /> <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly much more than 275 due to the principle of wing flight rotation. And the Bell 222, the "actor" who played Airwolf was not very fast even by helicopter standards. And not much in production. <br /> <br /> There was a movie released during this time called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
