The episodic version of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers takes place at a deadly slow pace, following Johnny Rico who leaves his parents, the (not very attractive) girl he enjoys and joins the mobile infantry. The aliens on the show are not at all similar to the barbaric bugs in the film, but they are squid-like monsters that shoot lasers from the mouth. <br /> <br /> While watching this version, I was continually surprised by how fruity they managed to do it all. The show mainly concerns the relationships between the recruits, and the painful and prolonged looks that are given through their visors of battle armor, with the pop of the synth of the 80s that sometimes comes * during * the scattered battle sequences that eventually reveal themselves in recent episodes. In terms of construction, he owes a debt to Top Gun, sharing a lot in terms of pace and content (and all this implies).
