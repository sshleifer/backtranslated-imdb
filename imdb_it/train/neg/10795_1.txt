Some might tell Shaq to stick to what is good at playing basketball. This film was not even funny at a stupid level. In this film, Shaq plays a genius who lives in a boom box that is not originally a genius in a boom box instead of a lamp. It should help a kid played by the cheerful francais cappra. This film had the most fragile plot in the world of water, the acting was horrible and I think anyone who loves this flim would be afraid to admit it.
