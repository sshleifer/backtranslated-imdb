I found a DVD of "I Dream Of Jeanie" in the $ 1.00 basket at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the "Stephen Foster story", being a musician and a musical educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was made because it was not written on the cover, only that it was a remake of the "Sewanee River" of 1939. The composer's portrait of Bill Shirley is sometimes painful, sometimes ridiculous. The man has no testosterone and is a good to zero! I find it hard to believe that Stephen Foster thought that music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs ... without paying him for them! In addition to this ridiculous notion, there is a 20-minute segment of Ray Middleton and his "Christy Minstrels" with a black face that plays Stephen Foster songs that was difficult to watch, to put it mildly. I can't believe that anyone would consider this film appropriate to resurrect in our present time. It is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten .... moreover, Eileen Christy's portrait of Jeanie was certainly the highest point at this lowest point in Hollywood history.
