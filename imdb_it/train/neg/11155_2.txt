The only reason I saw it is because I found it in my local library (and ruthlessly scold them for wasting public money) and despite the mass of tits and asses, it didn't take long to understand that the fast forward button was my friend. A terrible direction, the work of a pedestrian camera, sporadically passable acting, cynical effects and one of the worst screenplays I've had the regret of seeing brought to life (such as, horribly paralyzed and mutilated) in so much time. The best laughs actually come from the "Making of ..." featurette, in which the poor scholars involved in this mess in HDV try to justify their lame efforts as if they had worked on something special, instead of something that would not be of the all forgotten next week. Wait! Except that somehow someone induced Tippi "The Birds" Hedren, of all, to do a little part, along with Kane "Friday 13" Hodder! As it happened, I will never know and, to be honest, I don't really care. Look at your own risk and don't say you haven't been warned. This is a film for its pretentious, the most vicious. I only get 2 for having beautiful naked women, and even just for a little while.
