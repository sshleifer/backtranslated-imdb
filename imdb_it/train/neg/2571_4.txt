With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you understand that this will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a horrible crime. The film is about Peter Sellers as an elderly gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young man, not to mention an attractive hippy in Goldie Hawn. The film is incredibly bumpy and I didn't understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this film doesn't prove it. <br /> <br /> That song on "arabella Cinderella" is quite beautiful, but it is. I recommend this film only to people who like to watch a film of extreme novelty, this is almost the definition of one. I imagine that this film is more than anything else a sign of the times, in terms of definite experimentalism and all around nonconformism, the problem is that quality is completely taken up and writing, not to mention the direction is so out there. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers in particular is very poor, going to Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to stupid movies like this and to Magic Christian, which was very similar to this in context and style , but that movie had some funny moments. This makes no sense, and I'm sad that someone like Peter Sellers was in this movie. Not recommended for anyone.
