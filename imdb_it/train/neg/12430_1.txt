Home Alone 3 is one of my least loved films. It's the cream of the crop, or s *** if you tend to be more cynical, since it positions itself up (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two, at least intermittently, made me laugh at their stupidity. This made me shiver from the pain constantly and clap when the credits started spinning. No other film made me shiver with pain. Now I will point out exactly why this film is so incredibly atrocious. <br /> <br /> First of all, the plot is ridiculous. Spin around a chip in a remote-controlled car (?!) That is out of place and how these terrorists want it. Stupid things. <br /> <br /> The action that follows is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with traps and all, but watching these boobytraps being performed is, rather than being fun, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or just smile) once, in fact, I just scared myself and I hoped the terrorists would nail the baby. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was little fun and annoying. <br /> <br /> Acting, as done by a group of non-names, varies from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D. Linz is absolutely unlikely and not as funny as the boy, while the terrorists act (and judging by their film titles, they look) as they were hastily chosen on the street ... and well, that's it. <br /> <br /> I can see some people saying, "Friend, it's for kids, don't lose it, man." Well, children might appreciate this, but they can become much better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering the idea. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which sucks - see those reviews for more) are better than that! <br /> <br /> So, in short, this is a hopelessly atrocious film. This was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely tears the first two; the only thing is that it completely insults even the first two. No human being, boy or anything, should find any reason to see Home Alone 3. Ever. It's SO bad. <br /> <br /> 0/5 stars
