If you've seen other films like this, they're probably better. The Omega Man comes to mind. For the merit of the study, they avoided the sprawling, useless, large technofest budget that characterizes such films. Furthermore, the set-up and premise were excellent: four people whose past is practically irrelevant to us are trying to move away from an overwhelming contagious fatal disease. What's bad is EVERYTHING! I get tired of infinitely stupid, careless, impertinent, inefficient and arrogant characters in a movie. This practically describes everyone in the film at some point. I rented it and found myself repeatedly shouting on TV, "no, don't do it!", "Why are you so stupid", "careful!", Etc. A true lack of character development is evident halfway. A film SHOULD give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you really care about what happens to them. This no. Also, there should have been a longer and more engaging end to the film.
