An anthology is always a risky activity and I think this effort should be praised. There are many talents involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I didn't really like this movie based on three problems I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them clash with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, different segments feel underdeveloped for me. Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition. I'm not talking about a happy ending here (or even a final period), but rather, the basic development or even solid configurations that attract you are also missing. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I didn't feel like New York and its inhabitants were portrayed appropriately. <br /> <br /> What you have left are high-class short films that may still be of interest to some, but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied.
