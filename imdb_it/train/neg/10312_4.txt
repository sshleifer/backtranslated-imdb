Impressive for 10 years, I liked the "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie". I understood the controversy, which concerned the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have problems with the young couple's interfaith marriage. <br /> <br /> Watching the show now with years of personal experience, I am surprised that the show was also a success for one, though, highly rated season. Created by veteran TV Bernard Slade, who would write the hit comedy "Same Time, Next Year" a few years after the show was canceled, "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light and superficial comedy that collapsed under its own weight . <br /> <br /> There was no denying the chemistry of real life between Birney and Baxter. But in later years, both actors proved to be better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role on "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family Ties"). Here, they were trying to give life to a show that needed a more obscure comic edge, which could have given the complications deeper into a very controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The show aired Saturday night between two CBS power plants: "Everyone in the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were smart, funny and had a sufficient margin (more on the first than the second) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very intelligent and only had a few occasional laughs. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that was not as nice as I remembered.
