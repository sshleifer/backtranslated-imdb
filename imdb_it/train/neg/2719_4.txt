When a small space globe obscures the stucco on the ground, it soon begins to consume land and gain weight. The only part of this senseless nonsense that I liked are all vintage cars. This dog had so many holes that they could be cut and sold for Swiss cheese. Did this thing actually make 20 million dollars? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were largely overpaid. The "monster" looked very much like a big sleeping bag and the "teenagers" seemed to have children approaching their teenage years. And those explosions from the rifle; he looked like a shotgun with a sound suppressor. The ending was pitifully trivial; obviously the producers were leaving the door open for a sequel ... and there were many. Thumb down.
