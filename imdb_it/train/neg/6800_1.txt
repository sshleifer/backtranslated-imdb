I signed to comment on how terribly stupid this movie is. In addition to being a rip off of the Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other type of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when given such a stupid script, with clich√©s, to work with. It's bad enough if you shout once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself moaning over and over again, you have to conclude that even the director is not the brightest light bulb in the film world, nor are producers for having decided to bring this story to the screen in the first place. Most low-cost actors can apologize for taking on this job, because they have probably shown that they get the money and exposure, not being part of this movie joke is going to earn them any prizes or awards. He could end up embarrassing them for having such a poor judgment to be involved in such a loser. I see no reason to summarize the plot or to give some examples to prove my case, because doing it would be a cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could endure. Just as the study of well-made films can inspire you to make a good work of art and beauty combined with skill, the only thing you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work! Be warned
