An old intellectual talks about what he considers art in movies. Take your Hitchcock, your Chaplin, your Bergman and other things before the 80s. To hide that he has no idea what's happening in theaters these days, he throws in The Matrix. <br /> <br /> But it's not just the same film-as-art blades all over again. This discourse is reduced to outdated psychological banalities: ego-super-ego, anal phase, sexual insufficiency. <br /> <br /> It is decorated with the poor effect of having Zizte modified in the movies he is teasing. For someone who should know a lot about movies, his is, cinematically speaking: yeiks. <br /> <br /> To put it in the words of Zizek - I saw 5 - 7 on the screen last night, or in the words of a great filmmaker: <br /> <br /> Mr. (Zizek), what you just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I've ever heard. At no point in your rambling, inconsistent response were you close to anything that could be considered rational thought. Everyone in this room is now more stupid for listening to him. I reward you (two) points (only), and that God has mercy on your soul.
