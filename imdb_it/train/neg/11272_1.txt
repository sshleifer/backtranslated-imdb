... the first movie I had to go out. And it was the pre-projection of the cast and crew (not that I was involved, I hasten to add). I passed the first hour, so I think I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did you manage to overcome any kind of quality control. An accumulation of the worst in dialogue, the epitome of acting in wood, the terrible cast, all enclosed without plot. The casting of Tara Fitzgerald was bizarre, almost comical. He has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> While I was leaving the screening, the director and producers drank in a bar outside the cinema. Obviously, they couldn't even get over it. <br /> <br />
