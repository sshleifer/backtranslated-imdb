I gave this 4 stars because it has many interesting themes that many have already mentioned. From domestic violence to sexuality and many of the taboos it contains. Outside of the gore I wouldn't call this horror as much as I would do science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's depressing, depressing and hopeless. Although I don't mind a less cheerful ending, I'm really very tired of the clich√© of "human suckers" that is central to every movie. I know that today you cannot get a bachelor's degree in liberal arts without bowing to the height of your self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how is it possible that as a writer / director we pretend to be different from everyone else in the pack and note that the ALIENS THAT KILL THE HUMAN RACE are bad! Right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, go out, find a lake and swim until your arms are tired. That way you won't be around to direct the next movie or write the next book that tells me I deserve to die to be alive. It's silly, not thoughtful and boring.
