Jean Rollin's artistic nonsense about vampires, aliens and the quest for immortality. <br /> <br /> Women are beautiful and photography is amazing. Dialogue is inane. It's a ridiculous mess. Nice to look at but as a semblance of a horror movie or a thriller. I'm trying to figure out if we need to be scared or not. Is it a mass at the same time or not? It's a strange mix of art and horror movies that never gets confused and while it's nice to watch it never seems to "mean" anything, and it's not at all scary even if the occasional snapshot or sequence creates a frying moment. pretentious twentdle. Something to leave in the background like a living wallpaper for those who like naked women.
