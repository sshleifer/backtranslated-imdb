Surely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where I should be laughing? There is not a single suggestion or shadow of an idea. The three main actors are pestilential, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily who can't make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to mention the oneiric insertion on Dracula ... just another expedient, taken from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "film" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called film is too, too difficult to save. I would have given "0" / 10, but the lowest score was 1/10 so I had to overestimate it by a sign.
