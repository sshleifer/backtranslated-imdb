I don't know what the acting style of Donald Sutherland is, or the vocal style, but he always seems to play from behind a massive strip of soggy Kleenex. It's just ... I don't know, THANKS? Somnambulistic? On medicines? Strangely. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I just saw the movie again for the first time from its original version and, frankly, I don't remember it ending something like that. A bad ending, also because nothing is blocked. And the dead husband? The annoying child (and was the baby nicknamed?)? Scotland Yard and military pursuers? I would have liked something to wrap things up and give a dramatic closure to all this, not just at the big panoramic corner. <br /> <br /> And which woman sleeps with the man she knows has just killed her husband? Even if he tried to calm Needle's suspicions to protect his child, he could always have a headache. The last meeting made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
