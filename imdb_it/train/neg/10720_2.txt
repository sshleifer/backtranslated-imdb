I saw this movie last weekend and it's silly and mindless. An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in pajamas? The victims are frightened senseless and cannot escape from an old man who moves slowly. They abandon their torches and their shivers instead of trying to push them away or, duh, burn them. Quentin aka Mr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster aka Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver hungry, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, plot of love. The rest of the cast follow each other in the tombs and wait for the screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl is not ugly but does not lend much to the film. Where is the mummy? Really just a wild curse. This doesn't hold a torch for Universal Mummy movies. Watch this movie if you need to sleep, because you will.
