I made the big mistake of actually watching the entire movie a few nights ago. God I'm still trying to recover. This film does not even deserve an average of 1.4. IMDb must have 0 votes for the films that really deserve it like this. A 1.4 is TOO HIGH. <br /> <br /> I had heard how awful this movie was, but I didn't really think a movie could be so bad, especially on this day and in the era. I thought that all the terrible films of the god were only from the 50s and 60s. My God, I was wrong. Trust me people, this movie is really that bad. It is beyond horrible; it's beyond pathetic; it is beyond any kind of word I can think of. BATTLEFIELD EARTH looks like the best film of the year compared to this movie. SNAKE ISLAND (which until now was the worst movie I had ever seen) seems to deserve some Oscar with respect to this pathetic effort. <br /> <br /> I can't seriously believe that the creators of this movie think this was a serious legitimate Hollywood film production effort. This makes no sense to be called a movie. In the first 25 seconds of the film, I seriously thought I was watching a theater class in high school trying to make a short film. Or better yet, I thought it was a Saturday night live. I mean, it looks exactly like that. The acting is horrible; the whole film almost seems to have been shot with a 20-year VHS video camera. special effects ....... good lord Back of the day's charm has had better special effects than this movie. The scene where he is shot at the door is extremely ridiculous and beyond the mess. I mean seriously, my Intro to Acting lesson from 4 years ago in college, we could all have put together a better film than this. And the worst part of the whole movie, where Arthur is naked in the bathroom. Oh my God, I almost risked it right there. I have a strong stomach, but wow it was horrible. Some people should never be naked and he is one of them. The plot of this film seems to go absolutely nowhere. They talk about legal problems we have never heard again; Ben talks about getting into music that we don't hear about anymore; Arthur says he's looking for work and money for college and the next thing we see is that he's running a porn store. Everything about the film is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> This doesn't have much to do with my criticism, but so everyone knows I'm not a gay. I do, however, the rights of homosexuals and I believe that we should all be treated as equals. And I will support any gay in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this film, who still seems to insult every other word. (WHERE IS THE F * (# * white out?) Hahaha But I didn't want anyone to think that I hated this movie just because it was two gays, it has nothing to do with it: it would have been as horrible as a movie if it were Ben & Jill instead of Ben & Arthur. <br /> <br /> I have just seen this movie to see if it was really as bad as it says. And yes, it was also PESSATO of I had read: let this be a warning to everyone : watch this movie ONLY if you just want to sit down and laugh at how pathetic some films of the 21st century may still be. If you watch this movie and really expect a good movie or some entertainment, I have no sympathy for you. > <br /> On a final thought: how are the world 7 films classified UNDER this on IMDb? There is no way that there are 7 films out there that are worse than this!
