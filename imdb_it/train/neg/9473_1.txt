As a veteran of many, many pretentious French films, I thought I had taken the worst that the industry had to offer and that it could withstand anything. But not this. Useless, implacable, violent, unpleasant, meaningless ... The film has nothing to offer and is a hatred and a casual aggression dressed in a pretentious art. Avoid at all costs.
