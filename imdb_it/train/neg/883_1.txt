The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most sensational and annoying ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a series of cartoons about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and on TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The narrative lines were subtle or non-existent and practically every scene, photographic shot, line of dialogue and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally false. In the end I reached a point after an hour of garbage so numb that I left (something unusual for me in the last few years.) I would have imagined that the film was directed by some aspiring author subscribers from some 3rd film studio program class, but I believe that the director (at one time beloved, talented) Mira Nair took part in this disgusting parody, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has fallen en masse in the cesspool.
