I'm looking at this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so horrible that I can't stop watching it! I'm a videographer and this film makes me sad. I feel bad for anyone associated with this movie. Some of the camera features are good. Most is very questionable. There are some decent actors in the film. Too bad they are surrounded by those who must be the relatives of the director. This is the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! The music was a little better than acting. If you go around watching this I hope it's because there was absolutely NO other option! The sequel (yes the sequel) is coming now ... I think I'll skip it! Jason
