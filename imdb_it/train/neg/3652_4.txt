I saw this movie in DVD format. My copy may have been affected but I was disappointed by the lack of a DVD menu screen. I will say that my initial reason for watching this film was Claire Forlani. While it's fun to watch, I feel that it didn't live up to my expectations that I've found so far from his other films. In reality I was equally happy to see Arkin take on a humorous performance. The other two actors were not very familiar to me, so I can't compare their performances, but they were also quite pleasant. Acting is the only endearing quality of this film in my opinion. The plot, while some might say slightly convincing, lacked direction. I feel that the main problem comes from the script and not from the direction of this film. If you like these actors to a reasonable extent, I recommend this movie, but otherwise leave it alone.
