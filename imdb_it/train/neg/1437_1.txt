I lost the first 10 minutes of the film, but don't think that seeing it from the beginning would have made the difference. I found the film extremely boring and was disappointed by the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in exceptional roles, but all of them were disappointed because of a very weak script. "Kind Solomon's Mines" ... the very short part of the film inside the "mines" was as exciting as looking at the dry paint and I doubt that even a preschooler would have been enchanted by watching the warriors fight ". The whole movie resembled a low-cost American television series Give me Indiana Jones every day!
