If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, read the history of the First World War and not the history of the Second World War. Find out what happened during that war, how the soldiers had to live around dead bodies all the time. Like so many soldiers have gone mad, from what they saw during the First World War, at the time they called "shellshocked" they now call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn the true horrors of World War I, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because he is evil, but simply because it was the only way to cope with the horrors that surround them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this film is missing, like so many others. Read some books on the subject and you should watch the film "paths of glory", the only good movie of the first world war ever made. You will see the soldiers' frustration in that film, the sense of powerlessness and a total devaluation of human life, like nothing but a bullet-catcher. <br /> <br /> Here's what's missing in this movie, it's really the key to understanding Germany. A lost war, in which millions and millions of Germans lost their lives, without a real reason. Then comes a complete economic collapse, after the war. These are the factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> Loss of family members and massive poverty will always create extremism. Unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and it has just become another piece of shit to throw at the pile. With really no real value, there are fiction films based on fictional characters that could give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than this. They have just launched the name of Hitler in this way to sell more.
