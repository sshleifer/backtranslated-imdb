Most of the action films are crude of Hindi cinema, in particular of Sunny and his family <br /> <br /> The film is typical of Sunny with bullshit, big dialogues and melodrama <br /> <br / > The film also has the typical Rajiv The ingredients of Rai of many henchmen and a strange criminal <br /> <br /> The beginning is ok and then the passage in Kenya is good but then the film goes on and on <br /> <br /> The sequence of events moves at a slow pace and nothing exceptional happens <br /> <br /> There are many stupid scenes as the Kenyan policemen are shown as jokers in particular Sharat <br /> <br /> Even the climax is prolonged <br /> <br /> Rajiv Rai does a good job The music is in place, only 1 song works and that's the last TOOFAN The camera work is good <br /> <br /> Sunny Deol is like usual, Chunky acts like a monkey while his serious the scenes are ridiculous, Naseer is fine heroines are pure wood Amrish Puri not it's not even half as scary as it was in TRIDEV the rest is fine
