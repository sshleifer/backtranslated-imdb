Hmmm, a sports team is in a plane crash, ran aground on a snowy mountain and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the meat of their dead companions to survive. Does it sound familiar to anyone? I refer to "Alive" from 1993. The only big difference here, of course, is that a large, white, drunken Crow scare of a Yeti occurs a few times to drag it away. I imagine humans have a better taste than yaks. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the man in the first scene does not have a reliable weapon when hunting the Yeti, nor does he have a backup. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely false. It would have exploded in the air, exploded when it hit the ground or was erased. People would not have survived, but hey, it's science fiction. <br /> <br /> Stupid: They survived and are cold. It might be a good idea to harness some burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death. The fire is hot as it is ... <br /> <br /> WTF: The pilot has the frost formed all over his face while he is alive and talking, but strangely, no one else does. <br /> <br /> Stupid: one of the boys tells the others to look for matches and lighters, but there are scattered parts of the plane on the fire around them. <br /> stupid: they find coats and hooded sweatshirts, yet there in the cold Himalayas, they don't use hoods! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They are staring at a pile of sticks when, I repeat, there are pieces of the plane that BURNS ALREADY. <br /> <br /> Stupid: the Himalayas are famous for their storms. It would be a good idea for them to collect debris to reinforce their structure rather than sit outside the squabbles. There are many pine trees around, whose branches make for excellent insulation. <br /> <br /> WTF: When in doubt, use the arm of a dead person as a splint. <br /> <br /> WTF: If a guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels, bears and leopards in the Himalayas, then why doesn't he know enough to take refuge and place traps from the start? <br /> <br /> Stupid: when you try to trap wild animals, it always helps the senseless conversation in the vicinity of that trap. <br /> <br /> WTF: do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a piece of glass ?! <br /> <br /> WTF: The group was ready and armed to fight the Yeti while the other two were there without defenses. The Yeti ripped the boy's heart and stepped on the girl's head, and the gang did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> So two Yetis and a comfortable avalanche to bury the evidence forever ... or so we think. Mwuhahahaa! The story continues in more idiocy but most of the action occurs in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Nice thought with the javelin and the chain, although this is a bit ingenious (with the magically apparent chain) that was missing at the beginning of the film when they couldn't even catch fire despite the fact that it was all around them. br /> <br /> As is typical for Sci-Fi originals, the loving couple finally kisses like nothing horrible has just happened to them (not to mention that they ate human flesh and didn't brush their teeth in several days). <br /> <br /> The end, however, is a lame quote.
