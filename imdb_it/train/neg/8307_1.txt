This show is incredible in this. . . what it represents and what it focuses on e. . . words cannot describe how crazy ET is. They will report on everything. If a celebrity is even remotely connected indirectly to the story, ET will report on it. If a dog poop in Tom Cruise's backyard, they will report it. If a celebrity dies. . . they will talk about it for weeks and weeks to the point where public opinion envies that celebrity. If a celebrity is on trial. . . ET will signal it for MONTHS at the end. There is no end to what this show will bring back and no time frame that dictates how long they will focus on a story. Is it also considered a legitimate report? Even the news is so annoying, with harsh and bizarre voices and ending with a useless pause to convey a sense of importance. I can't watch this show without questioning the existence of humanity. ET is a big reason why I avoid pre-evening shows in general. I'm sorry that IMDb can only allow a minimum of one star rating and not zero or even negative. For this show deserves -10 stars.
