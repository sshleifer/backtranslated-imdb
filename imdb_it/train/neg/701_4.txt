During the Christmas break, a group of college friends fall behind to help prepare the dorms to be demolished and replaced by condominiums. To make the job a little more difficult, a psychopathic killer of Chucks is wandering through the dorm rooms, preying on the group in various violent ways. <br /> <br /> Registered as one of the 74 'video nasties' listed by the UK in the 1980s, The Dorm That Dripped Blood had a good reputation built before the first viewing. The term "annoying video" highlights some images of great explicit gore, violence, sex, etc.: all the things a horror fan dreams of. So, after listening to all this information, I set myself in Pranks (alt. Title) Waiting for a squalid experience. . . and that's what he was trying to be, but practically completely failed. Visually, the film is not exceptional. Cinematography, gore (with the exception of a couple of scenes) and general management all fail. It simply isn't pleasant to look at. The non-original writing is lacking and often generates random things without a real reason (like the initial killing). There are some cool scenes of death, including a pretty face melt (which can be seen on the poster), but that's all for the positive. The acting is pretty ugly, the story seems unimportant, the killer is not cool or scary, and suffers the only serious mistake that every slasher flick should always avoid: it's a bit boring. Overall, for a film made by some UCLA film students for $ 90,000 (which would be more than double today), The Dorm That Dripped Blood is not a total disaster. It has a couple of good things, and it's quite watchable. . . But, like a slasher, try to be on the level of films like The House on Sorority Row and Pieces. . . it simply cannot be compared. Don't expect much and you could at least have fun. I hate to say it, but this is one of the few movies I've seen that would have been better with a remake. . . yet, they go after great works like Black Christmas. Oh good. . . <br /> <br /> Required horror elements: <br /> <br /> - Subgenus: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some brutally fantastic kills, and the blood is ok for most. . . but nothing special. Moreover, they have off-screened some of the best murders. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is a little unattractive (for me) nudity, but not much. <br /> <br /> - Cool Assassin (s): Nah. The final monologue (s) of the murderer made it rather unpleasant. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: A scary jump or two, but nothing too effective. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: I suppose, yes, but I simply didn't care enough, and it's as obvious as the nose on the murderer's face. <br /> <br /> - - - <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
