My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I found myself with a group of my friends who hated the NBB and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of photos of the film band members and threw them into the fire and danced a cheerful jig around the things that burned while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". This was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol God this show sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of the crappy machine. Guys, you really suck! You really ruined the entire channel! No offense or anything other than you guys need a life, I mean, really, who makes a stupid show with a stupid singer who can't even sing! You guys play really awful and you need to get a hobos life or something, except Roselina. She is really pretty. But anyway, you guys!
