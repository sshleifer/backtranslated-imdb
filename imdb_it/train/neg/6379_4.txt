With a movie called "Gayniggers from Outer Space" how could you go wrong? Just enter some of the main stereotypes for the characters, use the Village People as the main supplier for the soundtrack and launch tons of gay-gags. The plot is not important. Too bad, this film contains nothing of this and every line is missing the point. The characters all look the same except for the German gaynigger, one or two jokes, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title made me laugh and I was ready to laugh even more than the movie. My expectation was high apparently.
