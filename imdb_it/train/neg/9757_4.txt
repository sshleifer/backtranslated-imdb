It is not the greatest film to remember Paul Naschy of. <br /> <br /> Gaston (Guillermo Bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman I've ever seen. Zorro would be ashamed! His only salvation came as the competition was equally negative. <br /> <br /> This film is described as adventure and horror. Forget the horror - there is none. No nudity, no blood, no monsters; just an adventure by Robin Hood against an evil baron (Paul Naschy) who wants to become king. <br /> <br /> The film starred Graciela Nilson, who made only four films in two years and lost a regrettable loss. Where she went?
