You know Jason, you know Freddy, and you know Leatherface. Now, get ready for: the assassin of the safety pin! True, in Killer Workout, a stupid and flogging movie, if I've ever seen one, the invisible killer sends his (or her?) Victims with a large safety pin. It's a strange choice, the kind of thing that deserves an explanation. Of course, the film does not even attempt to clarify where the killer has acquired such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, an aerobics gym is besieged by a crazy killer and everyone is suspected. In fact, the film provides so few clues about the identity of the killer, almost everyone in the film is a potential killer until they are killed. And since almost everyone, but the killer ends up dead, it's really just a process of elimination. <br /> <br /> Strangely, as the entire cast of the name is killed, aerobics classes continue in earnest. In reality, nothing can stop the dance. While three men are killed in the next room, the training continues. Death is not even a factor; one character dies, but is still visible in the last training sessions. Director David Prior knew what he was doing when he called the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout. <br /> <br /> Police chases, explosive tanning beds and hundreds of exposed flesh shots of women are launched to a good extent. Just like the woman in the tanning bed, I felt very uncomfortable at the end of Killer Workout. In the end, thankfully, THE END flashed on the screen. What happened next? You understand, shots of working women. Not even the end of the film can stop them! <br /> <br />
