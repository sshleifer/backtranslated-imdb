Within the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die", we have already been subjected to a ridiculous summary and voiceover accompaniment on the first two films, exhilarating acting, about three minutes of footage simply taken from the second film and slightly reworked to look like a new movie, and a long announcement that the character of the scarred and tormented title looks on Universal Theme Parks - Universal is the company that distributed this film. Yes, "Darkman III: Die Darkman Die" is quite manageable when it comes to economic revenue on the success of a previous film. <br /> <br /> This time, the disfigured anti-hero Peyton Westlake ("Darkman", played by the actor "Mummy" Arnold Vosloo), closes his horns with the evil crime lord, the bad husband Peter Rooker (played in a brilliant exaggerated performance by Jeff Fahey), and during 87 the minute film grows to develop an affection for Rooker's wife and daughter, once again learning to take care of another person. <br /> <br /> Blah. Blah. Blah. <br /> <br /> This film is basically just a stupid way for the studio to earn a little more from Sam Raimi's original film, which I consider a great action-suspense movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and there are also a series of stupid partitions, including an evil that presumably was one of the original doctors to save Darkman after his scars, and his seductive hero to think it was a ally before revealing her nefarious plot to help Rooker create other super-human thugs like Darkman. Apparently, he cannot simply do the same procedure with the thugs he performed on Darkman. Why? I can't really explain it, because the film certainly isn't. <br /> <br /> There is also a sub-plot of the assassination involving an Attourney district that is threatening to overthrow Rooker's organization, and some other very silly things are going on. <br /> <br /> But they don't really add up. This film is presented as two or three episodes of a TV show edited together more than a real movie. Directing alternates between good and mediocre (a scene in which Darkman rides his train-like vehicle and dodges a rocket launcher is simply silly), and editing is a mixed bag. The film moves too fast because anyone really cares about what's going on. And without ruining it, the last 15 minutes of this movie, and indeed, the whole series is just a little ... I don't know ... Another 15 minutes of footage with mixed media. <br /> <br /> Actually, commenting on the editing, one of my favorite things in this film is to look at the films reused from the previous films, and then look for films in this film that is repeated several times. Yes, it's so cheap. It's one thing to do a re-cap at the beginning of the film, and maybe repeat one or two, but in pure volume they do it (minutes of repetitive footage from previous films), it's just sloppy and amateur. /> <br /> Also, I have to say that Darkman's extravagant psychedelic montages are a bit exaggerated in this film. They are so stylized and exaggerated that they work, but only in light doses and in the right context, as Raimi did in the original film. Here, there are at least four or five, and they feel very sharp and out of place. <br /> <br /> That said, the film is not without positive points. Some action scenes are well done. The story of Darkman's clich√© that aspires to a real life works properly for a direct function on DVD. Some acting is nice, especially from Rooker's wife, played by the beautiful Roxann Dawson. Also, while there is no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes beautiful music based on the original Elfman themes. <br /> <br /> But overall, the film is too fast, cheap and silly to take seriously. Arnold Vosloo seems alternately bored and exuberant from one scene to another, and Fahey, while a joy to watch as an over-the-top villain, is not quite in line with the series. <br /> <br /> Like "Darkman II", I would recommend it to fans of the original, who will surely have a laugh. Otherwise, it is not necessary to apply. A four out of ten.
