First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> All those of the former Yugoslavia who are not Serbian radical extremists will agree with me. This film shows the Serbian side and only the Serbian side. Serbian crimes were not represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this film was made by the Serbs, so there is no neutrality. All the "professionals" who have been interviewed are not professionals at all. Some read only a book written by a Serbian radical, the other is a denial of the genocide, etc. <br /> <br /> Even the Slovenians have been blamed in this film. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and only because the Slovenians were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the war between Croatia and Serbia). Every Slovenian is outraged by all the accusations in this film. <br /> <br /> Every reasonable Croatian will agree with one thing: independence was too early. Perhaps all the major conflicts could be avoided. However, mentioning the Second World War and some unrelated things was a truly pathetic attempt to justify everything. Let us imagine that the Japanese launch nuclear bombs in Seattle and Washington and that this is justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will not find any evidence of YNA soldier strangled and killed Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the tape with the journalist who said his statements about Serbian civilians near Vukovar were lies. All on the internet. And the director forgot to mention the entire bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now on the Serbian and Montenegrin side - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrins) and we don't talk about the Chetnik movement. In the beginning it was simply a resistance movement. But somehow the director forgot to mention the collaboration with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and the fight against Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but they can all be easily verified. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only some of the charges are true. Every Croatian is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> I think I don't have to mention the denial of the Srebrenica genocide, the genocide that has too many trials. Imagine the film about the Holocaust denial. This film is the same. And according to this film the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo have been bombarded. Every Bosnian Muslim is outraged by this film. <br /> <br /> Somehow the director forgot to mention the brief occupation by the Serbs of a small piece of Macedonian land (FYROM). <br /> <br /> Croats, Slovenes, Bosnians and Macedonians have never entered the Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and have actually begun to believe some things in this film, know that the Serbs have a kind of propaganda that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made their history. So ... <br /> <br /> Even 50% of Serbs will say that this film is "small" extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> And the Serbian radicals are very, very happy with this film (there are about 40% of Serbs who vote for the radicals). <br /> <br /> I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called documentary there is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: get informed before watching this film. After that, you'll laugh at all the pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See real and neutral documentaries on the death of Yugoslavia.
