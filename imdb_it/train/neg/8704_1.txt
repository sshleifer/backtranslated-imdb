In general I like dinosaur movies, but this is pure shit. No script, no dialogue, no acting. And the brave Colonel Rance is trying to prove that he is tough and that his mouth curves like a twin brother, the stupid Proctor of the Police Academy. So this was a complete waste of time (fortunately it's not a waste of money since I watched the movie on TV). And I really can't understand 7 people who voted for it. They must have joked. My advice, if you see this title run from it!
