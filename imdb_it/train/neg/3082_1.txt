Good God, what were they THINKING ?? !!!!!! Here's your warning for the spoiler, although I don't think that really matters. You won't see this piece of junk anyway. <br /> <br /> A handpuppet group chases a group of really stupid people, who do a really stupid hunt to try to kill them, and puppets complicate things by letting them experience their really stupid fantasies. In other words, the whole thing is really stupid. <br /> <br /> KNOW that it must be bad even when Mike and the Bots can't save anything !! And they don't! I know, some of their jokes were funny, like the one to add to the "HIT" sign and the comments of the hand, but, hell, that was pretty sad. <br /> <br /> All I can say is DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE OR CRUD. NOT WORTH YOUR EYES.
