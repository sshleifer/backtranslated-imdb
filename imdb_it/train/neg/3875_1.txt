I've seen a lot of stupid plots in my time, but this is among the worst. After capturing some diseases in space, an astronaut returns to Earth and begins to melt. Then he goes on a rampage, killing people (as he goes beyond me, I just look at them, I can't explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.
