Not appropriate. The PG vote obtained from this film is another huge misstep of the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but does this movie get a PC? Please. Parents are not fooled, bringing an elementary child to this film is a huge mistake. There have been numerous times when I felt uncomfortable not only because humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was totally out of nothing and useless. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and the general appearance of the film are the only saving thanks. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always nice (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too good for a role like this. Children are conditioned actors and shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that made me look and not throw things on the screen. Did I mention that there was a large talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely regrettable. I didn't like Shrek's voice, and I truly believe that now Myers should never get closer to the realm of children's movies. His portrait of The Cat is a slightly attenuated version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if only for one day, to ruin 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of anger and personal conflicts. <br /> <br /> The Cat in the Hat could be the worst movie for children of all time.
