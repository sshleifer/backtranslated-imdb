I saw it recently on an old faded VHS tape, and I remembered it faintly. Looking at it now, it looks fascinating. <br /> <br /> When he was released for the first time, he was recognized by everyone as a parody of going out as a gay teenager. To bring the point home, the mother is seen reading a pocket copy of "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular exit book of the time. David Warner sums it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [= evangelist who hates homosexuals], which is obviously a case of self-detestable repugnance. The list of sight gags and in-game jokes that were included to make sure no one missed the point would have been too long to enter. The producers were having some good-natured fun, and hoping, without a doubt, to light and illuminate. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenage audience would watch this movie today. In some places, where there is education and culture, the terrifying evidence that gay boys have faced is a thing of the past. But I'm sure there are many dark and bad corners of our continent where it's just as bad as ever.
