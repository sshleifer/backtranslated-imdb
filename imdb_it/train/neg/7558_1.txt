whatever you do don't waste your time in this nonsense. movie. A remake that does not need to be told. All those who came out of the theater had the same comments. The worst movie I've ever seen. Save your time and money !!! <br /> <br /> Nicgolas Cage was cycling down the hills, swimming in the murky water and rolling down the hills while being attacked by bees, yet his suit was still perfectly ironed and white shirt until the last scene. <br /> <br /> Despite a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage, the acting was just as incredible as the movie itself. It's amazing how good actors can make such bad films. They don't get a copy of the script first. If you still have some interest in watching the movie, wait for it to come out on DVD.
