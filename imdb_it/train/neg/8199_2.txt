I'm really glad I didn't spend money going to the movies :-). It is nothing but the compilation of elements of a few other classic titles such as The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. Framed in a rather boring and meaningless scenario. I really can't understand what was the purpose of creating this film - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its plot, which is also meaningless. Plus there's nothing to look at - the FX effects seem to be taken from a second-hand store, you've generally seen them all in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby.
