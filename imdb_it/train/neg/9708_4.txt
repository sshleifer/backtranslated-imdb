When theater employees find an old reel of movies, they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead, assuming it's an old preview reel. Unfortunately, it is actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of brainless zombies. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the hatred for this movie. It's a low budget independent production with lots of fields, but it doesn't deserve an "1.1" here on IMDb. It's so funny. It is obvious that filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love for old horror films, and have created a fun tribute to them sprinkled with references and tributes to a variety of them. It has the feeling of things like Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and various others. <br /> <br /> I liked the explanation of how the zombies, even if I'm really hypnotized to think they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead - perhaps unbelievable, but I appreciate the effort of the writers to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the acting was fine, and the story was fun. <br /> <br /> I liked it.
