Not completely off the wall in a good way, but just totally stupid. "Killer Tongue" is a restless mixture of science fiction, horror and alleged comedy. What amounts to is a film without mind and totally inconsistent. There is very little dialogue, mainly due to the fact that the script, if there was one, is complete "scum of tin". I wouldn't even say strange, more like "total absurdity". This film is certain to disappoint, and you have been warned. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this, and if you do, the pungent smell will linger like rotten fish ....................... ... ..................................... MERK
