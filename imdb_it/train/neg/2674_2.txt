Someone had a great idea: let's make Misty Mundae make her R-rated version of Lara Croft - by shooting two pistols not only in skimpy but also topless clothes. It was really a great idea. The problem is that the people who have had it have not been able to find any type of script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "film" that barely reaches the average length by reproducing many of its parts (often in slow motion), and has apparently been shot entirely inside a garage. The attractiveness of Misty Mundae is still evident: it is incredibly pretty and has a natural beauty for the girl next door. However his two co-stars here, with whom he shares a long lesbian scene, are not even remotely close to his league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD consumption it cannot get more than 1/2 to 4 *.
