In addition to the great cinematography of the wonderful James Wong Howe in the battle scenes, this film is a real stinker. <br /> <br /> This is the second film I saw a few days ago directed by Alexander Korda. The first was "Rembrandt" by Charles Laughton. It was so lousy that I turned it off. This I fear is not much better. <br /> <br /> Flora Robson is as ugly as Queen Elizabeth. Perhaps his interpretation of Virgin Queen was good by 1937 standards but when compared to that of a Helen Mirren, there is absolutely no correspondence. In robotic fashion, Robson states his lines. His message of battle for the English troops is so dull in spirit. <br /> <br /> Even a tempting Laurence Olivier can't save this piece of boredom. <br /> <br /> The future wife Vivien Leigh is in a supporting role here and she doesn't actually broadcast anything here. Thinking about it, Scarlett was 2 years later! <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the story with the Spanish Armada is meant to be so boring in this movie.
