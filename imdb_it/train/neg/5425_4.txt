I got Mirror Mirror mainly because there was Yvonne De Carlo (I thought it was fantastic in American Gothic) but unfortunately it didn't have a very important role in this film. Start OK and the pace goes well ... but eventually it starts to get a little boring and boring. This does not mean that this is a boring film, but it is only very average and nothing spectacular. I didn't like the "posession" side and there were no decent gore scenes. Moreover the "main" story was very confusing and the ending does not make much sense. However, I liked the story surrounding the gothic girl and how she took her revenge on her tormentors. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans: it's nothing to get wet.
