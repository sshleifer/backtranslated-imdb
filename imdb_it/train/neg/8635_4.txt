This is definitely not one of Lucio Fulci's best films by any effort of the imagination. The plot is pretty ugly, a millionaire is murdered and his spirit invokes his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I had with this (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) wondered why someone should be interested too? The father is considered a real idiot for everyone he meets (including his daughter who asks to help him), which makes it difficult for anyone to worry about who killed him. But no one really looks at a Fulci movie for a good story, doing it would be like watching a porn for an incredible script and acting. Generally his films try to compensate for this by adding excessive scenes of blood, but even this is lacking in this film. If you are looking for a good Fulci movie, take a look at The Beyond.
