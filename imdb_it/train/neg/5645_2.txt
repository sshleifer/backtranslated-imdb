"I thought I would be locked up in a padded cell and they would have thrown away the key" (so it is a transfixed paralyzed of dialogues from "State of Mind". <br /> <br /> We wonder what traps forest Paula Milne and his co-writer have found the magic mushrooms that they must have eaten, to create this "whodunnit" and bring that waste into our screens. A padded cell should be left available. <br /> <br /> Niamh Cusack did its best (like the other actors) but surely its talent deserves a better vehicle than this: the height of the absurdity has been reached, and this particular "state of mind" is better buried and forgotten, and certainly not only "put in a box and locked in a drawer".
