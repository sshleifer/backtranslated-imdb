It's a good movie for kids who love dogs. It works a little slow at the beginning, but ends if a burst of De Vil. The basic plot is the same as the first film. The positive side of the adult film is the talking bird that thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human being (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and barks like a dog. It's the comedy the film needed most. Watch it in the matinee so you don't have to pay the full price or wait for it to appear on Disney.
