Having just seen this on TMC, it's fresh in my mind. It is obvious that while the minions are stars of stars, in reality they do not manage the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups: Moe, like "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a pair of tramps, so there's not a whole lot of complete teamwork. The love story that feeds the plot is not interesting, the two women are the only ones with acting skills, there is another group of musical minions that is not funny, unless you consider their attempts to be funny to be sadly funny. The music is tiring, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, western western wear is stupid, and there is a large part of the film without minions on the camera. By the way, this is obviously after Curley's first hit, and his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent soon appears in an unaccredited role. I loved everything these guys have ever done, including all the non-Curley things, but this little dogy is pretty crappy.
