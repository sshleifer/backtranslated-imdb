This film was terrible. I spent a very difficult time looking at it all the way. I didn't understand the point of the film. What was the point of this film? The soundtrack was bad, the acting was bad and the story uninteresting. The two main characters of the film were very boring and their dialogue was not interesting. There was no chemistry between any of the cast members. I don't know for sure, but I suspect that most of the actors were the first timers. The film could easily be reduced to about an hour and a half without losing the plot. This indicates how many useless scenes are in the movie. I would have preferred to have a root canal during the two hours of the film. I want those two hours back! If you want to see a fun and entertaining family-friendly movie made by a group of Mormons, look at Napoleon Dynamite instead.
