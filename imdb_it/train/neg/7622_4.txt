One can only assume that Robert Osborne is contractually obliged to express pleasure even in the less attractive films of the TCM library, since this would explain it by extolling the "virtues" of this "fascinating" film during its introduction, when I saw it on TV via cable. Since every old movie on IMDb receives "classic" status from a series of amateur critics, I thought there was a desperate need for a more honest review of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is not your father's "Buy around the corner". For all my quirks with 'You've Got Mail', it is even more striking than this as a remake in every way imaginable. For those who have seen the original, the flaws will be even more evident. <br /> <br /> From one of the cutest sequences in Meet Cute, I can remember seeing (a sad attempt to disgust 'humor'), this film starts on the wrong foot and never really comes back in. This "musical" only qualifies as one in the poorest sense of the word. There is a sprinkling of instantly forgettable musical numbers and then there is Judy singing " I Do not Care "while waving his arms as if in an attack. The Christmas song he sings in the shop is probably one of his best numbers here. Miss Garland has been wonderful in numerous musical films, but here she looks horribly disgusting. role originally had been filled by June Allyson and Judy absolutely not able to fill the old part of Margaret Sullavan. Van Johnson also turns into a rather bland performance as a second-level Jimmy Stewart type. The protagonists never reach the chemistry of Stewart / Sullavan or that of Hanks / Ryan. <br /> <br /> This is a film that knows (some) the notes, but not the music. He doesn't really seem to understand why the original worked and even the need to add another possible love interest for the Van Johnson character to complicate things unnecessarily. Replacing the remake for the infidelity subplot of the original is a weave of plots that involves a priceless violin. It is almost embarrassing to observe and feel as if it had been relieved by an episode of Three's Company by someone with a DeLorean and a flow condenser. It's really just an excuse for a Keaton pratfall. Even the great scene of the resolution of romantic voices is poorly managed. After seeing both films, you will understand why they called it "Lubitsch Touch" and NOT "Robert Z. Leonard Touch". <br /> <br /> Avoid this and review the original movie or that of Judy Garland previous films unless you are an iconoclast who loves to see a once great star fall to earth.
