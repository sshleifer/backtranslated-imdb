The film was made in 1942 and with the World War 11 around, the film industry decided to capitalize on the fact that there were spies around. <br /> <br /> The film is fun to watch thanks to Eleanor Powell's fabulous dances. Miss Powell's disappearance was certainly a great hoofer in every sense. It is again paired with a very young Red Skelton in this place. The two also starred in "I Dood It." <br /> <br /> Moroni Olsen, who 3 years later was superb while the questioning police officer in "Mildred Pierce" appears again as an officer asking Powell to deliver an item. The problem is that Olsen and his thieves are actually Japanese spies. <br /> <br /> Bert Lahr is his usual brilliant ego here and receives broad support from Virginia O'Brien.
