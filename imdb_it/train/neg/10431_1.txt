I loved the first season. The quality decreased a little in the second season, which however had a great center (Pegasus!). The third season was quite original and original and was fine. The fourth season started to go downhill because they never started giving us explanations when we really needed them. What the hell was the Cylon plan? Why were there two Cylon factions? What was the point of Angel-Kara driving the fleet to a devastated Earth-1? What kind of past did the last five Cylons have, and how did they survive, or were they reincarnations? Questions everywhere, answers nowhere. <br /> <br /> And then the end comes. Earth-2 (our Earth) in the past. Then OK. But destroy the fleet?! Give up technology and give up any kind of urban life and spread some thousands of people around the planet ?! It is not just anti-science, it is anti-reason and anti-life. And the philosophy of the show therefore seems to be that humanity is forever trapped in a cycle that goes from naturalistic romanticism to a decadent capitalist society that invented the AI. destructive. ruin everything It is without vision, without hope for a greater future for humanity, and is antithetical to true science fiction. And don't even let me start with angels! Religious claptrap of the worst kind! The last disappointment !! <br /> <br /> All this "all this happened before and it will happen again", it should have been connected to the previous incarnation of the series, not only to the Earth as we know it. Making the new show somehow consistent with the old would have been the definitive trait of genius. Frakkin shame. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10.
