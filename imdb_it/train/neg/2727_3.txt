This strangeness in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not really need to be included as it is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What it does, however, is shine when it is on the screen. The less close movie is just an excuse to show some Warner players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows a promise and it's a pity she didn't become a big star. RUTH ROMAN manages the role of the "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if this was in color. The positions of the Travis Air Force bases with some projections on the back work well. The best thing about the film are some wonderful musical interludes. If you liked THANK YOU to your LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN you will like this.
