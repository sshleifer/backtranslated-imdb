Curiously, Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is little quality evidence in at least two of the scripts, based on this release for "man-in-the-mac" and also "Fade into Murder". <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is no coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman wrote both scripts above (incidentally playing the part of the security guard murdered here). <br /> <br /> This adventure is very rarely exciting and many of the artists simply seem uninterested in the material. The story is rather weakly developed with some long periods of boring conversation. <br /> <br /> Columbo is also shaded by a colleague here (similar to "Last Salute al Commodoro") but the value of entertainment is minimal. To add to this, the characterization of Holmes by Celeste, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughter. <br /> <br /> The script falters to take care of the family's history and the murderer does enough to give Columbo the case, even though there is never a credible discussion of the reasons for his crime. <br /> <br /> Ironically, what appears to be arguably the worst adventure of Columbo produces the funniest moment in the series. Ask a question about a male hairdresser and have a haircut / manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are fun - it's just that Columbo's hair is so well cared for, so he can't afford to pay the bill and then, when he asks a jeweler, he keeps looking in the mirror to admire his hairstyle! /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only decent moment in a script that seems to have been put together in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Only for Columbo completists.
