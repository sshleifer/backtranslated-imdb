I have to admit I'm a big fan of this show, so you have to know how disappointed I was when I saw this movie. First of all, the plot was horrible, I thought it would be something more interesting, like seeing what happened to Arnold's fathers, or something more interesting, but NOOOOOOO, a maniac wants to destroy Arnold's house, among many other places , so many people try to stop it. <br /> <br /> I must admit that the plot was not so bad, but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends make to stop this maniac, they become friends of a spy,; they drive a bus (based on a video game, for God's sake), and worse, they make super-moves on the bus, things that many people had already tried and died, but not Arnold, Gerald and Helga, because they are experts in a video game. <br /> <br /> Honestly, my mother, my sister, I too was really disappointed after seeing this movie, because it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon. I have to admit I liked "Hey Arnold!", It was one of my favorite Nickelodeon cartoons, but after this movie shit, I'm not sure I see "Hey Arnold!" as I used to look at the past. <br /> <br /> Another thing Nickelodeon, with that huge number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple road would explode, I think the whole city could explode with that, oh, and please, if all your movies future of good cartoons will be like this, not making more films, from the critics to the cartoons that were good before. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think this was the worst way to end this show, a good show turned into this shit of the movie.
