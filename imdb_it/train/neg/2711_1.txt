Even if I could overcome the idea that these boring characters were personally witnesses of every Significant Moment of the 1960s (ok, so Katie didn't join the Manson family and no one died in Altamont), this film was still incredibly horrible. I had the impression that the "writers" locked themselves in a room and watched "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and the 60s by Oliver Stone again and again and called it research. A Canadian television critic has defined the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". He was right.
