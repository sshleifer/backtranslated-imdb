"Let me see your tits!" it's not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I come from. I don't want my 6 and 7 year old daughters to think that way or hear about it. I find it sad that Nick has gone too far with this bullshit And then that's what we get, stupid kids who act like stupid adults. I know it's meant to be fun, but consider that there are innocent little innocent girls in K and 1st grade out there who can't wait to see it. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters won't look at him. I'd like to block Nick but I don't have the heart at this point, but if Nick continues to put out this kind of crap I will have to.
