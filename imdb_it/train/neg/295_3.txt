I took this film because I worked in a movie store, so I took free rentals. He arrived, and the cover made everything look good. Hot chick, with a weapon, okay, I'll check it. <br /> <br /> Oh man, bad move. It was so horrible, I spent half the movie looking forward fast to get to nudity, which was minimal. I think MAYBE three scenes of partial nudity. <br /> <br /> Kosher dialogue, disgusting violence, excuses of shoddy characters. I feel bad about putting this film down, because I know it was made on a low budget, but it was also for "Clerks" and became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
