Can fake landscapes ruin an image? You wouldn't think so, but actually for me here. Listen, I have a lot of movies from the classic era and I know more or less what, except for the drivers who drive cars that are motionless in front of a screen, etc. But a lot of hockey business has to do with action scenes. Having a fake scenery, fake mountains and flowers fired after another, seen in "Brigadoon", insults after a while. <br /> <br /> As for musical entertainment, this is always subjective. Which songs one person likes, another doesn't, so it shouldn't be an important part of judging a movie (if someone likes songs). I could make this film explode for its melodramatic 1950s songs, dances, novels and characters, but it was the 50s and many people liked this kind of thing. Musicals did very well in the 1950s. I liked the 30s and 40s with great touches. In the 1950s, the faucet was out and this new stuff - which I can handle - was. Does this make a bad film? No. It makes it just one that I didn't care for much <br /> <br /> Despite the cast, the good director and the great expectations, this film bombed at the box office and with me. I would have liked more, being a dreamer myself and this is a beautiful part of this story. I'm not the cynical type and a beautiful city and the nice people who make me feel good sound awful. So why can't I connect with this movie? In part also dance. I don't care for the things that replaced tap dancing on the screen. But - no - it really blew me away. There was no Scotland, no plateau, just a hokey-looking background to make it look that way and it almost made me from the beginning. Get a point for today's realism where they "go to the place" most of the time.
