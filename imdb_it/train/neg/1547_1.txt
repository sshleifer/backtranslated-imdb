I could name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that are fun and are. Some films, such as a Gymkata, try to be serious but end up being fun. The Ladies Man is a film that desperately tries to be fun, but it couldn't be any less fun if it were a guy who took a lot of chicks in the middle of a nuclear holocaust sinking. It's anti-fun. <br /> <br /> I don't think I laughed more than a little laugh at anything in this movie. It's simply not fun. It's boring, stupid, silly, annoying, incredibly bad, but not funny. I'm not particularly interested in Tim Meadows, or this SNL character, but I expected better. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense completely. It's as if the writer had a bag on his head while he was writing and he couldn't see which keys he was hitting. They say "the origin" of the Ladies Man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre acting fascination as if it were still in the seventies. The film tries to get humor from a man who seems to enjoy porn, shortly after he tried to hang himself. Is this the comedy? I like to consider myself a good sense of humor (spending a lot of time writing comedies like I do), but maybe I'm not brilliant enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as fun as Tucker in There's Something About Mary, is shockingly ugly here. I was praying with him in my head to shut up. <br /> <br /> In the end I was hammering in my chair, muttering under my breath, and if the film were finished, I would probably have tried to commit suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen that comes close. <br /> <br />
