54 is a film about a club with that title in the 70s era set. It features the classic good-looking bartender. The sexy females The high-powered owner. The party. When everything is intertwined, chaos ensues, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be the greatest of all. <br /> <br /> I will be as blunt and honest as possible, avoiding any unfair or false comments (like, it's an "ok" movie). I really find it a completely terrible movie, complimented by the cast. Every time I sit down to watch a movie that plays Salma Hayek, I am always waiting to see its beauty, radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance, but, reality invariably reminds me of how absolutely talented it is. I mean, really, what has he ever left to the masses, besides his immense table dance in "From Dusk Till Dawn" ...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen, but his good looks and his insanely boring facade, otherwise known as "acting". Mike Myers, it's not as bad as these 2, at least it gives the movie something worthy. He plays the sad, outgoing co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that most viewers will hate (ie the job well done), puts in a rather convincing performance that gave me a rare fun from the movie. But alas, it's not enough to save the film from its useless and flat nothing. Most bad "bad" movies I find something to take in the movie, but this one has nothing in it, really. Neve Campbell is not bad, but it's just "there". The plot is boring, it seems that the writer was more determined to make a film with this style and embellishment and forgot to add more. Any meaning Any class Just nothing. Because like most ornaments, they are just empty objects with no points, which are simply beautiful to look at, very similar to the basis of this disastrous film. <br /> <br /> Absolutely an hour and a half that I could have spent doing something much more exciting, like talking to 90-year-old relatives over time.
