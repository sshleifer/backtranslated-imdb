... just look at the poor character of Robert Webber (great show, again!) who tries to fight with a machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this film seems to be a bit wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give action a solid foundation in the reality of the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this film and the most difficult, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando screams? Head down "all the good guys do it and all the bad guys don't make it so that they can shoot at libel (with a good conscience), that the main character is not mowed down by the masked commandos, even if he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal, they seem unlikely and make it difficult to take the film seriously, and it just happens that you try to be more than just funny, an episode of the mirror signal from the toilet ... <br /> <br / > I do not care about the criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield for the criminals and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the assiduous representatives of power in the head of this film, but the political comment is rather disgusting and uninspired, which is regrettable as it the film presents a first performance of Judy Davies, who plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject ". However, his performance is above that of others and somehow I feel the film disappointed him.
