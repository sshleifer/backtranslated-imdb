I know actors and actresses like to try different types of movies - hey, nobody wants to get the typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better than that. "Angels in the Outfield" is another film in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically arrives and saves the day. I also need to tell you how it ends? The film is nothing but pure and simple escape (examples of high escape are the various science fiction films of the 50s). If these films had a political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be OK; this is just useless. Much closer to evil than angelic. Also played by Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suspect they don't want to emphasize this in their resumes.
