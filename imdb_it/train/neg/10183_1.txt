This is a very terrible production. The general consensus has always been that, while Princess Margaret might have been spoiled and pampered and could have fun with the excess of luxury at her disposal, she was a beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress could not understand it. It also seemed that the production budget could not extend to a hairdresser: from the beginning, the hair of the Princess Margaret character had a messy-looking permanent bird's nest and seemed to have been dragged into a bush. The actor who played the Duke of Edinburgh seemed to have prepared for his role by watching Rory Bremner imitate Prince Charles and was farcical. <br /> <br /> Production was a madness ride, a clich√© ridden, embarrassing load of garbage. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
