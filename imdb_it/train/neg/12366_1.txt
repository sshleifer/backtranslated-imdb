"Loonatics Unleashed" is the worst thing that could happen to classic characters created by Chuck Jones. The "Loony Tunes" have many spin-offs and different versions, some are good, others not very. But "Loonatics" is the worst. The concept is stupid and derived from shows like "The Power Rangers" and "Teen Titans". There was no resemblance to the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made. The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic. This show does not work. This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this should be nothing more than a bad joke. Boring ! Zero stars
