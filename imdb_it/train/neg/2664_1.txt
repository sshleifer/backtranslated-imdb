An unpleasant and clich√© thriller has a young couple researching various murder sites in America, becoming a fellow traveler with a dark young woman and her snarling boyfriend - who is a real psychopath. Arty and alienating, the tone of the film alternates between sulky pseudo-irony and opulent fantasy. Tightly done maybe, but eventually laughable. Brad Pitt's performance as a low-cost killer is crazy. * from ****
