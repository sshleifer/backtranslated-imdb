This film is noteworthy for three reasons. <br /> <br /> First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two "Superman" serials, this low-budget film was made and distributed in cinemas, marking George Reeves and Phyllis Coates initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. Outside the city of Silby, a six mile deep oil well enters the "Empty Land" allowing the "Mole-Men" to come to the surface. Forget the other holes (those in the plot). <br /> <br /> Secondly, unlike most of the SF invasion films of the 1950s, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) role in the preaching and application of tolerance and acceptance of difference against an angry mob of segregationist vigilantes. No "mild journalist" here! Clark Kent, well-informed and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout ("I'll take care of this!"), Even witnessing in a hospital gown removing a bullet from a Mole-Man! Like Superman, he is kinder than Clark to the feverish Lois, but he is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he lashes out at the vigilantes as "Nazi assault troops". <br /> <br /> Third, you will notice that the transition from the animated flight of Superman to Fleisher cartoons in the two serials to the "live action" flying in the "Adventures of Superman" had not yet been done.
