I have nothing else to say but it was terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if some actors don't want people to question their sexuality, then maybe they should refrain from doing more of these films. There was at least one that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER thinking about what was happening was cut from the film. SHUDDER wondering what happened to the minds of the actors who made this film. Shudder at the thought of the thought process and voyeurism that went on in the minds of the directors. As I said before, it's a degrading mess. It's not even funny. As Ebert said of the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, it's not a good story and it's not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
