I don't particularly like remakes, or to steal the "jargon" of modern jargon, but this movie really drove me crazy. The original Prom Night, though not in my humble estimation of a masterpiece, still realized what it was ... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror movie. Suspense is essential to maintain public interest. Sorry folks, but this was not a white knuckle film! The fears were economic and foreboded terribly. (A good example of fear that was made due to excessive clichés now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed immediately afterwards, but an apparently unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) out, so how could I expect it to meet the other conventions of the horror film. There must be a nice hero or heroine. This film does not have one. The person I most identified with was the main detective. His calm attitude, but the approach at street level for a killer escape was what other films of this type should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you are running away from a psionic who is armed with Ax, he turns you and snaps in the opposite direction. Don't run, while you look back three seconds, tracing the killer's progress, only to stumble over every branch and inanimate object on your path.) your friend disappears, don't go looking for them yourself. And if you suspect you are playing badly, tell someone, do not investigate yourself. These clichés are tired and exaggerated. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.
