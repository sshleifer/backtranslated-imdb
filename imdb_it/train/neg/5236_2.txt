my friends and I saw this movie about a week ago and feel absolutely necessary to tell the whole world (or at least those who read this) that this film is not only among the top five worst movies I've ever seen, but in reality has the honor of being number one. I've seen a lot of movies, but nobody beats him stupid. you could say that I suffered looking at it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting a few hours and we couldn't go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks. I don't recommend it to anyone at the beginning I thought we were watching a really bad porn movie, but after 10 minutes we didn't succeed. it's not a comedy, it's not drama, it's not action, it's not horror, it's just awful!
