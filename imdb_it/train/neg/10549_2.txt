The film industry is a complicated business, because decisions have to be made and the people involved have a private life too. This is the very original thesis of this weak attempt to make a "perceptive" film about the film. And indeed, no better evidence than the delicacy of the industry to see Anouk Aim√©e and Maximilian Schell trapped in this inanity. The intuition consists of talking heads that shit like "should I make a movie in the studio that pays a lot or should I create an indie object and stay true to my artistic self?" "Do the second one, please." Or: "our relationship is not only professional, it's private. It's a rather complex situation to manage, isn't it?" "Yes, it is, my dear." Among the tasteless dialogues, glimpses of palms, hotel lobbies and American film posters can be glimpsed (no sign of non-American films on the Croisette). Recurrent sleep sessions are inevitable, making the 100-minute movie like years. Jenny Gabrielle is spectacularly unconvincing in justifying her presence in the frame.
