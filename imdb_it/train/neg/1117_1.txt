I don't know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it's always dark, except for a few seconds a day. There are long interrupted shots of insects of all kinds for no reason. That little dialogue in the film is as foolish and meaningless as the images. A black woman enters the apartment of the main character. Somehow she gets pregnant during the night, then gets hit in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a naked white woman emerges. I've never been so upset about how bad and useless a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to look at him so he could tell me what they think. But I wouldn't want this level of hell to anyone else.
