One might think that a film about whether a young person is dealing with his nascent homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is ten times more powerful than any sleep aid on the market. It's almost as if the director * considered * making a film, but he became lazy and decided instead to run a series of random images (and casually BORING) and scenes anywhere, insert a couple of real scenes with acting, pretend that a good lighting is not important in the film production process, and wrapping it under the auspices of an "author" film. This is exactly a poor type of product that makes it easy for many traditional film producers to hum the movement of independent films, and that allows the public to more easily embrace independent films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in films that deal with this topic, you will be much better attuned to some of the great short films available on the Logo website or by renting Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this lengthy piece of dreck.
