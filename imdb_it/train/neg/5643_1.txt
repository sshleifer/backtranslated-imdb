I own 2 home entertainment stores and have seen many bad movies in my day, but this was so bad that it forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III compared to that of Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover just died a month before her arrival at the "Rubber House" he had given her. Once there, she discovers she has betrayed her throughout her relationship, but none of them seems to register with her. Within a day, he begins a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the house keeper. Even though she is married to Dafoe off screen, her scenes with him were cold and emotionless. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe could save this film from the amateur film disaster that it is.
