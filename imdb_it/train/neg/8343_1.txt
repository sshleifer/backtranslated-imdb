Rescue is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing remotely horrible about it. It does not deserve to be in such a beautiful genre. First of all, I don't see how so many people can think of this piece of shit as such a beautiful film. If I wrote something boring and completely ridiculous, I would be mocked and too embarrassed to subject others to stupidity. Second: the acting is terrible and the leading actress is terribly ugly. Third: the story sucks, has been used before, and the excuse that it is an economic film is not an excuse. Read the summer at the back of the case, reveal the whole story. I don't recommend watching this movie if you don't have 80 minutes to waste on something that will leave you regretted seeing it. I feel really bad for those Crooks and the irony of their name. Everyone greets Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
