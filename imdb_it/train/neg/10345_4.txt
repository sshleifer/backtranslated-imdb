In 1941 Columbia was an important studio in its own right and could produce a film with the same technical aspect as MGM, Paramount or Warners. This is the best thing that can be said about "Adam Had Four Sons", a lead soap opera with nearly terminally bland performances by Ingrid Bergman (top-billed for the first time in an American movie) and Warner Baxter. Bergman plays a Frenchwoman (this was the time when Hollywood thought a foreign accent was as good as another) hired as a housekeeper for Baxter's four children and stayed up (with an interruption caused by the stock market crash of 1907) until boys are not grown men who serve during the first world war. Almost everyone in the film is so good-good is it a relief when Susan Hayward enters mid-way? she is the only watchable person in the film even though she is clearly channeling Bette Davis and Vivien Leigh; is he also the first in his long series of alcoholic roles? but the script remains sweet and the ending is absolutely absurd. It is no wonder that Bergman rejected the similar plot of "The Valley of Decision" four years later.
