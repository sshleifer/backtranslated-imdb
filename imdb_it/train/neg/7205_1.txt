If you like to see what needs to be started as a 2-hour movie in unconnected gusts of unwatchability, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, you may be wondering how they could have made a film like that from something as simple to translate on the big screen as the Inspector Gadget. <br /> <br /> In the film premieres many scenes were shown that were not in the film, and within the film, some scenes make no sense. While the film is just under 1.5 hours, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, and this is only before or during the closing credits! <br /> <br />
