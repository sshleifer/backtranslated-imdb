This film was written very badly. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a film about this. My 11-year-old son could write a better screenplay than Hyung-rae Shim's. <br /> <br /> The only actor who did not suck was the zoo guard. He was the only amusing and credible lottery. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this was up there on my list of lame at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those of you who thought it was a good movie, you seriously need brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the film were not even dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
