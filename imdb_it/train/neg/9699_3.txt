Despite what many other people thought of the first film, I really liked it. This though. How to sum it up in one word?: This film is (and here comes the word): CRAP! <br /> <br /> But let's look at it one after the other: Here is the plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has other problems: The Court-Jester, father of his son, he went astray, like the super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, to fight his gray hair and sells the real progeny for some blond and full hair. In her desperation Snow White seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees), who must first find the other six dwarven companions and then try to find the real offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot seems to have been written over a weekend, where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the script. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are good jokes. Even for the fans of the first part, or for the fans of none of the other actors, it is not really worth buying the DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> The only thing, which at least saves the film from complete oblivion, are the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all together manage to make up for the bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at some point, they even cross into our reality, and unfortunately ... they do nothing funny while I'm here. <br /> <br /> Again, many great actors in this film: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Particularly fun): RÃ¼diger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and many but unfortunately all these comedians are not able to give life to this really bad script. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a pleasure for some hardcore fans, but it's not worth it for regular movie-goers or renters or DVD buyers. <br /> <br /> I even regret having rented the movie.
