Another almost forgotten Poverty Row movie of the 1930s, revived by the magic of DVD. <br /> <br /> Performed by Lionel Atwill (often a supporting actor in numerous Frankenstein films) as a pair of twins involved in a racket murder. One kills the victims (exchange agents involved in a scam) and asks the witnesses for the correct time, while the other is deaf and is shown "innocent" because he could not have spoken to witnesses. <br /> <br /> Of course, where it falls apart if it were a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? Oh good. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a good job here, pretending to be deaf and dumb. Unfortunately, no one else here can really act worthy of the damn thing.
