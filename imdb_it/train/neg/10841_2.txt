It was all that it was not: it had rhythm, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew the scenery. He also had a decent script. This made me scratch my head. If Farrah isn't really "serious" about a career, why does he have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists", why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the movie "Brady Bunch" in which Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare, only to find himself on BB)? They weren't industry names, but they weren't starving either. And while they got the right story (the poster was published before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejected the steps for "Funny Home Video" and "American Idol" and Spelling promises his little girl Tori that she will one day create a show for her it obviously didn't happen. <br /> <br /> What bothered me was how the Spelling role is distorted. It is shown as the show runner and the creator when he was neither. And as "coming out" with the idea for CA it was ridiculous! <br /> <br /> How did Spelling and Goldberg allow Farrah's oral contract to be enforced when the others were signed? And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein say he was leaving because he hadn't discovered his Inner Diva, but why did Majors want her to do it? This is why, when he tries to create conflicts and tensions by setting Farrah as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), he fails because the foundations have never been laid - that was where the picture of "Three's Company" was delivered .
