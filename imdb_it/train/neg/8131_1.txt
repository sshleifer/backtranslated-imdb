Unless the title is a sort of spoiler for the transformation of the wife (the demons! Ruining it for us). In any case, if this film were not Made-For-TV, it should have been, it is so extraordinarily low budget, undersized, undervalued and affects all the 70's clich√©s except the disco. No one is nice, and you could yawn what happens to anyone in this. Eminently forgettable except for bad, bad performances.
