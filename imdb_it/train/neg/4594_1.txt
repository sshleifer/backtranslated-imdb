I have had numerous problems with this film. <br /> <br /> Contains some basic information on quantum mechanics, which is fine. Although quantum physics has been around for over 50 years, the film presents this information in a grandiose way that seems to say: "You are not simply blown away by this!" Well, not really. These are no longer shocking revelations. However, I was already familiar with quantum theory and the fact that particles must be described by wave equations, etc. It is not new. <br /> <br /> The main problem I have with this film, however, is the way these people use quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for mysticism and spiritualism. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spiritualism, but quantum mechanics really has nothing to do with these things, and should be kept separate. The people who interviewed for this film start with the ideas of quantum theory and then jump to say that by simply thinking of something you can change the matter around you, so we should think positively in order to have a positive impact on the world and improving our lives The reasoning is completely ridiculous and the conclusions do not follow logically from quantum theory. For every so-called "expert" who interviewed for this film, there are dozens of physical theorists who would completely disagree. They rightly point out that the unpredictability of the subatomic world does not support mystical notions about our spiritual connection. <br /> <br /> It troubles me that people will see this movie and eat it completely because it leaves them with a good positive feeling. The main thrust of the film is based on a total misinterpretation of quantum theory, and is just as bad in its reasoning as any attempt to justify organized religion with similar pseudo-scientific arguments. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yes. At one point, one of the "experts" states that since most of the assumptions people have made about the world over the course of history have proven to be false, so the hypotheses we are currently discussing about the world are also false. Eh? This totally does not follow. And even if it did, I don't see how that helps his argument. I mean, if his ideas became common assumptions, I suppose we should assume that they too are false, based on his own reasoning.
