I thought this movie was pretty lame. If you're looking for cheesey, you might like it. I, myself, don't mind a good amount of cheese, but this was ridiculous. The progression of the film bored me and the plot was very weak. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing about this movie was the zombies of the day, but even this is not enough reason to watch this movie.
