It looked like a really interesting blurb movie. Nazis, occult, government conspiracies. I was expecting a low-budget Nazi version of the DaVinci or Ragazzi code from Brazil or even the shockwaves. Instead you get something completely different, more psychological, more like David Lynch's. This was actually an advantage. But the way the plot is told is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the casting. The character of Andrienne Barbeau starts the movement being a little shy and scared. He doesn't do it very well, even at his age, although he certainly tried. The actor chose the role of the son apparently thinking that it was a comedy. Even most of the other actors seemed to have thought it was a camping film, or at least behaved that way, rather than just being bizarre. The only one I thought was really good was the daughter, Siri Baruc. <br /> <br /> Another important part is the rhythm. Start very slowly. So slowly you might be tempted to turn it off. But then it becomes irresistible for a while when you arrive at your daughter's suicide and the next day. But soon after, everything becomes a confused mess. A part of this was on purpose, but much of it was just unnecessarily confusing, monotonous and unfocused. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that it is not simply a film that is pleasant to watch. It's slow, boring, none of the characters is nice. Excessive use of images and sets. Some movies you see characters are tortured. In this, it is the viewer who does it. It has some gruesome moments, especially the gruesome Nazi paintings and the end credits, but the rest of the film is mostly annoying.
