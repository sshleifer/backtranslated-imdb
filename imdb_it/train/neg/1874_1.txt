I have been a fervent supporter of Hal Hartley since I saw his short film "Surviving Desire" in high school, and even then he was still completely uninhabited by his eye-catching brilliant "Henry Fool". But this 10-year follow-up is not only unnecessary, it's shameful. <br /> <br /> After a fickle and rapid start, "Fay Grim" turns into pseudo-intellectualism, flat out boredom and finally unjustified - and unwanted - nihilism. And this is just the plot. <br /> <br /> Most of the new faces are frivolous and poorly developed like the movie: a particularly flat character ends up making half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and it's his only scene spoken in the movie! <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum's Fulbright agent, apparently, is the only brilliant character (a pun intended by Hartley). How, then, goes away? ** SPOILER ** Dead due to a car bomb, making it easily the most violent film of Hartley, the most violent to date, and tonally all wrong in a film that is already all wrong from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention the same Fay ... well, I won't ruin their destiny, because the film does a job good enough of it all (when not busy with yet another distressing inclination, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving from Auteur to a lousy film student). <br /> <br /> This piece is a complete mess, a terrible mess that isn't even witty enough to have fun in its confusion. Instead he self-indulgently satisfies his director's typical hipster claims in the "real world", uglier and meaner than necessary, but not ugly enough or petty enough to get close to having something to say. In this way, Hartley keeps track of all my memories of these people and the wonderful world he created for them. <br /> <br /> I have rarely been so depressed in the cinema, and I'm counting "Leaving Las Vegas," which at least has developed new characters, we fell in love before destroying them, instead of immediately ignoring the already loved characters. "Grim , indeed.
