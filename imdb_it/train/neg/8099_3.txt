This was a great book and the possibilities for a really great movie were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely destroyed the film. Hanks is certainly a great actor, but he does not have the ambiguous and morally ambivalent characteristics necessary for the main role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. <br /> <br /> Putting Melanie Griffiths in, for reasons of nonsense, is understandable, but again, it didn't represent depth or ambivalence, so it's necessary to remove it. /> <br /> This film is a great example of how any decision, even the initial ones in the production of the film, can make or break a file.
