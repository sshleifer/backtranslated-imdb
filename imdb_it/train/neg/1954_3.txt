First off, let's get out of the way. . . yes, this movie steals a lot from "Darkness Falls" (2003). The plot of 'Darkness Falls' is something like this: The Tooth Fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face from disfigurement kills people who look at her for revenge. In "The Tooth Fairy" (2006), the brazen Tooth Fairy (who, yes, hides her face) unleashes his furious revenge on just about anyone. A little too similar to be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> But what needs to be asked is this: if you want to directly steal the exact plot of a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'Darkness Falls'? Sure, he made a few dollars at the box office, but it was strictly for the pretty good theatrical experience that the film had delivered. A low-budget movie directed at the video will not have the same effect. And it is not so. <br /> <br /> As I watched the opening 15-20 minutes of the film, my expectations actually increased. There seemed to be at least some production value. The story did not seem terrible, but simply ripped off. After the first scene, we get a cast of characters including a former doctor with secrets (played by that guy who looks like a Busey) and a hot veterinary student (Jenifer of "Masters of Horror: Jenifer" by Argento). After those few minutes, however, the film slowly goes down the drain. All the horrible basic clich√©s are needed, including, for example: a crazy old man with an unheard warning, the silent buff, the psychic and the stripper with a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems with this film was its inability to stay with a target audience. It's kind of like if the directors wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on the screen at the time. When the adults were on the screen, he looked more mature. When Star (the stripper) and whatshisface (the jock) were on the screen, the dialogue was reduced to a more stupid, wrong and immature level. When the child was on the screen, it looked like an episode of "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" . . just less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is everywhere. Images vary from pretty good to boring boring. The writing is poor, as is acting for the most part. On the plus side, there is a little bit of gore in some parts (including a rather interesting (but painfully predictable) woodchipper scene and a rather ferocious nailgun scene, and if you're looking for some sexy stuff, there is a short topless scene (but if you want to see this topless girl, there are better films to do it.) Besides this, there is not much to worry about when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of "Darkness Falls" (is there one?), Maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way ... but, that's the only reason I can find this . <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 3/10 -AP3-
