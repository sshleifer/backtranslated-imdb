"People I Know" is a clunker with no one to cheer on and no one to worry about - despite the efforts of a talented cast. <br /> <br /> Pacino offers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman, an advertising agent who came to power, carved out by a life of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, in his dilemma or in his destiny. <br /> <br /> The film traces Eli's preparations for a benefit to a liberal political cause, while being distracted by a customer (Ryan O'Neal, good at a signed part) the last "dirty laundry" - in this case, a companion of television actresses who has been involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual star power to this supporting role, even if, again, the script doesn't give her much to work on. Like Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to arouse sympathy despite the implausible plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This film is strictly for those who like to watch Pacino trudge and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately, between the script and the direction, "People I Know" is strictly amateur. Hence its limited output in cinemas and the rapid journey on DVD. Consider yourself warned.
