Repetitive music, annoying narratives, terrible cinematic effects. Half of the plot seemed centered on the shock value and the other half seemed focused on placating the kind of crowd that would torment people to start a fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in the "deleted scenes" section, the one in which he is in the office of the principle with his mother. I don't understand why they cut it. The film seemed desperate to make a point on everything he could and Domino talk about sororities would have been a highlight of the film. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous photographic work is reminiscent of MTV, and is not absolutely necessary or useful for a film. just to skip a lot of things and rotate the camera around something that repeatedly got old the first time it was used. It's like the directors wanted to use all this extra footage they didn't want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? This should have told me not to watch it from the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for the "in" crowd.
