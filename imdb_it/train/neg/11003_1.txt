How do I start? This film is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has no redeemable qualities. I sat in this movie and it was a struggle. He couldn't get even a single smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that anyone gave this horrible movie. I felt that this film was a failed attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing that was worth this film was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure this is why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I will end it while I try to forget the time I just wasted on this piece of shit. I'll leave you with this warning. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM, IT SUCKS.
