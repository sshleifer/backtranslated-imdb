Considering how much money was allocated for this film, one would expect more from the story as a whole. This could be probably the most useless film I've ever seen. There was no real advancement of anything. Character development, minimum. Plot progress, perhaps. Nice to meet you, nobody. I'm not sure what points you are trying to make. If you want to see a movie where the terrorists are a little good guys, the American CIA bombards everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all the capitalists are corrupt and you like to see something that looks like a storyboard development accompanied by a death. For those of us who realize that we don't want to kill a good guy to make a point, we'll limit ourselves to other films. Summing up, this was a horrible attempt at an "Ocean-style" movie like hide-the-plot-so-person-have-to-think, because not only don't you know what's going on, not even those the film. Home Alone 3 was a better movie piece.
