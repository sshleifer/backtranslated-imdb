After the defeat of the first Sleepaway Camp, who thought that a franchise could be born. SC II is of superior appearance. More inspired and much more fun kills. Although it might not say much (compared to the first film), Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Pros: Funny, don't take yourself too seriously as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: acting and mullet abound. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
