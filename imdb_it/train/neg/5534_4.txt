I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 movie collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the films in the set. I'm watching them with my future seven-year-old daughter, which makes most of these movies a riot of laughter. <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after seeing White Zombie, which is really the forerunner of so much that is the mainstay of zombies in the cinema (think of Clive Barker's Serpent and the funeral scene of Live and Let Die by Rainbow and James Bond, NOT Night of the Living Dead). <br /> <br /> However, even if the title includes the word "zombie", it is little more than a love triangle, involving the anthropologist Armand Louque, who is in love with Claire Duval; which in turn is taken with his partner Clifford Grayson. What a yawn, my daughter fell asleep halfway through. <br /> <br /> I had a real difficult time to decipher for those who worked - the allies or the axis; but, I guess it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this film; but, of course, those were his eyes (from White Zombie) that acted as a mind control device for the zombies.
