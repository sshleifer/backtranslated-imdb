This is one of those films that you think producers would refuse to publish because it's so terrible. Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless publicity and would think that they are entertainment because it is amusing crap. What is it with the talking machine with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M's and Skittles? There was no talking car in the cardboard. (Dr.) Claw should be bad, not handsome and charming. Why anyway Rupert Everet 'Claw'? Were the drug writers when they wrote these scenes? It seems they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with the transformation of a man into a criminal-fighting Android thing. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, I don't get a refund. I'm sorry I saw more than 30 minutes of that pile of shit. After I was told the non-repayment policy, I decided to look at the rest of the horrible garbage called the Inspector Gadget.
