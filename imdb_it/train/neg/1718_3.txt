I've read some books on Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, as its costumes and clubs echo the band's real photographs. The death of Buck Barrow and the capture of his wife Blanche is particularly well done. This actress looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche in mourning for her dying husband. However, this film is still from Hollywood, and our anti-heroes remain beautiful until the end, even after being hit by holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before their famous ambush, and he didn't look like a lively cheerleader at the time of his death). The script is boring and the acting is poor, especially the leads. Very disappointing. Attack with Beatty and Dunaway. Theirs may not be "the real story", but it is a great film.
