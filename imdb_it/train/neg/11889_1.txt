Very fun to watch "Beretta's Island" as a kind of natural trash film. It's like an answer to the kind of movie by Jess Franko. Bodybuilders react (face to face!) To drug dealers. The strike very, very, very stupid! : incredibly bad direct fire scenes (shooting) seem even better than melee combat. Ridiculous scenes. Beautiful scenes of incredibly stupid beauties. The erotic scenes are very unerotic. The main fortune of the film is the beautiful scenery and scenes of the festival. t miss: Arnold Schwarzenegger's line at the beginning of the film and Franco Columbu's list of relatives at the end. Special attraction: naked breast. Forgotten plateau - Franco sings!
