... although for a film that seems to try to sell itself like a horror movie, there was a distinct lack of blood. <br /> <br /> There was also a clear lack of directing, acting, editing and script-writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London played one of the scariest performances I've ever seen - his "descent into the maelstr√∂m" of madness is painfully aware of itself and clumsy. Oh watch it contractions! Oh watch him drink strong alcohol! Oh watch him raise his forehead and tilt his head to a playful corner! Oh look at his dark greasy and dark hair! Oh listen to his affected voice! Must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh yes, the poet's shirt comes out - it's another guy who thinks he's Byron. (O Poe.) Oh, for the love of ... someone gave this guy a manual on "How To Act Good" or they just pulled it out of a cardboard box somewhere, the little plastic toy who retired to a discontinuous brand of bargain-bin cereal. Ok, it was a stupid joke - but it's only because the London performance melted my brain with its terrible beauty. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is pretty and very rosy, but this film has yet to grow in her acting shoes - she made her lines as if she were being held back, in fact, her whole performance was very wooden, the her stiff poses like her jokes - who knows, maybe she was just reacting and trying to neutralize, Jeremy London was stirring excesses, but if that's the case, she takes it too far. <br /> <br /> Remarkable is Arie Verveen in the role of Poe - while the role of her character is confused, she offers the best performance of the piece. He simply seems fair, but it is more than that - he has a kind of depth, I believed he had a life beyond the sad two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. Huh, maybe it's just because I like Poe, so I could just let my mind wander and invent while it was on the screen - whatever, it had an otherwise missing factor of interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: the lively blond best friend who is a bit agitated; the local policeman hit who is a bit stupid; the oldest protective man who perhaps has too much not paternal interest in our heroine; the old intriguing witch, etc. etc., yawn, yawn. <br /> <br /> As in the case of the "net lack of blood for a horror film", none of the themes they mention (and that the London character mentions - so keenly - in his attack on Poe's script) are followed by above. As another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - really shocking stuff, but instead they move away from problems, and cut off the violence (a lifted candlestick that swings in the air - approaches the victim - then --- cut in black! This is normal in a traditional Noirish horror, indeed, is expected, and is greeted with affection when it happens: it is a dear convention, especially if accompanied by fake lightning and intense makeup for Siouxie eyes - but in 'Descendant' it appears simply clumsy, or as if the publisher had had the last minute nausea and cut him off.) This may have been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis / disappointment / madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher film: try to be both, or neither (something new and exciting!), but in both cases it fails unpleasantly The only horror element of this whole film is the sontuos epic entity. <br /> <br /> I think the editor (if there was one) must have been drunk when he cut this thing to pieces - there are discouraging foreshortening scenes; scenes that seemed out of order (but that could only be the poor script). Similarly, the director and director of photography - there were some very strange shots and shots that I think should be tribute to Hitchcock or Browning, but I ended up looking silly (again, well in a noir, but this was looking for to be something else.) <br /> <br /> Maybe the whole thing was fun (so the previous reviewers mentioned: "OMG how was it done?!?") if I was in the mood of some bagged sausages, unfortunately for me I had settled on the couch, with the low lights, with the explicit intention of scaring me foolishly - this is a very poor film, and I fear I cannot recommend it to people, not even for laughter. <br /> <br /> Please, please, do not waste your time or money on this - or borrow a real horror / thriller movie, or find a copy of Poe's fantastic stories, either way, you We will have a much more pleasant and frightening night than you can ever hope to get with this junk.
