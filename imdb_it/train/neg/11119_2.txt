Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes come together as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, everything looks fine. Leave plenty of room for a good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in the many boring successive minutes of this pathetic attempt at a movie. This film became redundant, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I couldn't wait to see him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance" I came to the conclusion that he should stay playing stupid country bastards that bartendano. His acting was boring and poor in the film. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I liked the films with Perez in the past, but I decided that the reason I enjoyed other jobs in his career was that he wasn't a main character and didn't have many lines (Do the Right Thing). But now in White Men Can not Jump a central character has been created with many lines, which means that the audience has to put up with his incredibly annoying and whining voice. So after seeing this movie (a term roughly used) and listening to Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated I can now say that I'm a white man and I'm getting ready to jump. . . outside a twenty-story apartment building.
