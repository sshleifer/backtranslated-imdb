Don't get me wrong, the film is beautiful, the shots are beautiful and the material is dramatic. However, it was a huge disappointment and I was actually very upset with what Disney had done. <br /> <br /> The planet Earth of the BBC was all this and more. It was thin. He had a general feeling of balance and showed the complete circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. He was balanced. <br /> <br /> Changing the Land of Disney is none of this. They tried to make a film of which we Americans would talk. DRAMATIC did it. They put in a superior musical score to scare us. They have made predators bad. They made WALRUSES wicked. They showed each meeting as negative. He tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the balance lesson. The film was an hour and a half of negative portrait and only about 10 minutes of positive. <br /> <br /> They are all to prevent the global warning, but this was above the stakes on top of politics and the environment. <br /> <br /> This is another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but I was disappointed with the image quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like that and get the whole picture, go buy, rent or borrow the Planet Earth series from the BBC. They are better lessons, better sound and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
