Why else would you do this to me? <br /> <br /> Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce successful films. Or even decent films. I've seen Lois and Clark, I'm aware of how ... "good" Dean Cain is. <br /> <br /> Obviously this will be a cheese film, and every cheese film has its own special way of making you scratch your head. I won't call these spoilers because you can't really ruin this movie any more than it already is. <br /> <br /> For starters ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? <br /> <br /> Why is a scientist from Chicago and that other scientist is from Los Angeles and no one could be more oriental if they tried? How hard would it have been to get or an American actor, or just change that lame status sheet that the film gives us to say that those people are not American? <br /> <br /> Why are there 2 occasions when the film gives us a snail line? We will have the day of the heliport and then the canteen one day later. And then it's all, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared even when they mentioned it, but I guess it's beyond the point. <br /> <br /> Does a film really improve if you can see it through multiple split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> That dragon surely can walk along that corridor ... beyond ... and beyond ... and beyond ... and beyond ... <br /> <br /> Who has ever been responsible for one of the worst endings in the history of cinema? He was directly out of scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... tell me, do you want to have dinner? Sure, but not in a Chinese place .... with Dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HAHAHA !! HAHAHA! I was a Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> vanishes to black <br /> <br /> my god, it made me shiver it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never fear ... even if the whole building has exploded ... and no one has been left alive ... for some reason there is a second intact and unmanned laboratory who survived quite well, so they can make a sequel. Hooray all of us. <br /> <br />
