This film is a mixture of clich√©s of recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly aiming to end up with an obsessively ambiguous film, what he had was a confusing mess. The protagonist Daniel Wu does a good job but without a central theme it seems that he doesn't have much to do with. Furthermore, the film is largely free of fright (although, in all honesty, there are some gruesome moments between fatigue). <br /> <br /> * SPOILER MILD * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, confusion of identity, death of wild apes, oedipal conflict , abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality and connections of criminal gangs. The only real commonality shared by these elements seems to be to induce the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this film is that, despite the death of his brother by the monkeys that are strongly present on the DVD cover, the act itself is never represented directly. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be a repertoire of monkeys - not very scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an excellent psychological and ambiguous horror story, watch the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
