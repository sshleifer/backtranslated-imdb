In fact, the use of the bat swarm escort documentary used by THE BAT PEOPLE is among the most effective ever. There are shots of swarming bats hanging from cave ceilings, bats that swarm out of caves or swirl near the mouths of caves. This alone is enough to be scary: imagine all of them crawling after you? And they actually swarm in what should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened about forty minutes long, an exaggeratedly exhilarating sequence where a swarm of bats seems to attack a police car, splashing like bloody eggs on the windshield. The problem is that this sequence takes place about fifty minutes late to save the film, most of which consists of one or more people running, screaming, waving their arms to babble excitedly about a poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation. <br /> <br /> The fear is that it comes down with anger, which actually sucks, so their vacation is ruined, because the synopsis of the plot at the top of the reference page of THE BAT PEOPLE really shows up . So here's an effective summary of the film: a young couple goes on a romantic vacation that is ruined when the boy is bitten by a bat. They bravely try to turn it off, but he starts to rave, trying to convince those around him that he is a little more involved in anger, that he can't control himself, and that everyone should KEEP AWAY. <br /> <br /> Now, when someone is foaming at the mouth, covered in sweat, with eyes stunned like one of the less expensive Muppets and shouting at you to get away from me, you move away from him. Don't try to give him drugs, don't try to tell him you love him, give the boy his space, go home and try that scenic vacation next year. <br /> <br /> But no, the people in this movie all act like idiots, they insist on bringing the boy to the limit, and he turns, turns into a pip-like creature part-man party, and kills a group of non-essential secondary characters. There is nothing wrong with this, but the film forgets that it is a low-budget Creature Feature and tries to be a kind of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, there are a lot of people running around trying to convince this guy to take a cold pill, and eventually run off to the hills with a much more humane look than they should have, people insist on trying to chase him and pay the expected price. <br /> <br /> The main thing that goes wrong with the film is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty best, and the film should have been about the guy AFTER he had turned into a bat person, rather that in the journey there. It takes eighty minutes to really take on that front, with some interesting sketches of characters along the way involving the ever-entertaining Michael Pataki in the role of a policeman who has lost his morale, and the late Paul Carr as a doctor friend who the message is not enough. <br /> <br /> The film is terribly boring, about fifteen minutes too long and has lost the opportunity to be a nice and forgettable Creature Feature on a runaway mutant like the horror favorite by Italians RATMAN, which I have seen today and was sadly inspired to try this after seeing it. Me and my brilliant ideas, even if the scene with the police car was a screamer: Too bad we couldn't have had another twenty minutes of that. <br /> <br /> 3/10
