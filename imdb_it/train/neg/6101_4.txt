Almost a two-player game, and as such the dialogue and performances of the protagonists will be important. Nor are they particularly good. This could have been stronger, in fact, if it had been created for the first time as a two-player game, and then worked in a film. <br /> <br /> However, a nervous vampire who seems slightly autistic will become infatuated with a stripper (as a result of watching too much porn in his lousy house). He wants you to tell him about the light of day. It would have been better to find someone with a day job, or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they might not have a warm body. <br /> <br /> After he has brought her what he wants (and he is not so good), he intends to feed on her at 6 am, at which point the sun rises. Much is made of that deadline, despite the fact that he also says he can go without eating, he will only make him hungrier. Furthermore, he says he can't let go of the stripper, since he knows about him, but lets a number of other people go and learn what he is. There are many inconsistencies. <br /> <br /> Because this vampire chooses to live in such a battered house that the light from street lamps and neighboring buildings pours out as if it were day, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you'd think he'd do a better job, or fix the place a little. He is clearly not a rich vampire. <br /> <br /> This is apparently a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although it was directed by Katt Shea, and the other films he directed for Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II) were quite negative.
