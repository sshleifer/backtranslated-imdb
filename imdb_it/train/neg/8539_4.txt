This captivating (which should not be) low-level Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) seems good, but eh? Let me express to you again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'eh?' you would mind a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it prove. I don't know if it's complicated or cryptic, but there is no denying how laconically calm, strange and verbose. <br /> <br /> Related unrelated sequences (like that unpleasant opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in a sparse story involving the photographer Mario (played by a chest smoker John Caffari, his mustache is a dead bell for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What are the odds?) who leaves his girlfriend at home and meets a young lady (a pathetically patty Shepard) who asks to come with him on a photographic assignment, where in this remote mountain refuge come across some hooded witches. <br /> <br /> Look beyond the intricate structure of the plot and bask in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs some extraordinarily unusual images and gruesome passages, but for the most part it seems sporadically non-existent and blurry, just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's surprising cinematography offers a setting rich in grace as we observe the panoramic views and let time slip away calmly. However there are some areas where it was too dark to see what was happening. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's obsessively extravagant score blends terrifyingly with the densely compulsive atmosphere created. Leads are capable, but there is also a strong group (picking is VÃ­ctor Israel) of secondary performances. <br /> <br /> Slow with little in terms of interest, but this dream set up (which seems to go back and forth) manages to make you look up to its closure.
