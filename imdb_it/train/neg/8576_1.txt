Solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, generates a fast pace that carries on the proceedings in an exciting time through a maze of humorous complications and chillers. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a strong configuration of sinister wickedness. The script contains all the normal mystery film panels, sliding panels, secret passages, thunder and lightning and poisoned darts. Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre go for heavy and obvious melodramatic leons of the gas-lit era. Kay Kyser and his band provided great entertainment for the people who lived in the 1940s and who were trying to forget the horror of World War II.
