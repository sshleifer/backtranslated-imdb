When I think of the revelation that the main character of "Bubble" comes to the end of the film, "Machinist" with Christian Bale comes to mind last year. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> A sober but completely realistic portrait of the life of a small city. The title is a reason for contemplation. Perhaps, we, the audience are those in the "Bubble" since we are not given any profit in the films in 90 minutes duration. The reactions of the public were often complacent and judging, clearly indicating how detached people can be from seeing any thread of humanity in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are the ones people refer to as those who put George W. in office for a second term. <br /> <br /> It makes one reflect on how television reality has ruined our sense of reality when watching an audience jump at their feet for the exit as soon as the role of credits. This film has its merits and deserves consideration for the things it does not say openly.
