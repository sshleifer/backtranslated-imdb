This film started very promising with the story of a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is destined to help him. However, somewhere in the middle it seemed that the writers didn't know where to go from there. <br /> <br /> An incredible event followed the other (Russia must be very small because everyone clashes with each other all the time), the motivation of the female protagonist is understandable (because she still follows him after to get off the ship?) Why not try to borrow a cell phone on the ship to call someone?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend had to be fun? the younger sister?). Despite all this apparent arbitrariness of the plot, the film managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The saddest thing is that there was great potential. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the images and the soundtrack were very beautiful and even the actors of the main characters were good. So this may have been a good movie ... but it wasn't.
