Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) is out with his local Jindabyne, Australia's fishing companions for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers the body of an aboriginal woman floating face down in a river, it seems that things have gone for the worst. The biggest victim of the weekend is the common sense of men. They do not come out of the ravine and instead end the fishing weekend with some large outlets. Then they go out and bring the body back. <br /> <br /> The city and the lives of men quickly turn into a mess. Local media swarm them and accusations of Aboriginal prejudice rise from the local natives. Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney, THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE), perceives the deeper meanings of what her husband and friends have done, but must fight with it through her own mental illness. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos is the life that was this young woman who is now a media show, lying on a slab of the morgue. His murder and the subsequent discharge into the water are the symbol of what lies beneath the city of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and marginalized. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand some of what are happening are two little boys: Stewart's and Claire's son, who is led by an Australian half-breed whose mother was killed just a few years earlier . The girl lives with her grandparents and is trying to let her mother go in the best way possible, and the discovery of a new body looks like ?? strange enough ?? a method in which to obtain this (once again the underlying current of Jindabyne is hypothesized). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne township feels what lies beneath its surface, but none of them is willing to dive into the murky waters and take a look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake that is used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old city of Jindabyne beneath its surface). No one, that is, until Claire forces them to. <br /> <br /> The film is interesting if a little too twisted. There are too many plots that had to be explored and simply not made; too many loose threads. The acting was ok, but the shooting was terrible. Flickering cameras, grainy or dark shots, and only a general shortage wound the overall production. <br /> <br /> I like symbolic films, NORTHFORK is one of my all-time favorites in this regard. But Jindabyne needed to raise her head above the murky water so that she could see her problems, which simply didn't happen.
