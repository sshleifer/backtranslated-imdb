turned out to be another failed attempt by the ridiculous science fiction channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and played the poem, but I'm sure it was a 17-year-old teenager who thought it would be great to have a crossbow with the purpose in the film. Aaaaaaah! when I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then ... they left for the heorot in one that appears to be the ship Christopher Columbus was traveling on! when they reach Heorot (which should be a Norwegian mead hall), the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make the heorot look like a great stone castle. when I saw that part ... I wanted to scream. I really wanted this film to be good, but science fiction has not yet produced a good movie, so I don't know why I put my hopes up. Oh, and Grendel and her mother are stupid too. (this comment is off topic on "Grendel") If someone from the science fiction channel is reading this ... there is good advice. NOT EVERY FILM YOU MAKE TO BE ON A GREAT MONSTER THAT CAN STORE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE, NOT WHAT SCIENCE IS CUSTOMIZED! AND ALSO STOP THE LOW-LEVEL ACTORS LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN TO BE IN YOUR FILM! HAS NOT HELPED THE FILM, BUT MAKING IT SO !!!
