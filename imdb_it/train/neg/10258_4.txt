The Earth is destined to no longer be thanks to Father Pergado and a group of nuns. Christopher Lee (who since then has said he was deceived to appear in this by his producers who told him a lot of great actors involved) is Padre Pergado and does his usual serious and scary routine. The cast is not bad, although many have withdrawn from acting. The film has terrible sound effects (mainly created by the keys pressed on an old computer apparently) and, sometimes, ridiculously pondering, showing a scene from the sky, for example, for what appears to be a schedule at a time. Despite this, the story is rather amusing in a world where destiny is determined and production is adequate. It is interesting to note that one scene features Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Meda Band; The writer Frank Ray Perilli and Charles Band's assistant Bennah Burton. Despite his lackluster nature, I genuinely wanted to see how everything worked, so I liked it a lot.
