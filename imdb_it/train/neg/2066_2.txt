After two long and long opening skits, one of which my brother saw the conclusion coming and the other totally joked, we start the fast forward party which is GROOVE TUBE. Of course, the uber-stupid brotherhood boys who continue to run JACKASS or Tom Green will find the idea of ​​fecal matter coming out of a tube, SEX OLYMPICS (I don't really need to give you the details, I do), and a clown who basically the "not very appealing clown" bit i think i saw about ninety times now i will eat it like dung beetles: well, more power for you. <br /> <br /> I just want to express this, despite what you've heard, this film has never been a model for the many infinitely more fun films like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE or what not. The screenplay film had already been made AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX, and so on. And done better.
