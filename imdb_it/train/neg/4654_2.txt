A vampire woman kills young women and paints with their blood. He has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire, so he has to do what he orders or be turned into a blood sucker. After some killings, the assistant has a remorse and falls in love with a homeless girl. <br /> <br /> What can I say about this movie? That its rhythm is too slow, that it has some strange sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and the atmosphere (new jazz here I come) and that the lights do not seem to be included on the set. It looks like a horror film "auteur" with all the self-sufficiency inside it. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely stupid and, as you can guess, it's the vampire who explains how to kill it even if it doesn't. I have to do it; of course, crosses, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> It is not even a funny and disgusting movie. Maybe with some friends and lots of beers, he can't have his funny sides (to be honest, it's fun for 10 to 15 minutes towards the end of the movie). Don't be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's one of the bad films they present.
