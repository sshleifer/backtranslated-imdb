The main fault of this film is that it is impossible to believe that one of these people would ever be chosen for a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing David Lansbury's sweet voice struggling with the famous "Tomorrow, Tomorrow and Tomorrow" speech made it impossible to believe that anyone would ever consider him for the role. I kept believing that he had not gotten the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a larger name was available. Then, when we see some parts of the game during rehearsals, it is hard to believe that the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly wrong and distorted mixture of actors who are unable to articulate or understand the verses and directors who see the game through their crazy interpretations. Sometimes directors are so eager to make their films (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own work) that they are less satisfied. This seems to be an example.
