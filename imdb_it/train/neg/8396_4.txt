... but I saw even better. <br /> <br /> The story here is predictable - a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders have occurred. Three guess what happens. This is not a total bomb: the cast is quite good with the professionals John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine who give the best performances. It's reasonably well done - for a low budget movie. Don't expect nudity, profanity, blood or cold blood (the film has a very mild PG rating). I've never been bored at all: it's ok to see on a quiet night. I saw it on video - it was a HORRIBLE print - very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. I still haven't hated it and it has an interesting ending that surprised me - after all nothing happens until then, so it takes you by surprise. Worth seeing, but only if you are a complete horror film.
