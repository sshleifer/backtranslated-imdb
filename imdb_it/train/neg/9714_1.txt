I hate this program: not only is the concept ridiculous, but it tries to be so feasible (something that has been left out of similar "I confess" programs like, Muder: She Wrote). <br /> <br /> Sigh. Why can't writers ever be smart enough in this program to find evidence that they can stay and win a court decision? <br /> <br /> Let's go: after X-number of years of unsolved cases, why EVERY SUSPECTED, EVERY EPISODE * CONFESS * (damn!) to a murder that would otherwise remain unresolved? <br /> <br /> I bet all the cops will want the criminals to be these good sportsmen: "Aw, shucks, officer, you're a brilliant guy - I guess if you found out enough to convince yourself that I did it, I might as well admit it and make it easier in court. What can I say, "nice cop". <br /> <br /> Absolute dog and an insult to those of us with enough brains to have even heard of IQ
