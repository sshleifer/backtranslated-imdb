Thanks to a notorious home video distributor that brought the so-called independent German series, Four For Venice is not only horrible, but really horrible. So terrible, that I dumped it in the second-hand goods store for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement to have sex only on Tuesday because of their hectic schedule. Eva and Luis are a couple of couples who live hand in mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly induces Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had a relationship with Eva and Nick. Luis betrayed Eva by telling her that he would fly to London to do something related to his works of art, but the fact is that he is flying to Venice with Charlotte for an adulterous vacation. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged his 2 children to Venice for a fight. The journey to Venice ends with the fall of Nick and Eva. <br /> <br /> The presentation of the trip from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. Not only does it seem senseless, but it is also neglected. In the movie, Nick tries to find help in several ways, but it ends up unnecessarily. They are strangers around him who act like idiots, or are just stupid. <br /> <br /> The comedy also tended to add useless scenes to lengthen the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, nobody in the movie uses common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It fails so badly that even the beautiful sceneries of Venice fail to bring up the reputation of the film.
