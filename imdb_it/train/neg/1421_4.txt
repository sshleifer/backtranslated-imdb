I rented the English version of Lensman in a dubbed version, hoping that since it came from famous novels it would have a certain substance. While there were traces of substance in the film, it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoons. Perhaps the film was a bad adaptation of the book, or lost a lot in the dubbed version. Or perhaps even the novels of origin were light. But for some reason, there wasn't much there. <br /> <br /> I have noticed many details that were derived, sloppy, not dramatic, or in any case lacking. Some examples: the opening scenes were borrowed from the 2001 "star gate" scene and from the image of the Star Wars hyperspace. The robot on the reaper looked like an anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> Begin by trying to borrow his Star Wars comic style, but fortunately (since humor doesn't work) he gives up on comedy and sounds serious. In this sense, he is superior to the Star Wars franchise, which began with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated with Jar-Jar's annoying nonsense. <br /> <br /> The details of agriculture were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. The reaper was driving through the untrimmed medium of a field, unloading silage on non-harvested crops instead of work from one side to the other and download the silage on already collected files or on a truck. Mais (corn) was pouring the wheat chute, but the farm lands were designed like a cornfield. <br /> <br /> When it was time for Kim's father to face his fate, there was no dramatic weight on the scene. This could be partly the fault of the English dubber, but the drawings did not show much weight. Even Kim's reactions in that scene were not convincing. <br /> <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris showed very little reaction, although apparently they were supposed to be close. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, his name is not revealed until his death scene.) He seems to forget it promptly. Someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. I think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there is at least a hint of feeling in Chris's drawings. <br /> <br /> On several occasions, the villains fail to complete their orders. A bad boss often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. I can't tell if it was removed from Star Wars, or if it comes from a previous source - perhaps Lensman's books. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which a spaceship crashes. As it dives to the ground, the parts come off the ship. But so many pieces fall out that there should be nothing left when it lands. <br /> <br /> While in most cases Chris seems a competent and tough space hero, there is a scene where she screams like an incompetent damsel in distress. Someone hard enough to overcome Henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to scream, "Help, he caught me and I can't reach my gun!" instead of screaming. <br /> <br /> The character with more personality (almost too often) is D.J. Bill. It looked like Wolfman Jack, the D.J. in American Graffiti. I wonder if it is so well expressed in the original language. <br /> <br /> Two planets in the film exploded. The explosions were insignificant and seemed to be inspired by Star Wars. To his credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely different from the primary Death Star weapon. The dialogue had a good interesting explanation for the cause. Many other explosions in the film looked good, not just planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects are very approximate, as if they were borrowed from a video game from the 70s. Some images look like primitive video games and even Tron's influence is visible. On the other hand, the sound effects are often quite decent, although this underlines the poor sounding parts. Even the art is good, especially when it moves away from the computerized graphics that are often flashy. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the story. If a film tells a good story, it can make it through many gaps in production. But the plot here was pretty light. A naive boy tries to help someone on a paralyzed spaceship and gains a great power he doesn't understand. He and his band of very virtuous comrades fight against a powerful, hopelessly wicked enemy. He makes friends, learns his special power and becomes a young man. If he is persevering and virtuous enough, he could even defeat the evil enemy. The details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline, but there is much more to this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's just a cartoon for children. But then, since it seems that the main target audience is that of older children, perhaps it doesn't need to be anything else.
