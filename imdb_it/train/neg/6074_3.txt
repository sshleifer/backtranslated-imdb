What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes are associated with something similar. If you're going to make a film that involves baseball and shows baseball scenes, at least make the action look a little realistic. Why has the public always been standing without any particular reason during the games? *** POSSIBLE SPOILER *** And the last scene of the movie .... what was it? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way into the field in referee's uniform, and that the game is also played in a torrential downpour ... one of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 3 stars out of 10.
