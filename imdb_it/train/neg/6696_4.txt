(There are spoilers) The murderous nympho prostitute Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over the life and the car of the 18 virgin, even if he is too embarrassed to admit it, the collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the film Myia not only drifts, but gives the poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to identify a dangerous stone work and keep it as far as possible for him or her, in order to avoid becoming one. <br /> <br /> Around a stop for trucker Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for a warm and heavy action, in the back seat of his stroller. Roy is too drunk or stupid to realize that Miya is nothing but his estranged daughter! Outraged by the fact that Miya is reluctant to accept him, Roy strangles her almost to death only to be interrupted by the first-year collage student, Trent Colbert, who furrows the side of the rest area by sliding one of the truckers. <br /> <br /> Seeing his chance, Miya jumps in Trent's car and the two are out in what appears to be the strangest car hunt ever put into a movie. Going all over the northeastern United States the two end up involved in a truck car that destroys a murder and a shootout with state soldiers who then takes Trent's parents home with them hostage. That's where there is another wild shootout between the mad Miya with an entire SWAT team reinforced by local police and state soldiers. <br /> <br /> You would expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentionally or less intentionally funny, but it is not. In fact, the film is very disturbing in the way Miya treats everyone in the film that comes into contact with his perverted and abusive father. Getting Trent to drive her around the northeast of Miya makes the poor drunk get drunk with him in a motel room, along with whips, handcuffs and a lit candle. Miya also gets the motel owner with the cuckold Mr. Foster engaging him in giving her his gun, as part of some strange sex game. After holding Foster in his arms, he leaves with Trent's, who came out of his hotel room, with a wallet of $ 400.00, but doesn't bother going by car with his car. <br /> <br /> Needing money to pay for gas to go home to his parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call from his cell phone from Miya to pick her up at a local restaurant to get his money back. Like the jerk that is Trent he picks up Miya, who is now a fugitive from the law, and later gets involved with his father Roy on the public road while trying to get Trent and Miya out of the street. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this abandoned clothing house that Roy chases after Miya, running on a muddy street with stilettos, letting him enter the sai where his own gun blew. Roy was so busy taking off his pants that he had forgotten he had left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> Both with a robbery and with a murder, in addition to a hard blow, the two desperados charge against them in an S & M / Tattoo boutique where Trent makes ears and piercings and disguises themselves skin and chains, by Myri, combined with a collar for his and her dogs. This in order to meet his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving dinner. <br /> <br /> After a shootout with state soldiers, with one of them seriously injured, the two fugitives of the law end up with Trent's parents, Messrs. Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn, at home with all the local police, with a SWAT team, are waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> Hateful movie with a really scary final ending that made you wonder what exactly the movie was trying, if at all, to tell its audience. At first, you felt a lot of sympathy for Miya, but as the film slipped along its unexpected ending that quickly faded like a tray of ice babies in Death Valley. Although Roy was the most unlikely person in the film, at the beginning of the film, when Miya totally eclipsed him.
