I have to say I hated this movie. I don't like to say it because Gerard Butler is there. About half an hour of boring conversation, sorry for all those really interested in the storyline, I started forwarding to Gerry's scenes. I don't really know the ending, I was so bored. If Gerry wasn't there, I probably did one of two things: fall asleep or turn it off, but Gerry is the bright light of this movie, as it is in most of his previous films. If you are a fan of Gerry's don't worry, it's adorable and precious as always, but if you really want to watch the film for the plot, good luck because you'll need it, or that or a lot of coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... and it's only because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea how to spell his name!
