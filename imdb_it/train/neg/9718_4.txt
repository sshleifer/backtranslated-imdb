An innocent man (Steve Guttenberg) has a one-night stand with his boss's wife (Isabelle Huppert). He sees a woman (Elizabeth McGovern) being attacked outside, but cannot call the police because it would cause her to marry Gutenberg's boss (Paul Shenar). So Guttenberg, who is an honest citizen when he finds out that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later, comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack, with the intention of simply transmitting the information that had been provided by Huppert. Well - never say false testimony against your neighbor, as they say. <br /> <br /> This simple attempt to help the police capture a murderer quickly turns into contortions. When he meets the first nearby victim, McGovern, he immediately makes twigs for what happened, but he agrees to keep quiet for the moment. But then Guttenberg finds himself in court, assuming he identifies the heavy (Greenquist) and we discover through cross-examination that he is CLOSE to MIND and cannot identify objects at a distance, not to mention the faces. (Not that it's important because, after all, he never saw the creeping in the first place.) The plot becomes practically labyrinthine. Guttenberg ends up with the main suspicion when Huppert is also murdered. <br /> <br /> Barely escapes arrest and sucks with the now likeable McGovern. Guttenberg and McGovern hatch a plan to trap the killer. She will serve as bait. They will follow the creeping scourge in one of his sad charlatans and McGovern will behave like the doxy to which the killer is attracted, only to make him try to kill her. But everything will be fine, you see, because not only will Guttenberg keep it under control, and not only will he warn the police a few minutes after he has done this dive, but he will keep a can of bat handy - just in case. <br /> <br /> I ask you, the alarm viewer, does this scenario take place as planned? Elizabeth McGovern has an oddly interesting bone structure. Sometimes it looks like a jaw and a small mouth, but it's vibrant. Steve Guttenberg has hair on his muscle and that's it. Otherwise he is as helpless as the character he plays. If Isabelle Huppert can act, it is not evident in this film. The killer is so shaped and so cared for that he looks like he's wearing one of those deformity masks in that Twilight Zone episode about greedy heirs. <br /> <br /> Has the director, Curtis Hanson, not yet done "LA Confidential"? That was a job well done. Here, everything seems clumsy and forced, up to the small parts. Just before the inevitable violent climax, a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay McGovern's rescue, and the scene is embarrassing to watch. Dick Olsen has a part as a late customer. He is a clean and always reliable guy. Paul Shenar, the cuckold husband, has a surprising face that seems made for the stage and also does a great job. <br /> <br /> That yelp where McGovern attracts the attention of the murderer, where he plays billiards with a pair of furry monkeys, was killed in a bar in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, not far from where I lived. The way the interior is set up, it is clear that this should be a dangerous and dirty dip. It actually looks more elegant on the screen than it actually was. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the territory of Hitchcock and brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story.
