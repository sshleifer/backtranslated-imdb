If you want to see a film about two absolutely unpleasant characters, this is it. The acting is superb, both by John Cassavetes and the paranoid fool who, as the saying goes, I REALLY out to get, and from Peter Falk as his best life friend he turns to for rescue. Big mistake, but since they are both amoral gangsters and misogynistic bastards to boot, it's difficult to decide who to root for LESS. Only writer / director Elaine May could have achieved this. I found it interesting that in a long interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD, he revealed that the two stars had "very different ideas" about the script, that the director was almost impossible to work, that the cinematographer had requested made impossible to him, that the crew was constantly angry for being forced to sit in wait, and so on. This mood of a VERY dysfunctional large family clearly manifests itself on the screen.
