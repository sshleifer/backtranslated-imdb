The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of the darker Gojira, less child-oriented (Godzilla) for the sensitivity of the 1960s. Gamera, of course, is a giant flying turtle that literally throws energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most cases. <br /> <br /> This version of the original film was edited and taken by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like in the Americanized version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera the Invincible" is not only wrong in spelling. The American scenes are not as ridiculous and annoying as those added to the great Gojira, but in reality they don't add much to the plot because there is little following on them. <br /> <br /> The film starts promising, there are some scenes worthy of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside the main plot. Once Gamera appears, however, the film begins to descend into a kaiju movie rather than run of the mill. <br /> <br /> The acting is pretty good - even the American add-ons are OK. The direction is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all the miniatures). Some sets and backgrounds are actually very good. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem here, of course, is that there is nothing original about this movie. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later films, many of which deserve to be seen if you are a fan of Kaiju.
