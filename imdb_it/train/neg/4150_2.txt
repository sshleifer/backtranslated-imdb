Oh, it really is. I've seen films that I don't like the most because of any reason, but I've never seen a film that fails in every single aspect of making a film. He can't even fail in film making, in a way that New York's Hercules could be said to do. It's not the film I like least, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that strikes you. I've never seen a movie played worse than pornography. In fact, I have a lot of pornographic films that have done better than that. It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's terrible. Camera work is amateur. The assembly is meaningless I assume they could not afford adequate audio equipment, and this meant that every scene in a car (and there are many) makes them drive about three miles an hour and every scene set outside of it Woodland area (and there are also many) is actually nicknamed by a studio, again lending more to the bad atmosphere of porn. <br /> <br /> The plot is meaningless, as many have pointed out. I will defend the vampires who walk in the light of day from the fact that although it was made popular by Nosferatu, this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire myth. About the vampire myths, the writer had evidently read Carmilla or at least seen The Vampire Lovers. I'm not sure what I feel about this, swinging from the fact that such a terrible film has at least some aspirations for a gothic novel that I'm very fond of; or bothered by his best references to the bat and in the worst total desecration of the source material. At least "the General" is an insult to Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> However he gets two stars, simply because I can't take myself to vote for a star for a movie he has, or at least pretends to have, both vampires and zombies in it. Incidentally, I saw Lifeforce (another film that has tenuously in vampires and zombies) on the same day, and although it is a rather imperfect film in itself, it really comes out a masterpiece compared to this. <br /> <br /> I know in the end, this is not such a bad film, it's okay, or so bad it is anyway nice, even drunk. It's just a disaster, and it's not worth looking at.
