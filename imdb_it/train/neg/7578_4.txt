Suggesting no less than a film version of the 1970s television hit "Love, American Style", decorated with nudity, "Superchick" (1973) is a light piece of soft toy that somehow still manages to entertain. And the main character here, Tara B. Vero, is really kind of a superchick. A stewardess (not a flight attendant) who is so beautiful that even her plane's autopilot has taken a ride to her (!), And with a big guy in every port, this wingin ', swingin' gal really puts the " lay "in" stop ". What with his germaphobe surgeon in New York, his playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and his creative rock star dude defying L.A., Tara definitely keeps himself busy. And when he does not drain these boys of all their virile energies, as the spectator learns, he is subject to taking a karate lesson, doing discos from a mile to another, fending off lightning and rapists, attending big parties and stopping an attempt hijacking on his plane. Like I said, carefree fun, and definitely good for a night when you feel a little dead in the brain and you just want to get out in front of the tube. Future astrologer Joyce Jillson brings a little bit of fascination to her role as Tara, and the film looks pretty good to satisfy. Disappointing, the 70s prefer Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are wasted here in very small roles, but still manage to do what they do best - show off their combs! Although the image is never fun and doesn't have many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it manages to be constantly funny, and I suppose it's something. Strange that the credits should draw attention to the double body of Mrs Jillson, however; don't think you've ever seen it before!
