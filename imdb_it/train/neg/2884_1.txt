While working in a video store, I found my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen and to warn my friends and work colleagues. On a day of particularly heated debate about which is the worst film, my friend challenged me to watch B.T.K. Assassin, also stating that if I could watch the whole movie and say that my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he would watch it. I lost. I think even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great achievements of a young genius. This film was not only lacking in what appeared to be a production value (it seems that it was shot on a bad camera, even if it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (in wood, empty and pathetic, it doesn't scratch the surface), so like the feeling of a bad movie. I can remember a scene in which I heard the smash, suddenly I remembered some bad high school comedy (I know that I attend high school too often here, but this film seemed very youthful) both in terms of sets, which seemed too fake, but also as if people read their lines from the script, not quite sure what was really going on. My review does not do justice to this film, because I cannot describe how terrible the time spent watching this was. It is almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a film.
