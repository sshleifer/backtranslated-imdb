This is a film about making a film. Such films can be fun, but they need a certain substance to do it. It didn't happen here, I'm afraid. Mr Coppola did not inherit his father's abilities, unfortunately (not even his sister, who can still make films that could be seen). I wonder how this film came to get such enthusiastic reviews. <br /> <br /> Let's see: the leading actor, presumably a director, is as expressive as a frozen squid and his voice has the same tone as what he says, the leading actress has an expression on her face that never changes, the plot is totally segmented in bits with perhaps a single connection element, the film within the idea of ​​the film must be more stale than the Paleolithic rocks ... Would that be enough? <br /> <br /> I regret every single moment I saw this movie. A walk with the dog is an entertainment far superior to this incredibly lame film. Is it as if a plot by François Truffaut was directed by Dick Cheney ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, other classic science fiction films? You really have to joke ...
