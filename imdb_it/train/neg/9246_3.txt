I refused to see this when it was originally broadcast, capitalizing on the late 1960s series with Mike Pratt and Kenneth Cope, but I can never resist a challenge. I should have known him better. Not really a remake, and more of a parody than a tribute, this show did not know how to interpret it, and plumped with childish comedies and cartoons and characters. The three main characters were little more than the caricatures of the actors, and only Emilia Fox could act (Bob Mortimer is painful in a direct role). Supporting casts were simply comedians, acquaintances of Vic and Bob who wanted to be part of the joke, and all too aware of the situation to be convincing. And the CGI, even if the effects could not be of help to those available 30 years before, did nothing but dazzle the viewer with the lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and the dialogue . All style and no substance. (And while the show of the '60s is teased to be much of its time, this "update" is also very dated, with "Matrix" fashions, mandatory scenes of "feminine power" and less than subtle tension between the two living leads.)
