I had heard (and read) so many positive things about Weeds that I couldn't wait to make friends with another great series of cables (like Entourage, Sopranos or Mad Men), but that slowly faded with every episode I watched from the first season. (failed to pass the first six episodes) <br /> <br /> The writing was unoriginal, inventive and the portrait of blacks embarrassing. The dialogue seemed forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to be smart and fashionable. It was a rare moment when I actually heard a loud laugh. <br /> <br /> The characters never developed enough to worry me about them, they were selfish and unattractive. I absolutely hated the addition of his brother-in-law (who should have been dragged to To Catch A Predator) and the removal of Hodes Quinn's daughter from the cast by sending her to boarding school in Mexico was so unoriginal and clich√©, I had to conclude that the writers were testing the loyalty of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Episode by episode I less liked the characters and could not overcome many of the technical flaws in the plot. <br /> <Apart from that, I felt that the second season was not good, so I lost all motivation to keep seeing this presentation. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of good casting and writing, I suspect this show will be a challenge that you will like, unless, of course, you are stoned and all bets are over.
