This film has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and artistic characterization, the acting and directing we saw with The Sopranos, but I just saw the honor of Prizzi for the first time, on DVD, alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of watching with an audience of 24 years ago must have been quite different, but I must say that I was horrified at the end. Not just the violence of it, but the simple idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> I like a good shocker, but this seemed so out of character ... Besides, when was this move supposed to be set? The machines all seemed to date back to the 1960s, yet the towers of the World Trade Center {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many scenes of the urban landscape. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film is badly aged is the simple idea that a passenger could travel from coast to coast with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the mid-80s audience found this film fascinating and fun. In the mid-eighties, we meet the last intentions: only you can live.
