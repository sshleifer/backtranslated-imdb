It's interesting at the beginning. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a cute and mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) whom she has only known for a short time. They look happy, then disappear without warning. He looks for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of his last years of abused and squalid recent past, which may include criminal activities. And then, it seems that the directors didn't know what to do with the story. The beginning, though not as suspicious as it seems, is at least watchable. So it ceases to be interesting or even very sensible. And the ending is so lame, so boring, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the writers didn't know what to do with it and get bored trying. What a waste of a good idea!
