I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I thought it was all wrong. Many of the facts were wrong. The only right thing about Chinese history in the film was when Wendy's mother explained to her husband the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very rough and fake. Many actors and actresses were not very good. Some of the jokes that were apparently "funny" were really stupid. I think this film should get the worst rating it could get. Disney has really had more information on Chinese history if they want to create a whimsical film. Mulan was quite precise. Watch this movie if you want to waste time.
