Nothing positive to say. Meaningless nonsense, puffing and puffing with a "message". New Russian films (post-Soviet) can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), yet many have the cardboard bouquet and the asbestos aftertaste (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a kind of "dozor" void. To act would be horrible if it were not for the saving grace of an absolutely unattractive direction and an incompetent montage that is sometimes so terrible that distracts from the actors' powerlessness. Special award to the cameraman to make sure every shot is shaky (should anyone please understand that Blair Witch has had his 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) And the jacks are geared towards children who are careless and subdued on CounterStrike and masturbation . The female protagonist poses and tries to look too seductive, the male anti-hero needs an instructor of diction (even if the genetics is not bad: rather expressive eyes.) A (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively is a (distant) cousin of the "authors".
