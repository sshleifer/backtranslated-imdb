I'm a big Nicolas Cage fan and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and thought it wouldn't hurt to watch it at least once ... but believe me, it is. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the old movie. .but why they should want to do a movie like this again. The basic idea of ​​a good horror movie is that it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film does not fit into any of these and simply remains stupid. I kept watching the movie hoping it would become interesting at some point, but it never is. <br /> <br /> So this movie is a big no for both horror and Cage fans. You could probably see it on television.
