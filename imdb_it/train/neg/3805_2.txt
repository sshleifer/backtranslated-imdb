Err ... this movie sucked. VERY. <br /> <br /> I have read some of the other reviews. Apparently there are a lot of people who think that whatever Woody Allen writes or interprets is automatically good ... <br /> <br /> I've seen many of his films, in the vain hope that I miss something. But no, they just suck. Badly written basket. The characters are all very stereotyped (not to say rather stupid). The plot is ... I think it should be mysterious. I'm not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, in every other movie you've seen of his own. <br /> <br /> If you are a Woody Allen fan, go see this movie. If you are under 50, don't worry. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen And you're under 50 ... well, you're atypical. I don't know what to say.)
