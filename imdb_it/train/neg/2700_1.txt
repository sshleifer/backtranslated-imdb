Despite, or perhaps partly due to the clever use of music to underline the motivations and ideologies of each of the main characters, stereotypes are present, and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not too thin cinematic background. <br /> <br /> One has the feeling that John Singleton took delight in post-structural literary theory because it was the taste of the day and "Higher Learning" was the slanting result. The lowest point of the film is the "peace" rally, in which the symbols of the "free love" movement of the '60s are taken for what resembles more closely a "Take Back The Night" rally with live musical acts , stridently identity-conscious in tow. Perhaps in his primitive revisionism the director was trying to say that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich of him ?? and Remy is shooting in the crowd is a nice touch, if you like Rich's political posture. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie some negative stars. I can only recommend it to those interested in the 1990s as a story, a period in which radical feminists brought the academic triad of race, class and gender to popular culture and declared human hatred "a viable POLITICAL option and honorable ". Where is Camille Paglia when you need her?
