I watched this movie exclusively for the setting. It was shot in an old hotel owned by a friend. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediocre at best, the fears were all coarse, not real fears. <br /> <br /> I don't remember much of the plot, and I think it's because there wasn't much of one to remember. They haven't even used the hotel for its fullest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost a mile in the bay, which is actually a disturbing sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is with the remote control in hand so you can quickly advance through the action scenes (and I'm using that term freely) and stop at the beauty of the surroundings!
