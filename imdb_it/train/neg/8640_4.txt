I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why he got such horrible reviews here. It was easy enough to watch (at 3am). He had a good casting - the role of Kevin Dillon of the sociopathic serial killer was very credible - he was both charismatic and chilling. The rest of the main characters were not so bad. <br /> <br /> This is the typical stalker / suspense movie. A married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic to ask for help. A sociopathic donor of "genetic material" fixes the recipients and, in the typical stalker form, interferes in their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film was pretty good ... we see "Conan" growing more and more obsessed with raising his child and creating the perfect family with his mother. Obviously things don't work out for him as planned. Not a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant of movies (especially at 3am!), But I was simply surprised how badly the ending was written. Actually I scoffed! <br /> <br /> All in all, not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I wouldn't be able to do it again (unless I skip the ending). The only resounding quality here was the role of Kevin Dillon - - one of the best serial killers ever. <br /> <br /> Try looking at the other channels before watching this .. But, if there's nothing better, I'd like to try it .. =)
