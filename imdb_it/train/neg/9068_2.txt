Named for the Oscar "worst ever screenplay" in my opinion. There is no decent story, ridiculous acting, VERY lousy humor. With every means possible, if you have little respect for yourself, don't waste time watching this movie. Although you can see the actors CAN act, it leaves you more stupid after seeing it. Precious brains are killed watching this shit ... <br /> <br /> I warned you <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS FILM
