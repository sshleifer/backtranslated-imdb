Every generation believes fully to live in recent times. This has been true for thousands of years. And movies like this feed on this. How did the great Orson Welles tell this train disaster? This is a documentary on the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. Try to connect prophecies to the best of what was happening in the times in which it was created, making it obviously antiquated and dated. <br /> <br /> The re-enactments seem to come from "Unsolved mysteries" "but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to take part in this. <br /> <br /> In short, the film is dated, silly, reactionary and useless.Good if you want a good laugh, but not enough to actually search.
