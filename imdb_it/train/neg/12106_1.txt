A cowardly and cowardly film. Director Boorman shows Cahill to rob rich houses, but the male occupant is shown unfaithful with the nanny, all right. The forensic scientist who is investigating Cahill has blown himself up in his car, but he is a mouse who has problems with sourpuss, and he doesn't look like a good man, so that's okay too. The Beits, owner of Russborrough House, made their money by exploiting the "darkies" that dug diamonds, so it is right to steal their priceless art and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains. The Garda kills his ferrets and they are implicated in his murder. The moral equivalence is nauseating, Boorman looks for a successful film, but does not have the courage to oppose the crime of the gang of generals, which has terrorized the neighborhood, and has unleashed another wave of junk on Dublin. He also made friends with the generals' son as he did so. Disgusting. Shame on your cowardice.
