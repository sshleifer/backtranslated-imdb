The only scary thing about this film is the thought that anyone who made it could do a following. <br /> <br /> From start to finish "The Tooth Fairy" was really terrible. It looked like a misinterpreted children's movie that mingled with a witch of the "Wizard of Oz" who melted and a happy ending of babies combined with some damaging effects and curses. <br /> <br /> Half the cast seems completely useless except for being comfortably there to be murdered in some way. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have absolutely no sense in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories, but apparently they couldn't be disturbed. The people watching the movie know that the characters are there for some bloody death scene, but come on, at least TRY them and you have a slight plot for them. The story in general is weak with irregular behavior of the characters that makes you want them all to be eaten by the witch. <br /> <br /> Add the weak storyline and weak acting together (the children are particularly wooden) and the film ends in complete failure. If only MST3K could have tried this ...
