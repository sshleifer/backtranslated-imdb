Wow. The only people who positively review it are the Carpenter apologists. I know many of those. The boys who will see John Carpenter crouch on a celluloid and pull out a movie and proclaim it a masterpiece of horror. This "movie" is shit. It looks and sounds like a porn (good sir, the soundtrack is horrible ...), and has sub-par pornographic acting, which is shocking, because normally Ron Perlman is a really good actor. I honestly have no idea what Carpenter was thinking when he did it. Most likely "Beans, beans, beans .." until someone fed him and rolled him up in a blanket for the day ... They don't say anything about the abortion debate, when they could have had a very interesting central theme how do anti-abortion religious zealots feel when it's the devil's child? hysterically bad. Not a single person from this episode or what should come out unscathed. It's just awful. Come, Plan 9 From awful Outerspace. For example, dear god, please someone should turn it off before I get terribly dirty. Try watching this and The Thing on the same day and your mind will implode.
