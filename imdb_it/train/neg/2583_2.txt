Another American Pie movie was pushed down the throat and this is the worst of all. It does not deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at "The Wedding". <br /> <br /> This movie looks like just a stupid porn movie that they slapped the American Pie title on. When I was looking at this it felt like I was watching a different series. It's not like American Pie at all. He has a different humor and is much more rude and has more sex scenes than the other American Pie movies. <br /> <br /> I never recommend it. I actually don't recommend any of the "American Pie Presents" movies. Just stick to the beautiful original trilogy. <br /> <br /> 2/10
