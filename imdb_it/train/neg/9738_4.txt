Not so bad, how is it credited to be (Hooper is done much worse) ?? more disappointing for me. A concept so imaginative, which has never been exploited by Hooper with its economic direction and even less in smoky writing (excuse the pun). It becomes so sinister and exaggerated in a serious and grave tone, becoming ridiculous and blurred, letting all the pessimistic mystery / conspiracy conspiracy narrative be easily telegraphed to end up on something completely abrupt. Because of this, the rhythm becomes rather slow and Brad Dourif (nice to see him in a starring role) seems to struggle with an unbalanced performance, despite having an oddly bizarre intensity to his off-color character. Even if it is cheap, there is a competent technical attitude. However, he does not seem to go out of the ordinary with his idea and wants to plaster in ugly shots (which some work) and extraordinarily steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper shows some elegantly frantic images (later on towards the end), and camera work is quickly maneuvered and the radiant score is titillating. Performances are everywhere with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but funny cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprising, but it is passively engaging.
