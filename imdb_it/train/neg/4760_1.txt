This reworking of Anthony Shaffer's classic drama did not last long in theaters. Having recently suffered through the cable, I congratulate myself again for not wasting money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter and producer / screenwriter Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain this parody through an interminable 93 minutes, without the fun or class of the longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine strengthened his reputation by playing the second role in the wonderful 1972 film. Now he seems intent on destroying it by trying the command, played in that version by Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for the best Oscar actors, but lost Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER.) Looking swollen and washed out, Caine slips through the part with less depth than what he shows as Batman's butler. He had already lowered himself to appear as a guest in the atrocious remake of GET CARTER. What are the prospects - ALFIE II, or SON OF THE MAN WHO WOULD BE? <br /> <br /> However, no one benefits from this inane adaptation of Pinter, who thinks that frequent curses and an additional sexual angle can make up for the absence of interaction between Shaffer's witty characters. Branagh's direction is based on bluish lighting and a soulless design set that would not hold up in a second-rate disco. Neither shadows nor tight, overcrowded close-ups can help Law overcome his boring character on the screen. The result is a failure both as a direct drama and as a detective story, as if to make you forget the purpose of the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original theatrical production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine's film would do well to consider this feat as a bad dream. The late Mr. Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 screenplay, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must have turned in his grave, wishing he could plan a real murder or two!
