OK. I know that the John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat, so the expectations for this film were pretty low. <br /> <br /> Yet, after listening to this shit there is a fundamental thing that I can I feel like I'm crazy: <br /> <br /> I sat in an 80s movie Rob Lowe that he had no nudity and only hints of sex in them. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible, the characters boring and flat, the portrait of Oxford an absolute insult, and the non-exciting rowing scenes, without incidents and inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Unless you have some weird Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I think, Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no reason to see this.
