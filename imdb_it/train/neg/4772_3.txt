Before watching this film, I could already say that it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with a shack-like place they were in and the negro who wanted someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). The name of MJH in a film would typically distract me (ugh, can we say GROSS?!), But I wanted to try anyway. <br /> <br /> At first, I was a little interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing almost every reaction of the characters (especially the man who played "Sulley"). MJH was also the worst, but I kept watching. <br /> <br /> However, the ending was the biggest joke of all of them! I sat down seriously thinking "THAT was the ending?! It's a comedy?!". I thought this bunch of crap was more fun than the parody of the "Scary Movie" and that's REALLY to say something!
