Seriously. I just finished my first view of Demonicus and the words disappointed me. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I saw the name of Charles Band on a film and my heart was racing. He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. It was a bulwark of hope for the little man. The guy whose films came to the video store instead of the multiplex, but they kept playing harder than most of the fashionable junk we otherwise had to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious Californian trail doubles for "the Alps" and an abandoned railway tunnel should be "an ancient cave". I mean, they didn't even try to dress it up with moss or film it in a way that might suggest it was something other than an old rail tunnel! Ugh! Instead of a creepy demonic gladiator, as the cover suggests, we're treated to a guy wearing the latest Wal-Mart suit for Halloween. There's a rather cold-looking corpse that occasionally comes to life to belch and move your fingers, but it doesn't even learn to stand up to the last five minutes. Why couldn't he be the bad guy? Instead, we have the frat boy Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is related to this tripe. I love movies that are so bad, they're good. Hell, sometimes I enjoy a movie so bad, it's just ugly. This, however, is simply unwatchable. A perfect example of making money, rather than making a quality film.
