It's the same old man, "If I can't get the funds for my project, I'll inject myself" monster movie. There is nothing new here. It is very similar to the film "Fly" by Jeff Goldblum. The man manages to maintain a semblance of sanity, but in the end he succumbs to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty ugly. There are people who act stupidly all the way, putting their lives in danger without apparent reason. The boy continues to return to the forbidden laboratory. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Sure, he's good-looking, but it seems like a lot of problems. It's just a waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus costume appears to have come off the rack during a Star Trek convention.
