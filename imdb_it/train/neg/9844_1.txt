this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of those films that uses all the stupid who can't imagine a clich√©. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was actually pretty good. But otherwise it's sucked. It was more than 10 years ago that I saw it, but it still hurts and will not stop dwelling in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the film really sums up how stupid it is. I don't want to ruin it for you if you want to try your luck watching this movie. But I guarantee you a moment * nghya * at the end, with some in the middle. If you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it could be worth it. Also, if you're forced to hang out with someone you don't like, suggest that you watch this movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after seeing it. This is a fair price to pay, I guess.
