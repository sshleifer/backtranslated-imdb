I just saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2006. The synopsis in the festival guide seemed pretty good, so we decided to check one. I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Besides being poorly written, it was boring. I will not take the actors away because there is not much they could do with this bad script. <br /> <br /> The first bite was a clich√© without being ironic, beyond the utmost seriousness without being funny. The film would have been better if Hunt Hoe had gone with a horror campy feeling. Instead he took himself seriously and this turned out to be a boring movie. I can't recommend this movie. It seemed too long and all in all simply weak.
