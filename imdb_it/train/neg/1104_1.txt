This is one of the most pessimistic films I've ever had to do. <br /> <br /> History is nothing new - but it's a comic book, so who cares, as long as it's nice and fun? <br /> <br /> I have no intention of deepening the characterizations, or I will be here all day (except to say that there are none, the characters change personalities whenever it is convenient for the plot), but to anyone who has written the script and the visual direction should be forbidden to access paper and pencil. Thumb down? I would like to vote to cut his thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Restricting an object / object of scene Reducing the foreground of the character. The character gives a conscious look, that the public will not understand even remotely. Repeat the operation several times, with different objects / objects of scene. "<br /> <br />" Make sure the characters don't pay attention, the huge pieces of rock float around, crash into each other, generally raining destruction everywhere, and that could kill them all at any time - but make them stop and startle with fear when they see a green rock with a harmless, almost pastoral appearance in the distance. "<br /> <br /> The whole thing is a long succession of events, actions and behaviors that they are there just for the writer's convenience, to avoid having to think or make any effort to write the story correctly. <br /> <br /> This is plan 9 of the CG cartoons, except that it doesn't have the moaning factor of Ed Wood to make it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: spend the budget of your comic on Pixar movies.
