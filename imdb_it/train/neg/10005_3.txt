The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" film - the first is "Brother Carl" by Susan Sontag (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it was better, referring to Dickens' "The Old Curiosity Shop": "One should have had a heart of stone so as not to laugh loudly at the death of Little Nell." Pretty much the same thing here. "Interiors" is full of solemn shouters. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking at medium distance: "I don't like who I'm becoming.") Director quotes (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family continues to remind us how brilliant and talented they are, up to strangulation. ("I read your poem the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker." "Oh. It was an old poem, I reworked it.") Far from not caring about these people, however, I have them found pretty funny. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the fun things from Allen's previous films - only that he directed his actors to play straight lines. Having not taken part in the film, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt who copies all his theatrical tics, intonations and neurotic habits, turning it into an embarrassing surrogate (very similar to Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - a dysfunctional family with a quietly overbearing mother - seems to have been raised more or less by Bergman's "Winter Light," the basic family melodrama deceived by a lot of existential anxiety. Everything goes through visual / phonic tricks: the deafening scratches of a pencil on paper, the surf that dominates people walking on the beach. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> The following "serious" films are less embarrassing, but also much less fun. I'll take "Interiors". Woody rarely made a more fun movie.
