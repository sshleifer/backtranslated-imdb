Looking at it again recently, I found it moving to see how they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen, even though the tight budget and the rock actors meant an inevitable failure. With every objective measure this was a disaster, but I found it easy to imagine how good a Lord of the Rings movie would be if someone did it sincerely - and with the money to employ the most talented artists and screenwriters. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, this won't be possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any kind of budget, therefore, this story simply could not be filled up. Fantasy offers so many opportunities to make an interesting film. There were many moments in this film that were potentially more interesting than the way Peter Jackson did it, although of course you always have to use your imagination because of the bad performance. The way they tried to show the world of the spectrum from Frodo's point of view, for example. Or the way Galadriel showed Sam what was happening at home for another. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really enjoyed in this version - the moments of silence. There were times when the dialogue was spoken without background music against a back-drop still in progress. Compare it to the grandiose dive camera of Jackson's films, and the intrusive soundtrack that seemed designed to emphasize how each scene was the most intense and powerful scene we had ever seen. Jackson's films were full of their own importance, this was quieter and much more modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and co hit this with over $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million more in marketing, a massive tax cut from the New Zealand government, and even got huge savings from filming in New Zealand and not in the United States. However, despite marketing statements, the intention to be faithful has never been there. This is well documented. Philippa Boyens said so much in an interview, when she said that she deliberately did not read the books before writing the script. Jackson also stated that they originally intended to make a fantasy film "along the lines of" the lord of the rings, and that what he really wanted was Return of the King, because he had many battles but no character development. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, this film has tried to be more true. Obviously many things were wrong, the acting was horrible and it practically sank everything, and the pace was too fast. Naturally they cut a lot and adapt other scenes, and for this they deserve credit. While Jackson added many action scenes that did not serve plot purposes, Bakshi cut out scenes from books that did nothing to advance the plot. There is actually a strange similarity between the structure of Jackson and Bakshi's films in the beginning - as they both diverge from the original books in the same way - although obviously some of these could be a coincidence. <br /> <br /> This was not a good movie, but the potential was there. Bakshi said in an interview with the Onion AV club that only animation could do justice to the lord of the rings. His version didn't work, but he could have been right.
