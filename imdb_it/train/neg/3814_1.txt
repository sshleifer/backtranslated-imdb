I can see the girls enjoying this show, but defining this show for families is ridiculous. I am amazed how well he was remembered after all these years. It is an extremely unpleasant and stupid show about the widowed father of three who lives with his dead wife's brother and his stupid school friend, and others as the seasons go on. All the plots generally have a really stupid lesson. In the middle of each episode someone is angry with someone else and each episode is based on a funny joke. As for the actors, I don't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully little fun like Dad with mom's responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a joke of a 30-year-old note something that makes cartoon voices and behaves like a child, and it's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character, but he was so rude that it was hard to look at him. The older girl, DJ, on the show was a really bad actress and showed no emotion. The middle girl Stephanie was too trivial as the annoying little sister. The younger girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always know when they turn off. The plot textures for too many narrative lines were so incredibly stupid as to make one shudder. This is a "family" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and even if they are necessary for a show about a family, they have gone too far. This will be remembered as my least favorite sitcom of the 80s and 90s. My assessment: Terrible show. TVG 30 minutes.
