This is a very bad film. I laughed once or twice, and the plot sucks! There is perhaps a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Through the whole short film, I was falling asleep and wondering when it would be over. <br /> <br /> No one acts human, and everyone behaves in a stupid and ridiculous way. Rob Schneider who acts like an animal is not something I would pay to see. It seemed funny, but the bottom line: DON'T WASTE THE PRECIOUS TIME ON A RIDICULOUS AND STUPID FILM. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it would end, even if it's a short film. At first we thought it would improve; but it gets worse. Stupid, to the end. I left the theater, and I would remember that the film was extremely ugly forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer, but this is nothing like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
