This is a low budget parody of the espionage genre. To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) Acting is wildly heavy. The stars have a lot of fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Often the lines are abruptly shocking and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to the elements of the previous plot. (3) The shots are often framed in out-of-balance angles, making fun of gender excesses. (4) Jeff Goldblum with staring eyes offers complex and classically absurd dialogues in a sarcastic way. <br /> <br /> The film has a guiding intelligence, which starts deliberately from an element of the plot stolen from the B-movies of the 1930s: a secret code with a structure that would challenge Carl Sagan's explanation. The exaggerated recitation of the film is mainly used for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early joke, Fay Grim's son, Ned, is so often told to leave that you can't help but giggle while feeling sorry for the boy. Even the fall from Parker's Posey nicely choreographed bed contributes to a humorous tone at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The slow pace of the film does not exalt the elements of comedy or the dramatic elements that will emerge later. The impact of the film as a drama is significantly diminished by the first comedy. Furthermore, it is difficult to be excessively involved with the characters and their destiny when the first parts of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy, and I found this (and the corners of the camera out of focus) more irritating than humorous. <br /> <br /> Exaggerated acting, the plausible and almost incomprehensible plot of conspiracies / counter conspiracies, and the slow pace will shatter many spectators. The film is too long at 158 ​​minutes. <br /> <br /> Having said that, fans who are attentive to the film's sarcasm may want to look again ... using subtitles to better capture the clever ridiculousness of the dialogue. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt heavier than it was. But the comedy could attract your tastes. The film deserves a vision for those who love independent films, fans of director Hal Harley or devotees of Parker Posey (who has time to take more photos).
