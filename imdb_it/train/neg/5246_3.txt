Wow, the most spooky thing about this episode was the price of houses 40 years ago. I state that I am not a fan of the narrated episodes. If the story / actors / etc. worth it, they should be able to transmit most of the story without having to read it, they reminded me of characters who can't think badly, but rely on teleprompters. The psychopath was boring and boring, but some enjoy that kind of thing, it's not just my cup or tea. They could have kept the narrative but at least made it more credible and interesting if it came from a psychiatrist or maybe a journalist or something. Little things like Peugeot's at home, which has a unique circular driveway, yet it seems to have parked its car on the tree in which it was located, because you can't see it anywhere on the road or on the property. Sloppy editing, as he enters the driveway (for what seems like the 100th time) exactly who are those 2 guys you see at 24m30 walking towards the car as he enters the driveway of the deserted house? Even the close-ups of the dollies have been exaggerated, like the Jr. High Drama student who first discovered the zoom function on his camera. I could continue to choose separately, but it could be almost as boring as this episode. He kept dragging on and the real purpose seemed to be to use absolutely all of the repertoire material they'd shot on Elaine driving the Newport convertible. I expected to see the Chrysler logo and a nice jingle game while a voiceover told us all about the 8 track player, the automatic top, etc. The only good thing I have to say about this is that it ends abruptly. No loose ends tied, nothing explained or solved. Not that many people were aware of it, I suspect that most had already changed channels or dozed off in the end.
