Vovochka is your hooligan movie vs everyday authority. Vovochka, the main character, is marked early as a bad influence on neighborhood children. With the words of wisdom of a couple of adults he meets along the way, he finds it difficult to change his mischievous ways, but worthy of doing. Personally, I found an actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize, but the change in tone of the film would have allowed Vovochka to feel the emotional struggle when he wanted to be good, but bad things still happen. This fight makes the film a little different from other films of the same genre, this is the little taste I meant. All in all, I didn't really care about this movie, although it was probably intended for a younger audience.
