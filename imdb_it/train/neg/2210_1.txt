This was a really fun movie. <br /> <br /> Every 1 in the film was trying to be serious, that's what made this movie so funny. I mean, come on the head of a shark on a human body. It can become more fun. Good Sci-Fi job to stage comedy movies. I never thought that movies could be more retarded. If they continue like this, they will have to rename the sci-fi channel of the comedy ski channel or something like that. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next successful sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> I'll be ready with a bowl of popcorn and a crate of beer or a bottle of liquor and I'll be ready to laugh again !!!
