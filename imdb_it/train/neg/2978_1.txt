I'm a big fan of horror movies, and zombie movies are one of my favorites. That being said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. So, needless to say, I loved it, it's the best bad movie I've seen in a long time. The story has some similarities with "Return of the Living Dead" by Dan O'Bannon, but while that movie was intentionally funny, this is the opposite. He has some of the most ridiculous performances I've ever seen, especially from the scientist's main character. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. Furthermore, the effects are scarce and in many cases neglected, and the scenes of death are often simply stupid. This obviously makes it even more fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene in which the boy opens the refrigerator door and sees the zombie cut head, which then opens his eyes and somehow FLIES THE REFRIGERATOR (obviously drawn inept with a bit of string) , clinging to the neck guys, killing him. Do zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? Challenge every law of physics known to man, and it is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. This is just one of the many really stupid moments in the idiotic chaos. I can't believe he got such a high score here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and rent it.
