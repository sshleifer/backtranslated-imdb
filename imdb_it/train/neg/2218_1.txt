I admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, almost 30 years after the making of this film and, at the time of its creation, it may have been a brilliant horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> Starting with Halloween 1968, six-year-old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is engaged in a psychiatric institution and 15 years later he escapes and returns to his hometown to kill again. <br /> <br /> From this point it is clear that the film will follow a highly predictable basic and rudimentary path. The beginning of each scene is easily predictable in the way it will end, while the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the film, thus alerting the viewer of the likely events to follow. <br /> <For the horror / thriller, there is a serious lack of blood / gore compared to today's films, although I am not similar to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier way could have been found. <br /> <br /> For half an hour at the film, no scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror / thriller movie is quite typical of the era and therefore has no impact on today's enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> A positive for the film are its persuasive shots and dark lights that create a terrifying atmosphere. A positive second would be the character of Michael's doctor, who gives clues to the probability of where the story could lead. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the early stages of her acting career and therefore fails to provide a truly scared central victim. <br /> <br /> It is difficult for me to classify this film as it was in his time, but from other horror / thriller films of the 80s and, to a lesser extent, in the 90s, it is far from a truly exceptional horror / thriller film. I suggest you go ahead and find a classic from the 80s. Greetings!
