I may not have been the biggest fan of Blair Witch, but I still appreciated this effort, so I was looking forward to Alter, especially after reading the superlatives launched in various IMDb comments. "Unique", "intelligent", "A classic cult future" and so on ... you have to ask yourself where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort. <br /> <br /> Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak film that fails to engage in any and all respect. Stupidity is not fun. Horror and blood are not scary. And whatever the "thinking" aspect that some scholars have seen in this film are due to serious disappointment because there is nothing profound or intelligent about this mess. <br /> <br /> OK, so we don't know that anything stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately no. For beginners, play very badly. It is not a time to say that most B-series movies these days have better acting. The plot? Boring and messy windows of dialogue? Many amateurs actually do better. <br /> <br /> It's really the direction of that puzzle. I didn't expect much improvement compared to Blair Witch, but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsened over time, completely unaware of previous experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major flaw in Altered, it is the main set. An important part of the plot takes place in one place, where the main characters are confined, but Sánchez has failed to give place to any personality. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays an important role and it is as much a character (an antagonist, if you like) as the three students, you would think that the director would realize that the same thing was needed here. But no ... this place has no personality of any kind thanks to the sloppy management and no attention to detail. <br /> <br /> There is nothing salvable here. The tough fans of "Blair Witch" will do better to follow Daniel Myrick. Although his production is anything but golden, he shows a better structure than Sánchez's and some Blair Witch lessons are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).
