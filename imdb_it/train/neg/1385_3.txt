"Hak Hap", or "Black Mask" (in English) was a disappointment. I was told that it was a kind of "Japanese version of the Matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The film was either nicknamed or the soundtrack didn't have much time with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty bad. There has been little reflection in the English version of this film and it only appeals to the "meaningless action" genre. It is not a film I would like to see again.
