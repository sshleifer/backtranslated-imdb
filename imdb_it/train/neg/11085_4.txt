TYSON <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Reverent - even if scrupulously correct - report of the life and times of the sample of Mike Tyson boxing. Given his conviction for a rape accusation, the film takes care not to portray him as a hero or a villain, but paints a portrait of all his ascents to fame, the pressures of success and the people who have shaped his destiny for good or bad. Limited by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, briefly descending on significant events, culminating with the (temporary) fall of Tyson in 1995. The novices will be illuminated by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by the director Uli Edel closer approach to the material. He describes Tyson's life as a circus in which he was eventually led astray by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson's ex-wife, Robin Givens, who characterizes her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety. The production values ​​are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: Michael Jai White makes a fair imitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres of tight teeth; and Paul Winfield is certainly born to play Don King!
