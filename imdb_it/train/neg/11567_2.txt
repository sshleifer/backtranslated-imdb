I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless ads for the BBC in the weeks before the start. I looked at it although I didn't like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes (I'm sorry for his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor's new clothes with this author's work). I admit that the acting is excellent, it's wonderfully revived and I was reasonably amused by this - however - I discovered that the plot was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes he felt very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The "explicit" gay sex that the media kept talking about was done first on TV - many times - so I didn't have anything very shocking. Full marks for production values, but low ratings for plot / content I fear.
