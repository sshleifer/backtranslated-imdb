A sad and sad sight is The Munster's Revenge. The Munsters were brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to return to the role of Herman Munster) in this TV movie about a couple of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots that " they terrorize "the city as preparation for a robbery with a mummy in an exhibition. With the police on their heels, the two old television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes to clear their names. We see that they dress as a waiter (a small peak in the film), the grandfather turns into a bat with the thread attached a couple of times (once he even flies to Transylvania with Herman who somehow invokes his frequent flyer miles I think) , and a more annoying relative "the Phantom" sings and breaks glass constantly at every sickness! What is sadder is difficult to identify: Gywnne (above all) and Al Lewis seem so twisted in every scene and so indifferent to the material. They are the hockey costumes of the robots that have the values ​​of school production on them. Maybe it's the ridiculous script. The strange antics of Sid Caesar, mostly not funny. Or maybe he is seeing something that has brought me joy and fond memories like a child being treated for a super-change of K-Mart fashion. In any case, the result is decidedly disappointing and foolish even by Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in a more empty role (although she shows more split than usual for a woman of her years and experience). K. C. Martell always makes an Eddie Munster not affable. Jo McDonell is a charming Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the nicknamed Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd way. The film looks really cheap even for a movie made for TV.
