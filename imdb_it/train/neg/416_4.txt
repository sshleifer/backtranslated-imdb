(some spoilers) - as if you didn't know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOLLOW MAN were high. A great spot, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, as well as a very interesting theme - invisibility. Every premise for a great film has been made. Unfortunately these things did not matter. The film was very long week, without suspense and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It is a group of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After animal testing, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. Once it is invisible, it changes completely, realizing the advantages of not being seen. From this to the murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a sick movie. He suffers from the disease that many new films have: special effects. From a stimulating theme that could have led producers to a great, tense psychological thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything by focusing only on special effects, without worrying about the true value of the film. I have to admit, fx is fantastic, probably the best I've seen from the Matrix, but it's not enough to make a good movie. In reality this is the problem with movies today. Just like in Verhoeven, most filmmakers only care about spectacular scenes and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is ​​the only film that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and fantastic plot. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven still disappoints. Instead of a great movie, HM is cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. special effects 2. joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I don't want to spoil this moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Ok, so what did it go wrong in the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- Not at all tense. It should be, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It's too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological side, Verhoeven is only interested in the effects. <br /> <br /> - - Many clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Obviously the villain wakes up a couple of times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- Just like in any low quality horror, the first rule is to let the villain characters separate as much as possible. Every time there is someone alone in the laboratory, perfect victim for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: at the beginning, Bacon must scan the finger to enter the laboratory. After he is invisible, how can he do it? <br /> <br /> --- The ending: absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon on the head, Bacon falls to the ground. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. It's normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, "kills" him again. And then Shue screams "I heard an explosion" (it happened a few minutes ago), and suddenly they ran inside. Didn't you hear that explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There is a scene where you can see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected a lot more from you! <br /> <br /> So this is about Hollow Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a scam. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
