When you go to an outdoor cinema under the Greek summer night you usually don't care what the movie is! Edison started really well with a good effort from the singers, from those who would like to be actors and a great Morgan Freeman, but ... (In a film there is usually a good start to capture the audience, done, a bit boring yet the story fills halfway through the movie which is more about the characters and less about the action, done, and the third part is something really good, so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 agents of elite police (full of weapons that can demolish a building) shoot a guy behind a car, fail to hit him once even as he kills everyone (but 3) and then the boy pulls out a flamethrower (to kill the rest 3 ), you realize that the Greek summer the sky full of stars is too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
