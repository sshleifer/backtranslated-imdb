I didn't really like this movie and left during the scene where the loyalist band was caught by the British. The film actually blames NI people as the cause of their problems. It suggests that the 25-year war was a matter of intransigence and nothing to do with the division of Ireland by Britain and the domination of its history, or NI was created by Britain in 1921 regardless of the wishes of rest of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, although I scorn the loyalist paramilitaries who were fighting for a cause, keeping their artificial privileges on the Catholic community. It is known that British intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep Catholics at bay and demoralize republicanism. <br /> <br /> The values ​​of the Nineties on "machismo", masculinity, etc. They are transposed in the 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the so-called Irish "psyche" that leads to violence. The stupid song of the woman of the club - the old Ireland of the green fields ... insignificant ... - has a symbolic stature, that is to say poor young imbeciles who fight for an impossible cause. Boring, ahistorical, cheap and unpleasant. O'Sullivan made a personal statement about a conflict that requires serious political analysis.
