I can't describe how terrible this movie is. Am I the only one here who finds the way his animated is totally disgusting? Rohan's men look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, which doesn't even come close to matching with the actors. The orcs seemed terrible. Why does Gandalf walk with an ugly lameness? Why can't they pronounce things correctly? Saruman is not Aruman. There were others that looked like terrible * sp * pronunciations of Tolkiens characters. All in all I am glad that the studio that did this pulled the plug from the sequel, it was just a terrible terrible adaptation. Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon than Tolkiens' work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better than this dribbling. 2/10
