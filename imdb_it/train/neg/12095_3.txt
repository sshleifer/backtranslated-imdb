Elfriede Jelinek, not yet a household name, is a Nobel Prize winner for literature. His novel generated a film that won second prize at Cannes and first prize for male and female protagonists. Are they a dinosaur on the subject of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that something goes? <br /> <br /> 'Gobble, gobble' is the preferred spelling representation in Britain of the bubbling noise produced by a turkey. In the world of cinema, a turkey is a monumental flop, measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners. <br /> <br /> The embarrassing horror of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It starts very badly, as if it were done to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt irrelevant scenes for more than 11 minutes. Professor Erika Kohut is presented to us, apparently the alter ego of the acclaimed author, a stone piano professor. He lives with his hoarse and overbearing mother. Dad is an institutionalized madman who dies invisible during what passes for action. <br /> <br /> Reviewing the pianist is difficult, beyond the recording of his unpleasantness. What we see in the film (and which I could read in the book, as far as I know) is a flashy, exploitative, meaningless tale of an emotional pendulum that oscillates here and there without going on. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with an intense musical sensitivity, but otherwise totally removed. Not really, because there is a purse at two steps of the scene with its maman of very serious appearance, which ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotiv (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do it), the violently alternating moods of Elrika would be. <br /> <br /> A young boy, Walter, studying to become a "low-voltage" engineer, whatever it is, and playing ice hockey in his few moments of leisure, is also a talented pianist. Meet Elrika in an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the casual fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts 'cherchez la femme'. <br /> <br /> Repressa Erika has a weakness for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a handkerchief taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches. <br /> <br /> Walter performs a brilliant audition and is reluctantly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterized by distance, hostility, discouragement and humiliation. <br /> <br /> He soon declares his love and soon pursues Erika in the Ladies where they engage in a gentle panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika maintains control over her love in love. He promises to send him an instruction letter for further pleasant exchanges. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, jealously jealous of Walter's kindness towards a nervous student who is literally pooping before a dress rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the student's coat pocket with the broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano hands. <br /> <br /> The next scene (overcoming genital mutilation, etc.) Has the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika wants to be humiliated, tied up, slapped, etc. Sensitive Walter is, for the moment, rejected and marches into the night. <br /> <br /> At this point there is still almost an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks Walter to the ice rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retreat to a back room. Lusty Wally can't resist the hands that pull his pants. His "baby gravy" is soon expelled with other stomach contents. I have buzzing. <br /> <br /> Rejected but hooked, perhaps eager for revenge for the insult so recently done with his mouth open on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It is not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. A moment she is closing her mother in her room and slapping Erika, the other one kicks her in the face, has sex with her and renews her declarations of love. <br /> <br /> Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the movie if you want, but I would advise you not to do it. <br /> <br /> Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if it is in the right mood. I could expatriate the difficult representation of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted to. But I prefer not to do it, because this is an economic and obnoxious film that appeals to the basic instinct and says nothing. I would have to say that the Erika removed by kinship out of love, tries ineffectively in pornography, refuses inappropriately when it appears literally, pink and throbbing, under its nose, belatedly realizes that it does not like being hurt, blah, blah , blah. <br /> <br /> The world has, for unexplained reasons, stunned her. Apparently he creates a monster from someone who appeared superficially affectionate - but surely we all know that every man is potentially a violent rapist, because this is his essential nature, however much he tries to say to himself and the world otherwise. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you have the patience to be there, there is a small turning point. Before going to the final scene, where she must perform as a replacement for the student who dirty her underwear with torn hands, Erika puts a knife in her bag. For Walter? <br /> <br /> Yes, you are in front of me. He slips into an area that does not threaten life and leaves. Roll credits. <br /> <br /> If this earned the second prize at Cannes, how bad were the other entries?
