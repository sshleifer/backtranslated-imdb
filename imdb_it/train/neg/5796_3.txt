I saw this film as part of the Asian American Film Festival in New York and I was horrified by the sadomasochistic graphics of the child pornography I witnessed. The plot is hidden under too many graphic sex scenes - and, none is the least erotic - the feeling is sicker. The director seemed to have a shock value rather than exploring the various levels of why these characters are like this. See if you can stand it - I still have flashbacks.
