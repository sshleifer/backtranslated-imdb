I happened to see this film on the shelf under "new releases" and found the idea of ​​a hip-hop zombie movie too interesting to give up. That's how it was charged to the box, however, and I thought to myself, "What a great idea!" In addition, the words "Welcome to Oakland" are also on the cover. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part only lasted for the opening theme. Neither hip-hop nor hip-hop music played a very important role in the film. Having lived in Oakland alone, I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there, so the low budget of this film was no excuse for not having an adequate soundtrack. Any number of artists in difficulty would have taken the opportunity to contribute to this film. Because the Quiroz brothers have not taken advantage of it is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Once the film developed, it was a typical zombie movie with a cast that was completely black and Latin. You might think this would have put an unusual bias on the film ... but it is not. In some ways, Quiroz Brothers' vision of "urban culture" is reduced to guided shootings and the fall of an F bomb in every line of the film. The rapid use of the word "fuck" is probably the distinguishing feature of this film; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I'm not at all picky about a film's oath, but the feeling is that it was the result of a lack of ideas by writers (even the Quiroz brothers), and the script was generally very poor. br /> <br /> The film was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a genuinely zombie movie "urban culture", but "Hood of the Living Dead" gave no results. The characters in the film could just as easily be white or Eskimo or whatever. There was no distinct taste in the film. It's just another low-budget film, with bad acting, bad writing, amateur direction, bland cinematography, an economic soundtrack, and absolutely nothing to recommend.
