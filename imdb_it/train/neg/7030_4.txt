One of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is to take a well-known classic storyline and make it a complete slavery. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. The writer takes the plot from Phantom of the Opera and transfers it to a shopping center in the late 1980s. However, the "Phantom" goal is simply to take revenge on those responsible for disfiguring his face and killing his family. The special effects provide a good laugh, especially when the parts of the body begin to appear in the yogurt dishes. Pauly Shore has a small role that doesn't allow him to be as obnoxious as you'd expect, especially since his fifteen minutes of MTV fame hadn't arrived yet. If you're looking for some good laughs at the expense of the special effects actors and crew, watch this movie. Otherwise, keep looking for something else.
