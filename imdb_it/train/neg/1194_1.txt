I have seen many movies in my life, but not many like this. It's a movie that makes fat people fun, it doesn't have a true story, it has bad actors, it's not funny and more. Is it a movie you would like to see? I guess not! <br /> <br /> I believe the creators of the film were trying to be original and creative, but it looks like it was made by a 12-year-old with absolutely no cinematic skills. So-called fun parts are fun like churning out pies in people's faces or breaking the wind. Courtesy if this is the kind of humor you like, then this is the movie for you !! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie!
