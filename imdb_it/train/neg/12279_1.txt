Although this seems to be quite an old show (2002), I saw my first episode ever last night and I must say that it must be the worst show. . . never. <br /> <br /> I am not one for the comments, but I was so shocked that there could be a show that brazenly tries to accommodate, and I only assume that this was their target audience, children under 12 years old or people with an IQ lower than the average. <br /> <br /> The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disconnected plot lines, tried to include EVERY Summary of imaginable plot and while trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and policy !!!. <br /> <br /> The basic story they covered in the episode: Frat House Hazing went wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death turns out to be the son of the senators who wants the FBI to investigate. Death is actually a homicide for peanut allergy The Senator thinks he could be his sworn enemy and the best childhood friend who did this because the senator was taking money for his legislation votes but eventually he got a conscience and said "no" to mean millionaire mulit. All suspects, but everyone has the usual alibi (the former girlfriend of the girlfriend who discovers a married teacher had to lie, a dissatisfied student who was reported by the victim actually had a life-changing experience, the enemy senator did not he paid the desperate student to kill the enemy sworn son, he gives money free to many broken students). All the while the heroine of this dribble has the niece who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy, who eventually gets the courage to speak with the assistance of his aunt, but only to download it because the "inside" the girls say that she is not good enough and so to stay with them she downloads it. Don't worry, come back with the boy after he learned the truth about life and the girls "inside" abandon it, Aunty also explains that God is the only one she can count on (I was almost sick at this point). <br /> <br /> This "drama" gets even better when Sue and her FBI team discover who the murderer is. . . you'll laugh at this, I really am. . . <br /> <br /> He is one of the Frat brothers who only a year ago discovered he was adopted and that his real father is an international terrorist and is trying to impress the real dad by killing a boy and placing a bomb at funeral. . . . . . . <br /> <br /> The characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard Anyone who says they love this show has cardboard for a brain <br /> <br /> Because the writers of this show has tried to package EVERY eventuality in a show means that obviously they have no confidence in the development of the character or in the ability of the actors to carry out a simple plot. Watching this show is like watching "Last Action Hero" with Arnie killing 5,000 people with a toothpick, except that Arnie is a better actor (wow, I never thought there would be a day I would have said it !! ) <br /> <br /> In the words of the dear Simpsons comic book character. . . . <br /> <br /> WORST TV SHOW. . . . . NEVER.
