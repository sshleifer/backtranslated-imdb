The stereotyped sending of slasher movies is very short, as expected for entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and indeed the entire cast are totally wasted. Lame's lines abound and every line is well wired. The stupid liners arrive at a fast pace and almost all fall flat like crushed grapes. The musical numbers only contribute to the boredom that insinuates and lingers for the entire film. Another negative aspect is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid it and look for one of the really fun "Lampoon" movies like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - MERK
