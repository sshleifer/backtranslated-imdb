this film was absolutely not what I expected. <br /> <br /> if this film was called anything else nobody would notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> it's really weird because I can't see the point. the prequel and the sequel only let it be said that it doesn't make sense, the don't even match. perhaps I am naive but it is not a vol 1 & vol 2 thought to match it. <br /> <br /> carlito was in prison in the 1st and dies in the original, and in the prequel lives and does not go to prison. <br /> <br /> the plot was OK, but they should have changed around some actors and part of the plot and the name of the movie and it would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end like the other one. <br /> <br /> if someone has an opinion on this post, please.
