Allegedly a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s, "Nightmare" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with fake accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most South American Americans, this vulgar piece of work looks like a newly disguised "in prison" movie - especially in its original untrimmed version. However, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job in making the spectators hate him, even if he seems somewhat uncomfortable in different scenes. There is also a change of pace for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lascivious guardian, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") made a sadistic guard of the rather credible prison. My vote: D. <br /> <br />
