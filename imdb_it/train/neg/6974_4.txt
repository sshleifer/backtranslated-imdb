The blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but not in any way that makes sense. At some point, some children are wandering through the deeper levels, exploring. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they will find there and one of them (a girl) says he bets that they will find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, that's right. Totally insignificant to the story, the only sad link to the title, and no idea why it was supposed to find a blue monkey in a hospital basement. <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed to have remembered it but someone had to remember, I suppose!
