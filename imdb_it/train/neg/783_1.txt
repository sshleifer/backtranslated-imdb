I saw this show and simply didn't find it funny at all. It may have been the first episode. Lately I realize that the ABC is playing a lot of stupid shows nowadays and is becoming a station. All the characters in this show are rather bad actors, but even if they were good, the jokes and the scripts are pretty horrible and they would continue to bring the show. I would say that I think this show will be canceled, but since ABC is doing a horrible job because of the quality of the shows they are playing, they could simply maintain this simply because it's average to them.
