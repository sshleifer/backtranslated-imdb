What the hell was D-Movie? Bad acting, bad special effects and the worst dialogue / plot I've ever seen. The only interesting thing was Coolio, who had a nice cameo like a crazy cop. However, the rest of the film is terrible and boring. It's not even that bad, you can laugh. Just sucks. And anyone who compares this with the Evil Dead Series could compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 in 10
