I really have problems with this movie. It's brilliantly directed, obviously there's a lot of money. Gere and Danes are intense (although his screen personality could use a little more definition and spelling up), editing and cinematography are excellent. On the other hand, it is one of those really very sick movies where you can't help but wonder if the director himself likes to play specific scenes, and, yes, you can't help but wonder how many scripts will inspire a gender. /> <br /> In purely artistic terms, it's a 9, but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce a film like that ....
