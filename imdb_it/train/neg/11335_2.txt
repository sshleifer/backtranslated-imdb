I recently saw the Belle Epoque, thinking it could be wonderful because it won an Oscar for best foreign film. I was a little disappointed with the predictability and simplicity of the film. Perhaps the conflict I had was that from the moment the film was shot so far, the plot of a man who falls in love with beautiful women and who eventually falls in love with the good girl has been done so many times. Apart from the predictability of the plot, some scenes from the movie really seemed out of place with the plot (for example a certain event at the wedding). Sometimes the film was a bit verbose in its ideas and in relation to the era of Franco the film was set and the Church. The only thing the film had in store were the cute moments, the scenery and the character of Violeta who was a strong and independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics.
