This film is nothing but a well-defined series of tension sequences, punctuated by an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. In reality, there is no character development and no real storyline to talk about. There are only the most skeletal motivations for the characters to do anything as they trudge to their inevitable dooms. It's just an excuse to show a scary ghost boy (who seems to have confused some of the family cat in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with long black hair that covers her face like "The Ring") take a lots of cardboard excuses, two-dimensional excuses for human characters. <br /> <br /> This English version of "The Grudge" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food; satisfying momentarily, but not quite what you should live on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
