Although I can see the potentially redemptive qualities in this film through his intrigue, I certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure turned out to be too much to ask for most viewers. Huge holes in the script like the never explained "your father died today", his mother's comment made it even more difficult to try to make sense of these characters. <br /> <br /> He won the first prize at Cannes in 2001, it is a shock considering. Perhaps the Frenchman had been hungry for film noir that year and desperately wanted something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when it was combined with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me away from history. <br /> <br /> This is a film only for the most passionate fan of film noir and one that does not expect any gratification from having seen a movie once it is finished. I loved films like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which were much more disturbing, but which at least gave the viewer something in terms of editing and rhythm. Watching this teacher slow and painful silence scene by scene has become so redundant that I found it boring - and I really wanted this movie so much at every turn.
