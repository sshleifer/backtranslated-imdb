Look at the 1936 version. How personally annoying I find the voice of Charles Boyer, it's more like a couple paying for a cosmopolitan and depressed Rudolf - I mean that Omar Sharif tries but, no - too cute and vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old doesn't look like Marie - nothing! It seems too sophisticated to think of dying for the sake of this man in this way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire film to convey the role they are playing is Ava Gardner, whose appearance is Empress Elisabeth on the screen is suitably short (and look at the images of the empress there is more of a passing resemblance) as historically, the empress Elizabeth was not involved so much in Rudolf's life.
