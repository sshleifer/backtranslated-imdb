The author leaves for a "journey of discovery" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the film "Bright Leaf" (completely and deservedly forgotten) speaks of one of his ancestors. It is not, and indeed does not discover anything of even slight interest in this glorious, utterly silly and self-indulgent home movie, suitable for screening (of the director) for drunken family reunions, but certainly not for a commercial or even non-commercial version . A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by mainstream studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and uninteresting to anyone other than the director and his immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
