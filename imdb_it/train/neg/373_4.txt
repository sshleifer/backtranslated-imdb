Blank Check is a film that I watched on TV one day and like most of the movies shown on TV, Blank Check wasn't that great. First of all, no one who has ever met has seen Blank Check and this includes people who grew up in the 90s. Even Blank Check will not be remembered in the '00s or simply because it will be obscured by Pixar's films. I wouldn't call Blank Check a bad movie, but it's not even funny. (Or at least it's not for anyone over the age of 6). Blank Check is not a funny film because nothing is original. Everything just makes you go "what didn't I see before?" Blank Check rips away and tries to cash in everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (which strangely both have Macaulay Culkin in it). Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to vanish in the dark.
