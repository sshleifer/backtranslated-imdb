Although 99.99% of the people who have seen this film are Brazilian, I will keep up with English because it is the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This film is a piece of cr * p . Worse acting I've seen for a long time. Children are terrible. Especially the boy. It was the first time I saw someone with less facial expressions than Arnold Schwarzenegger and a single voice, like a 5-year-old boy reading in front of the class. How can such a bad person be the main actor in a film? The plot is so shallow that my daughter could have done better (she is 3 years old). It is so simple that it could be written in a napkin and said in 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities for someone to enjoy this movie: 1) you are a pre-teenager; 2) you have been so brain-washed by the stupidity of Globo that you think everything that has the seal of the Globe is fantastic; 3) you have severe brain damage. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs! A pity for the Brazilian cinema scene.
