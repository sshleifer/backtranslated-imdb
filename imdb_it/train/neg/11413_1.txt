Seriously - avoid this movie at any cost. I just saw it in my first "preview" ever and although I paid non-refundable money for it, I left the cinema after only 15 minutes. That already includes 2 minutes of discussion between my friends whether to leave or not. The first time I ever left a movie. And I've experienced some pretty bad ones. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films that is nicknamed (and worse) even if it is shown in its original language. It is based on the oldest, simplest and most economical jokes in the book. In the military ("What do we do once we reach the combat zone?" - "Get out of the car and die", actually it's much more fun to read here as it was made in the film), on drugs (a boy eats some) space cookies ", behaves in a really stupid way and misses his marriage or has to survive while he is tall - all written and badly performed), on women in the army (" Why we only receive trumpets? guns! "-" That's it, so that it will remain ") ... Argh. Ok, you could really find them really funny, but in this case you really scare me. <br /> <br /> Also, I've seen better acting in the genre of soft porn movies you receive on European TV late at night. So he had lame jokes (badly delivered), beyond the lower average acting, lacked pace, was dubbed and badly edited? It just didn't work. At least not at any level used as a measure for movies. <br /> <br /> I would even be so bold as to say that this film shows that there are people who can be far less funny than zan zee Germans. And this is saying something if you like stereotypes. (That I don't, it's nice to play with them though. In case someone thinks it's not enough PC.) <br /> <br /> Instead of going to see this movie, do something useful. Try teaching shrimp crochet, paint your toenails in a really irritating color, disassemble your bicycle, change some light bulbs, try to understand Einstein's theories, convert into a different religion and come back - in fact, go and listen "Last Christmas "by Wham! in infinite repetition. Whatever, but don't watch this bad movie.
