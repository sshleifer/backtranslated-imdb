STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Twitch (Kurupt) has long been transferred to a harder prison compared to the re-opened Alcatraz. He says he will be closer to his lady, but his real reasons are a little grander. There he meets Burke (Bill Goldberg), a bulky prisoner who can take care of himself. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is equally a mouthpiece and is practically the same. But there is a gang war between black and Hispanic detainees that explodes in a hostile capture of the prison when the leader of the black gang is killed to death and his finger points to Burke. But the sh! T really hits the fan when the real murderer and leader of Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter hostage. Steven Seagal makes no sequel (reportedly very opposed to the idea of ​​Under Siege 2 and only agrees to do so on condition that the film company he was with at that time directed his film), so despite this being a DVD sequel, the This time main role goes to Bill Golberg (Steve does not even appear in some of the stock films of the first film that appears towards the end.) But there is a reason why he didn't do much work from Universal Soldier 2 and this because he didn't he is very much an actor, and he is not even an action star, managing a character that starts out as very dark and gloomy but turns into a standard action hero, embarrassed, mimicking the one-liners a little boringly. Wise supporters, veterans of the first film, Kurupt and Tony Plana, simply took the opportunity for an extra job. <br /> <br /> This is a film that has tried to copy the style of the original quite well, with soft lighting, dark shadows and rap music that plays a lot. He does it quite well, unfortunately he can't contend with a non-addictive hero, an equally cardboard thug and an apathetic story that the producers do a lot seem to have invented as they went on. **
