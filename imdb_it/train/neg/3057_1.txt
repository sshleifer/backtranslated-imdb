While "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" is usually cited as one of the worst films ever made, this film made in Mexico since 1959 is so bad as to make "SCCM" look like "It's a wonderful life". One has to wonder what the people who made this film thought; perhaps they meant it as an allegory of the third world on capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. No. . . They weren't very good. The same production company has created an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood" in which the obsession of the wolf with our heroine has indisputable hints of pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the inspiration for "Freeway".) Return to "Santa Claus": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geostationary orbit of the earth (shades of "MST3K"); instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from all over the world; and he had sophisticated espionage equipment to check which kids were bad and funny. The result is like an Orwellian sweat factory. It's enough to make you leave Christmas forever. This and other films for low-income Mexican children were dubbed into English and widely distributed in the United States in the early 1960s; no wonder the 1960s have become such a turbulent time in American history. The baby boomers who have been forced to endure these "familiar" children's films would be all too eager to become revolutionaries.
