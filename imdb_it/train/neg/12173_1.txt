My friend and I rented this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! <br /> <br /> My friend and I also count 475 face blows. (Which constitutes 95% of the film). <br /> <br /> So, in other words: SEE THIS FILM, UNLESS YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR MONEY! And I do it! <br /> <br />
