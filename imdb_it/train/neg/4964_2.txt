This film is a farce! The names are grossly poorly pronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the guts to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon / crossbow weapon. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! In the poem, he tears off Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can't believe that the writers did something like that. However, the way Grendel portrayed is impressive. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go crazy if he saw this abomination. Unless you are a passionate fan of the epic "Beowulf", avoid this movie at all costs. And even then, I wouldn't recommend it.
