Banned as "Video Nasty" in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found on the film was his amateur in all departments. The drain that I could handle: the terrible acting, the poor editing, the terrible direction, the horrible script and the abysmal soundtrack were much more difficult to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls traveling to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm. They are saved by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The host, an old mad woman and her spinster daughter, welcome the girls, allowing them to stay for a few days to recover. However, someone does not want girls to ever leave! One by one they fall victim to an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> Taking a long time to go ahead and present some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and this takes a while to do), Unhinged is really a terrible movie. Music is a total disaster (it seems that a three-year-old child has been released on a synthesizer) and as such, perfectly completes the film. Only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and some free nudity save Unhinged from the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are a complete horror (and unfortunately, I am), you will want to look at this to check the Nasty Video watch list. But be careful, it's really very bad.
