*** Possible plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I wonder why he accepted the role of police detective in 2000 The Spreading Ground. This movie makes me sick and I'm about to tell you why. <br /> <br /> It is a small town that is about to get a contract for a sports arena. A hitch: there is a killer in freedom and this is not good for business. The Mayor signs an agreement with the Irish mafia to find the killer and make sure he never arrives in court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants to capture this boy too, but he is on the level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system do its job. <br /> <br /> It could have been pretty good. It may have been compelling. It was horrible. First, they label this guy as a serial killer. Err no There are specific criteria and none of these fits here. The bad guy killed 5 kids the first day, and I think they were 2 on the second day. The entire film extends over a period of 48 hours .... Action Hardly Serial Killer. I don't care what the deformed motivations that give it to the end, the serial killers do their actions for a long period of time. They don't kill all 7 children in two days. It's a binge. <br /> <br /> Ok apart from that annoying, the acting was atrocious. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who even came close to getting his part out. Unfortunately, he is a cast for me and I think he does psycho parts much, much better. This was not a good vehicle for Hopper. It didn't allow him to do what he does best, which means acting in a gruesome way. It's not that I hurt him, it's that I've seen him do much better. <br /> <br /> Mob's Irish boy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - The long day in the night), who is responsible for their investigation is just above the norm. Contradiction? Not exactly. He's trying to play a cold and tough guy and he does it to the point that the character is just wooden. Boring at most It didn't scare me. It has inspired no emotion but boredom. I can't tell you how many times I've checked to see how much time is left until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that it felt like a TV movie. You know what I mean. Low production values, low budget, re-use of scenes to save costs. Only eh. Yanno? But, I feel like comparing it to those is an insult to those. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was director and director of photography for this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can't help thinking that Hopper must have taken this role as a personal favor for a friend. This is the only rational that I can invent. This was Vanlint's first job as a director, third as a cinematographer. We hope this was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the ending if I decide to torture you with this, but I mean that everyone has dropped the ball here. .. also Hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally devastating to the detective, it was just .. well .. blah. I didn't see any of the anguish that would have accompanied the total change - he changed this guy. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This 100 minutes of exhausting and R nominal for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 will have any interest in watching it, so don't worry. However it is not suitable for anyone. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this. You can thank me later.
