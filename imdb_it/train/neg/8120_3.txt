At least among those films with 100 or more votes. Nominated for the best screenplay written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ?? Nominated for the best image ?? I always disagree with many of the Oscar choices, but this film could be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the Academy. Writing and acting were both horrible. Blethyn's performance in particular was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most oversized acting performance of all time. Horrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or TV channel I've ever played, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful that I didn't pay to see one of the most overrated movies of all time.
