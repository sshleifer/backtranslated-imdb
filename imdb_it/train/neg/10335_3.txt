Medium (and surprisingly docile) Fulci yellow, which means that it is still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid accumulation and some nice touches like a sharp turn on the theme of visions and clairvoyance. <br /> <br /> The well-known weaknesses of this kind are in full force: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. And the ending lasts too long, while the conclusion turns out to be rather boring or I should say: weak deal. <br /> <br /> Fulci's ironic management of the yellow rules is still fun. Yellow clues everywhere you look. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 limping assassins
