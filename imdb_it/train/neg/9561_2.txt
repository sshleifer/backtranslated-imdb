As many others have commented before me here, I must say that this film is bad, but not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct references to plots or movie sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers. <br /> <br /> I had the feeling that I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they got a hold of some extras to spend on CGI (I've seen worse) ... In short, it is an insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge of computers and / or technology at all. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel at ease, and I found myself begging for everything to end - fast - halfway. Furthermore, there are innumerable "easy exit" scenarios, which are also an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being ... <br /> <br /> This film absolutely vanishes compared to the old "Wargames", and I think it is a real shame that they could even call it a sequel. <br /> <br /> Two stars from me, for one thing and one thing: the performances of the actors are not evil, considering the regurgitated shit of a script with which they had to work. However, they should never have signed this film. It's not really a career move, but I suppose we have all the accounts to pay. <br /> <br /> To those of you who have given the highest score to this movie ... you have to be on the payroll of the studio or something, this is my only explanation. <br /> <br /> To all those who have not seen this: by all means, look at it and make your idea. But lower your expectations on the floor (and then on some).
