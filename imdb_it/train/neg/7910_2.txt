I saw most of "My Bollywood Bride" today at the IAAC film festival in New York and I had to leave the theater due to feelings of nausea pouring into me. I saw Bollywood movies and saw satirical Bollywood movies. This film failed to decide which it wanted to be, so it ended up being a joke on itself. <br /> <br /> It seems to have been freely copied from films like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling, and what a sloppy and lazy job to this. How can Bollywood be weaned from its determination to stick to abused and well-beated scripts? Is there anyone who can bring to the screen millions of true and fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people? The astute driver, the cow on the street, free scenes of foreign places, useless scenes of the streets of Mumbai, are all in there. Every possible clich√© on India has been faithfully included. So predictably disgusting. ugh !!! The acting performances are weak all along the line except Neha Dubey, who has talent and beauty. One wonders why he would have chosen a project like this.
