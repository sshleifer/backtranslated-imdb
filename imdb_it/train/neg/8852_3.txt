to be honest, I didn't look at all the original "howls", but those scenes I saw made it clear that the first howl was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started with "Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf". I had this movie on VHS from my uncle some time ago when he was giving away a lot of old movies he bought when Atari was brand new. I just saw it last night, and it wasn't really BAD, it was just weird. I mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three-way with two of his werewolf servants was just out of place and pretty scary (but a little spicy), Christopher Lee is about to stab a dead karen like he's a vampire, etc. , this film was actually a sort of mixture of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except the werewolves, because all that Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) was saying that werewolves were practically robbed by every other film on the vampires in the heart, the garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NOTTE, and the head of the werewolves lives in TRANSILVANIA). not much for acting, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the film I found myself rooting for the werewolves to tear out her throat, because that damned throat always had to say SOMETHING. However, the plot is rather silly and clich√©, so there is no point in telling you, you can simply read on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really makes me sick of this film is the fact that it is the ONLY film among all seven sequels that are somehow related to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't watch this movie. there is no real horror, almost no werewolf, and just a horrible special fx. 3/10
