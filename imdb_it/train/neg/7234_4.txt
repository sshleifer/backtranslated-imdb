In a word: heartbreaking. I was advised to read some articles on the philosophical meanings of this film later, but after interviewing the endless 115 minutes of the film and slowly crushing myself under its inflated symbolism and lava opulence, it seemed better to report my reactions to the film. After all, who's going to watch a movie with a program in hand? And this film was sad. The main actor Claude Laydu, from the opening of the film to its end, wears the same boring and boring mask of agony as to be practically indistinguishable from the eternal and depressing voice-over of the film. Turning one on the other may have worked better than subjecting an audience to both, since they basically say the same thing: Ambricourt's priest is a miserable human being. The story, about a persecuted priest who tries to help a wealthy family in difficulty, does nothing to make his characters remotely interesting or understanding, since the family is a group of unpleasant oddities, and the priest, himself, comes across in a nosy parasite. The last 30 minutes suggest a breathtaking message about the grace and suffering of a man who equals that of others, but because of all the indulgent close-ups of a suffering Laydu and the vague subtext in Robert Bresson's script, all I heard it was finally over, let's have some ice cream. Interesting for fans of the Bresson fanatic, Paul Schrader, only to see how many elements of character and setting Schrader brought to his screenplays and films, in particular "Taxidriver", "Raging Bull" and "Light Sleeper".
