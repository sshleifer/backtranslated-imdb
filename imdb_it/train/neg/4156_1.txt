Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it doesn't take advantage of its very title !! In the film WHOLE, zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice. Furthermore, we are never really sure if the main character of the film is DEFINITELY a vampire. It could be argued that they were trying to "soften" it or make it "realistic", but it ends up being boring. More than half of this film takes place IN A MACHINE. The scenes that take place anywhere else are not much to brag about. Furthermore, there is no clear antagonist and in the end you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> However, I will say that for a low production value film, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with an original score or music sampled elsewhere). <br /> <br /> They are all for independent films, but this does not seem to have been designed for a mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than Scarecrow".
