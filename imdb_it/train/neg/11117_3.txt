Spooks is fun trash, with some well-directed sequences, ridiculous plots and dialogues, and some third-rate actors. <br /> <br /> Many have described that this is an English version of "24", and you can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the weak silly plots, but the execution is much more streamlined, more sexy and suspect, expensive. <br /> <br /> Some people describe the comedy weak as "kind comedy". <br /> <br /> This is a kind of espionage story, the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me a smile every day.
