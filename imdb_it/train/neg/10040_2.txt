... for this film defines a new low in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c ** p must now be compared. <br /> <br /> First of all, the beginning had elements of style ... and if managed well, it could have become a cult classic, a-la pulp fiction or a desi√±as Desi ... but the plot (was there?) begins to twist and at some point completely loses it. <br /> Bring yourself into an unbalanced don with an obsession for English, a smart call center Alec, a femme fiaba who can wear a bikini and a Saree with the same ease, a levitating, man of business that defies gravity and a policeman with a hundred (or were thousands) black cat commandos on their tracks .... good ingredients in competent hands. But this is where I would like to ask the director: Sir, what were you smoking? <br /> <br /> I am sure that this film will be remembered in the annals of Bollywood film production - for what should never be done - to insult the intelligence of the dead brain of film-goers. <br /> <br /> Probably the only thing that redeems in this Desi matrix plus the desperado plus the grindhouse goat is the music ... watch the videos ... listen to the airplay and you won't be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar has invented eminently humble melodies. <br /> <br /> How I wish the director had spent the money to create a little more pleasure for the eyes .... <br /> <br /> As I sign, I really, really want to know how Akshay works the bullet wound disappears in a microsecond ... what were you editors doing? Tashan, maybe ...
