I didn't have high expectations and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed. This movie is so terrible that I felt compelled to register an account here on IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time. The plot is terrible and you keep asking yourself throughout the film "can it be worse?" Yes, it can! somehow they manage to get worse by the minute and you end up thinking "I want my 1 hour and 35 minutes back!". Someone has to pay for it! <br /> <br /> I challenge you to find a movie that is the worst of this ... <br /> <br /> I didn't really have high expectations and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed.
