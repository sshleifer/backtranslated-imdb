Probably one of the most bizarre films on the slasher ever, poorly interpreted and poorly written. <br /> <br /> THE PLOT Five students left during the holidays close a dorm, but someone has drawings on them and starts killing them one by one, the main suspect is the gruesome gardener John Hemmitt played by Woody Roll, or it could be one of the five characters. <br /> <br /> ACTING Not so bad, not so big, apart from Daphne Zungia who dies too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest is pretty boring, even if Laura Lapinski the main heroine at sometimes she has her charm and in the end you feel sorry for her. <br /> <br /> THE KILLS Can not really see why they have banned this, the killings seem fake mostly, a guy has his hand cut in half at the beginning that looks really fake, but the others are rather naughty as a girl gets her head hit by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another is burned alive. <br /> <br /> IN GENERAL It is not really a great coup slasher I would have been much better
