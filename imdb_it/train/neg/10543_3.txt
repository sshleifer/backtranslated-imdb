Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger who specialized in those parts in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> But that's not enough, The First Power is a slashed-up movie that has Lou Diamond Phillips wasted as a Los Angeles police detective. who has a specialization in serial killer capture. Kober is his last catch, but Kober is in league with less power and will unite and make Lou's life miserable for him. Even after Kober received the gas chamber, his spirit returns in all sorts of ways. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson is available as a partner of Lou who encounters a bad end involving a demon-possessed horse and Tracy Griffith as the psychic and Elizabeth Arlen as a nun with insights are around to help Lou. Will he be able to fight forces from the afterlife? <br /> <br /> When the film ends, you don't care anymore. Lou was trapped in a turkey. Maybe the devil made him make this movie.
