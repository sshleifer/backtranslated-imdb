* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes subtitled "Life Everlasting". It is often taken as a reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how this series, once reputable, is dead and buried after this silent and illogical sending. <br /> <br /> There is a "hey kids, let's put on a show air" on this telemovie, which can be captivating in some places. Some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy choosing all the various cameo appearances. The co-writer, co-producer Tom Fontana and his friends tell friends and favorites of other shows, as well as the real characters of Baltimore. <br /> <br /> It is on top of the returns of practically all the TV show members have many casts, your old favorites and even the non-favorites. <br /> <br /> There was always a dagger-type brass knuckle, quality-conscious executive producer, Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious NBC executives who simply wanted a another police prosecution such as "Nash Bridges", which regularly beat "Murders" in the rankings. The pressure told as the show bounced between the compelling realism that neglected its form and the bleak sensationalism that shattered it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for this film, Fontana, co-writers Yoshimura and Eric Overmeyer and director Jean de Segonzac simply threw in the towel. They took the most ridiculous story in the series, surpassed it with a new unlikely and artistically fruitless storyline, and put the burden of bringing the whole mess up to one of the weakest members of the cast. <br /> <br /> In short, it's been a while since the last episode of the show. The former heart of the Baltimore homicide department, Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, is now a mayoral candidate for Kurt Schmoke, and Schmoke himself is a cameo. But this promising start immediately and unlikely takes a tragic turn. <br /> <br /> The spotlight shifts to Giancarlo Esposito in the role of Giardello's son, Mike. A handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the beautiful faces brought late to presumably animate the TV series. But the question for viewers has always been: Is Mike as uncomfortable as Gee's son, or is Esposito uncomfortable in the role? <br /> <br /> To be honest, Esposito does not have the possibility to interpret the main plot without interruption. This is because writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spit on the intelligence of the faithful voters of the show. <br /> <br /> An apparent streaming video was promoted, and then actually seemed to take place, on the Internet. After some falsifications, the detectives arrested a suspicious repellent. But the deputy prosecutor of Zaljko Ivanek, horny and overworked, forgot to present the motions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be later murdered. <br /> <br /> In summary: he forgot to archive the documents because it was not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire legislature of Maryland, the Attorney General of the States United, NBC, TV Court, BBC, AP, Reuters, People, The Sun, Washington Post, New York Times, LA Times, Time Magazine, The Times of London, The Economist, The Johannesburg Mail and Guardian, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World did not call every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case. <br /> <br /> However, the old band of detectives and associates flock to Baltimore to help out. There is a series of talents on display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogues to be distributed, some of them are simply on display. <br /> <br /> Two of the strongest actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally abused, while the time lost on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on advertising. The writers seem to satirize him, introducing Jason Priestley as the last big-time detective. On the other hand, they give Michelle Forbes a very engaging, easy and easy scene. <br /> <br /> There are a few more clever castings, with the current Lieutenant Gary D'Addario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. Guests come from other shows, such as Whitney Allen doing his "impeccable" Miss Sally "from the children's show loved by the inmates of Fontana" Oz ". WBAL TV's Dina Napoli looks like herself. <br /> <br Although amusing, these guests can be distracting, and Ed Begley Jr. actually makes the story in his brief appearance, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich of "St. Elsewhere "by Fontana. He is still a lively character and fits into a hospital environment. Then you remember, St. Elegius was perhaps not an autistic fantasy? <br /> <br /> The most useful cameo reflects the corporate synergy "This film was made when Court TV purchased the reproduction rights to the series. That network contributed with the legal murder Helen Lucaitis, who had interviewed the Homicide team and later appeared on" Oz. "The TV correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, ie plot points for latecomers. <br /> <br /> Although it is so thin that it disappears when it turns sideways, Lucaitis cleverly manages a bit of physical comedy with Esposito. juice in his scenes with Lucaitis who with his usual colleagues. Perhaps those two should have made a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the film unfolds, the cream of the cast rises to the top. a losing script, Andre Br augher and Kyle Secor surpass it. Their performances remind viewers of what made Homicide, for considerable traits, the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the best professionals do their thing; it's just a shame that this movie doesn't give him more chances. The most ardent fans may want to watch this movie anyway, but you can live without it.
