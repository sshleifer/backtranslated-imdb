"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to take place in an immaculate subterranean world, an age long gone, in which the greatest sin a child could commit would be to challenge the law and obtain a traffic ticket. It opens with a young car-loving woman who takes the company from her rival, who pushes her into a car race. That's all for drag-racing: this B-flick is mainly interested in rock'n roll, man! The boys of American International were obviously fond of decent and squared boys who loved to party and yet did not disdain an adult companion. There are some amusing double meanings and fruitful exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we would come out for a bit of fresh air" ... Dad: "Where did you think you would find him, at the bottom of your throat?"), But the ghost comes little late. Short at 65 minutes, the film cheats us with an off-screen car race and a senseless pre-Scooby Doo exposure. However, for fans of nostalgia, some unreasonable fun. ** from ****
