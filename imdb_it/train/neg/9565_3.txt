I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, since it has had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent film I've ever seen. Not once did a plot device show up without me guessing 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety for everything the film did, no intelligence at all behind the scenes. Every intent of typing or typing was so obviously evident that it was impossible to "enter" the film. I found myself laughing at the horribly thoughtful plot, and the muttering attempts to claim the audience, much more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.
