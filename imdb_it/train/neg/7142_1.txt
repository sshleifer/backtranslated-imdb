This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. I was waiting for a good movie, but at least with some fantastic car scenes / races. What I got was nothing. The race scenes have a budget so low that they accelerate to make it look like the cars are "going strong". In one scene, a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in about 4 seconds simply by turning in the round. It's simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real car movie, look at the fast and furious series. They could be a little rough, but 100 times better than this film could ever hope to be. Better yet, just look at Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made I think.
