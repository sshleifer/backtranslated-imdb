Well, then what is it? I found Nicholson's character shallow and unfortunately uninteresting. The character of Angelica Huston has drained my power. And Kathleen Turner is a nasty, not good slut. It's not that I "don't understand". It's not that I don't think some ideas could have led to anything more. This is a film with nothing but the notion that we should accept these ideas, and that's what the film intends to do. That Nicholson falls to Turner is absurd, but then again, it is destined to be. However, this does not seem like a.) Funny, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! This was a waste of my time, so don't let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of your time! With all that being said, the opening church sequence is quite beautiful ...
