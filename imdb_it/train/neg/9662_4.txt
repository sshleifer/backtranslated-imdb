I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Guess what, I didn't do it before looking at TLB, and I have to say that I was very surprised to see the average above IMDb average. I found a total lack of history. You just fell into it (and, unfortunately, not in the way you save Private Ryan made us fall into the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfactory for me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, the wounded soldiers seemed quite realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare to laugh ... Some men are thrown into the air after an explosion, as if they were Olympic gymnasts. A corkscrew in mid-air or a somersault during the first world war is a bit too much for me, especially when it is performed countless times during the film ... <br /> <br /> But the parts that really made me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes that contained close combat. The screaming and screaming German voices ... incredibly funny. They seem to be spoken by a single actor / singer, because they all sound exactly alike, and it sounds like a typical German voice. <br /> <br /> I would definitely NOT recommend this film to anyone, except for people who just want to have a laugh because of their sad and insignificant quality.
