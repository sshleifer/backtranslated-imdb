Extremely complicated and sad. I'm a brilliant boy, but this was too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit from some early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing. Probably better for the US market. GC itself has hinted that this alone has not provided its Oscar and you can understand why. <br /> <br /> Still the sand dunes are beautiful. The nail that pulls is bad. Daddy drunk lawyers is a mystery. Cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to write the ten lines required on this, despite being more than 2 hours long. Thank goodness they shortened it. Of course, we don't get much to the photos, but the last movie we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better and I don't like Johnny Cash. My wife says that George still looks good with a beard and a few extra pounds, so is there ..... I'm almost there? <br /> <br />
