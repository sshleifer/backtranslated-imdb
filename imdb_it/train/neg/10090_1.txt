This film is a joke. I mean a funny joke "ha ha". Why? Because the only saving thing about it was the good laugh I had from the sheer ridicule of an absurd plot, inane and horrible acting. Wow! <br /> <br /> Within this film there are so many unanswered questions ... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are "keepers" of zombies and what is their purpose? Since when did 6 people form a "nation" of zombies? And is mascara smudged black eye "scary" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old child? <br /> <br /> And finally; Why was this film made? Why? why? why? No reply? This is what I thought. <br /> <br /> On the question channel they actually released this comment after the synopsis of the film: Sorry for this movie in advance "LOL. At least they had the decency to do so much!
