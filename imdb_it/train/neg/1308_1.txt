The thing that really makes me talk about this movie (that is, that movie that makes me physically sick) is that someone actually paid for it. There is absolutely no reason for the existence of this film. It's not scary, it's not stimulating, it's not fun, it's not good. It is a cyanide-based sleeping pill. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead and other decent films, making the director's desperation obviously obvious. It's not like any other film ever made; it's much, much worse. The claims of an "extremely shocking end that you will never forget" are the equivalent of a ton of stinking horse droppings. Please never waste your time looking at this piece of garbage, because it could make you sterile. The man who wrote this film should be removed from the list of Writer's Guild members and never allowed to film anything again. Because if he thought THIS was a movie worth doing, he probably didn't have much to offer in the future. Zero stars That Grod has pity on the soul of anyone who is unlucky enough to see it. I'm going to throw up now.
