The idea of ​​the thumb is not so successful the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a variety of reasons. Firstly, I think, Mr Oedekerk has had much less to do with sending the Titanic. Unlike Star Wars, the Titanic film is not (yet?) Become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to resonate with the public. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled with one-off jokes that don't really seem to be tied to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that heroin is not cleaned during the "jump off the ship" scene is not funny. Rather, think only of yourself: "Did I miss something in the original film?" There were too many of these types of baseless jokes (see Arachnid). <br /> <br /> In contrast, the message sent by the ship's designer made a lot of sense and was fun. Also very funny is sending the guy from the movie who wanted to go "faster" like a maniac who ran asking * everything * to be "faster", including the sinking of the ship and himself to be the first to die. This type of joke meant something in the Titanic context and gave Thumbtanic a significant humor. <br /> <br /> The "average" thumb, the faces and voices, are still fun. Props, sets and CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic shows that eccentricity alone will not work, this film still keeps you amused and giggles to the end.
