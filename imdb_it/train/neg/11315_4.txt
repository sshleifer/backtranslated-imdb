Still a bloodsucker for Pyun's aesthetic sense, I liked this film, even though the "unfinished" ending was disappointing. As usual, Pyun develops a distorted sense of humor and Kathy Long's battles are extremely impressive. Beautifully photographed, this has the impression that it was made for the big screen.
