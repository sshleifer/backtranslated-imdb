I don't think anyone sitting and watching this movie would expect anything to appear remotely like a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you've ever been afraid. This doesn't really work at that level, but the cast strives and the film doesn't address one of those happy endings. Story is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan, so that Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) can write a book and bring along his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Their friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure) who works at the American consulate helps them find a home to live in and finds a haunted one. Some 140 years ago in the same house a samurai found his wife who betrayed him and killed both and then committed suicide. Their ghosts still live in the house and when Fletcher arrives it won't be long before strange things happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes ghosts inhabit the bodies of Fletchers and start behaving like the Japanese they were before and Laura starts to flirt with Alex that leads to a relationship. Meanwhile, Ted starts behaving more rigorously and after pouring the soup into Amy's throat, he goes to ask a Monk for help. Unfortunately the ghosts convince Ted, Laura and Alex to play their death scene the way it did 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Kevin Connor, known as a good television director but who first made horror and science fiction films and worked with McClure on some of them. While this never comes close to being frightening or to the developing atmosphere, there are two things that I liked. First, it doesn't have one of those faded terminations where the couple hugs after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a bloody struggle in which everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Secondly, he casts Susan George! I have always been a fan of his even though he was mostly a schlock, but his performances are always top notch. She also usually appears naked who does here in two separate scenes and while she has no classic features she has a unique tomboy look on her and is one of the reasons why she was so popular. But after appearing in stupid films like this, I think I took her out of business or working only sporadically. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and watching the ghosts run around when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worthy of a laugh or two. The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope that George decides to resume his career.
