I won't take too much time here, I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is fantastic. I have all 3 DVDs, I added them to my collection of DVD movie sets. Darkman is up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you understand the point. There is not too good horror, thriller, set there. Many thanks to the whole crew, and get ready to give us the Darkman trilogy. By the way, if you're wondering how I came across this on DVD. I bought it via the internet, it's still region 4, as you know most of the DVD players in the United States are the region 1. If you have a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it's a player of all regions. Just go to configure then choose the desired witch region setting (1-9).
