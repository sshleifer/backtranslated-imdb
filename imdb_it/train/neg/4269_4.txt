Sometimes a premise starts well, but due to the need to exaggerate to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit disorder, it turns into an incongruous disorder. And for three highly respected actors who have done a better job before and after, this is a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> So let's see. Premise: a couple of lovers living in a beautiful house is threatened by a bad cop. Interesting to say the least. Make the intrusive cop disturb a little, why not. It has been well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and is a ticket proven for a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Here lies the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that actually annoys you to bring a real threat to your main characters without ever coming to seem ridiculous, or throwing any semblance at reality, amplifying the shock factor and making this cop so extreme - an ultra bad variation of any super-villain who has hit cinemas since the silent age. <br /> <br /> The producers and directors have chosen the latter. This is the resulting film, poorly made, with actors trying to make heads or tails with the roles they have already experienced before, and nothing more than less.
