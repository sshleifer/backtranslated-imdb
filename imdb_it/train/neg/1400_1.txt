Oh, my God ... I thought CBS prime-time TV shows were the worst <br /> things Gerald McRaney appeared in ... <br /> <br /> Four people have been experimented with a crazed mind control <br /> <br /> computer. That's it, don't rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw this under one of his many titles - "Gray Matter", and it is <br /> <br /> perhaps one of the worst recent memory films. The other <br /> <br /> reviews are right, it's horrible. Never have so many shots appeared on the screen <br /> <br />, NEVER. The cast is horrible, the management <br /> <br /> is horrible and the script is horrible. I can't stress how awful this is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you were a smallpox. <br /> <br /> This is classified (PG) for physical violence, armed violence, mild <br /> <br /> gore, some vulgarity and some adult situations
