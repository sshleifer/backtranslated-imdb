I had to change my opinion about the worst movie in the world after seeing this. AND THIS! <br /> <br /> Make no mistake this movie is horrible. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of reasons: <br /> <br /> hopeless storyline (although based on a true story). Terrible act (what Judge Reinhold thought) Incredible stunts. Childish dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Lack of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Do you get the picture? <br /> <br />
