Probably the worst Bollywood movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> No plot. Development of very small characters. <br /> <br /> Full of silly and useless humor. The whole film was chaotic and without direction. There was no appropriate ending to the story. The airport was shot in a shopping center. <br /> <br /> The same story has chewed over and over again until you want to say "please go ahead!" Even the song and the dance were useless and badly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there have been some hot bods around ... but then most Bollywood movies have it anyway these days. <br /> <br /> Btw I don't come from an Indian background <br /> <br /> 2/10
