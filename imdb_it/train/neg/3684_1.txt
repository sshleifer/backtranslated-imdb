They sell it like a horror movie, it should be a thriller, but I found it rather amusing (comedy? I don't think so), I laughed at the whole film, I think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot. I don't blame the actors, I think they weren't very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad boy". I loved his acting in Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! she is a beauty, and also a good actress, but let's try to be a small target here, the story mm mm ... the mm mm direction ... it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact it is a really boring film, but there is it's a good thing, it's a short film, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME IT WAS 10 MINUTES UNDER THE WATER !!!) <br /> <br /> I just don't know why this movie is rated so high, and in rotten tomatoes, even higher, what's wrong with good, rational and objective criticism?
