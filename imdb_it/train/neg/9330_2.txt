I saw this movie recently and I had more hope. Not so much based on the director, who had never made a film version, but more based on his cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (star of Body double, a masterpiece by Brian De Palma) have all starred in great films. Not together though, and this fact hasn't changed exactly because of this. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that could make it slightly enticing is the selection of the locations in which it was shot. In my humble opinion: don't waste your time on this.
