As one of the few commentators who didn't see the first film, I found this film very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Yes, he has a funny embarrassing humor if you can endure the (very) morally dubious premise. However, it fails abysmally in important areas. There is a subtle and nonsensical storyline involving Gordon Sinclair's generous friend, who may or may not be intertwined in a conspiracy to provide dangerous electronics to Third World countries - probably in free computers ... or maybe not. Vague, long-winded and inconclusive. The lack of a substantial ending is so exasperating and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film seems to be halfway done. <br /> <br /> The suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when you can attend a very attractive female teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) attracted by the unconvincing character of Gordon Sinclair, especially when he rejects his advances. Laughable. It worsens later in the film when it reaches its romantic ambitions and then throws everything away for ideals based on little evidence of ambiguous value. <br /> <br /> Not many movies let me fool you, but I felt my time was stolen.
