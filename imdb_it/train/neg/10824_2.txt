This version is rather insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's tired acting style is completely unsuited to Edward Rochester's daring passion and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored and petulant teenager whose braces do bad! I also cannot believe that they removed the scene of Edward's great marriage proposal from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I appreciate that they have finally used a woman so young and simple to play Jane, a character that should be a worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that is closer to the novel's personalities and passions, please look at Version years' 70 with George C. Scott and Susannah York. York was too old, tall and pretty to play Jane, but no one touched the character of Rochester as Scott.
