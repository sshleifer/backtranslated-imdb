This must be the worst piece of junk I've seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Is Heath Ledger a heartbreaker? He looked deformed. I wish I had known that he and Naomi Watts are an object in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what he saw in him. <br /> <br /> Is Orlando Bloom a heartbreaker? With a bearded beard and deer headlights, I can't say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous me, but Geoffrey Rush seemed like he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /> <br /> Should I feel sorry for the bankrobbers and the killers? This is very different from Butch Cassidy, which was actually a fun movie. It was banal, shy and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced that it would improve. It is not so. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his band are holed up in a border hotel and women and children die because of their presence. It's not funny. But it was fun when they came out of the hotel in armor, because all we could think of was the Black Knight of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say "I'll bite your leg!" We were screaming with laughter, like many other deformed members of the public. When we left, virtually everyone was talking about how long this movie was wasted. <br /> <br /> I might not have paid money to see this disaster (preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never return.
