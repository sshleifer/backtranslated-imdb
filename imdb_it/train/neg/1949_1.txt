The animation looks like it's done in 30 seconds and looks more like a caricature than a character. I've been a Scooby Doo fan since the series was first introduced in 1969. I didn't think much about Scooby Doo animated films, (I'm talking about TV series, not full movies), but some of them were pretty interesting , and I like that most people have found Scrappy Doo as irritating, but this series is pure junk. As soon as I saw the animation and listened to the characters (and use this term roughly), I spoke. Also, Mystery Inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening a box of chocolates to find someone who has already eaten the best, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants . What's new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you're going to have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that made the series last so long. The whole cast of characters and quality animation. They need to put this back under the rock where it came from.
