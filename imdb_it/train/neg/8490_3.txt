This was a nice attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to overcome low budget traps. The use of virtual sets works almost, but in some places it fails miserably. I guess they made good use of the small budget. I just want the story and most of the acting was better. There are many parts where you can see what they were aiming for and it would be great if they actually hit those signs, but they don't. A confusing and incredible story. Even a bad DVD transfer. It doesn't take me long to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to close. It was too boring. I can make slow movies. But make them attractive in some aspect. Visually, story-wise, acting, etc. This was missing in all departments so it never contributed to a compelling experience. Perhaps the director's next attempt will be better.
