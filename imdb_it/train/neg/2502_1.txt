Yet another Die Hard straight to the video to screw with the bad guys of cardboard ?? How many more of these terribly evil (and badly) gods made out of the most popular action films of the late 1980s and early 1990s are still lurking? For the record (not that you really care) this is yet another rip-off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a complete series of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> the non-descriptive villains are the usual selection of cardboard rifles cut off from the hooligans who are sent by various means while the film progresses, the hero of course is a former policeman or something that has family problems and of attitude and, of course, brings to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a small piece of eye-pleasers and his annoying son. <br /> <br /> Is the alleged luxury cruise ship that runs between Florida and Mexico carefully described as a cross between a ship and a ferry? Does this go some way to explaining why it seems that they are launching themselves around on a rusty ferry with crossed canals? in New Zealand! The acting is wooden like the deck, the painful script, the boundaries a predictable, the bad guys absolutely inept and the plot has holes in which you can navigate through a boat. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a never ending tide of this kind of rip-offs directly to the video trash that pollute the nightly television slots and the DVD supermarket coffers everywhere (even though this film is so ugly that it has yet seen a version of DVD but gave it time!) Is there any chance of something at least half decently made, semi credible and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I didn't think ?? ..
