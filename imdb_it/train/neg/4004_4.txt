As a big fan or the Cracker series, I waited 7 years for the next addition. This episode, I fear, is not up to the legend. <br /> <br /> Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters' marriage and is involved in a murder investigation, a soldier, tormented by the flashbacks of his duty tour in Northern Ireland makes homicidal revelry. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like about this episode is the extremely convenient way in which everything was created and how the killer is brought from the killer. It's all fattened up. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good flashback scenes from Northern Ireland that turned out great.
