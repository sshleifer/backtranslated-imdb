Well, what can you say about an adaptation of Barbara Cartland? <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) but they are clearly filling up with money. <br /> <br /> Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics: Anthony with Hugh Grant (who seems appropriately embarrassed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> If you really want to see a "Watchable" adaptation of Cartland, Bonham Carter's is the one to follow ("A Hazard of Hearts" - what a title !!). Gilbert is the weak link in this, but Bonham Carter is appropriately beautiful and, of course, he can really act, and the rest of the cast interprets him to the hilt with tongues firmly in his cheek (Edward Fox and Diana Rigg)
