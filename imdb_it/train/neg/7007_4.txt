This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values ​​are OK, decent photography, discreet direction and all the rest. Mark Hamill was terrible. I never cared much about him, and this film validates this perception. No wonder he has never had any kind of career other than his "Star Wars" movies. I will simply say "Buh-bye, Mark" as he sinks into the well-deserved darkness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts has completely stolen the show. He showed fascination, beauty and acting lines in a single performance. I remember seeing her recently in "Texasville" and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting to see her from ten years ago. However, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, run away from this movie screaming in the hills.
