Although this film certainly has the stench of a bad movie, it is surprisingly watchable on several levels. First of all, for fans of old movies, it's interesting to see the main role played by Dean Jagger (no relationship with Mick). While Jagger later played a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even winning the Oscar in this category for 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), here his performance is truly unique since he actually has a thick hair (not his 'I've never seen it this way before) and because it was by far the worst actor in the film. This film shows that if an actor cannot play in his previous films, it does not mean that in the end you do not learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 50s. <br /> <br /> A second reason to watch the film is the cutting caesura. all. Writing is bad, acting is bad and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and an unnamed Cambodian are making their way through the water, it is obvious that they are actually walking on the spot and the background is poorly projected behind them. Moreover, once they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Horrid continuity and carefree stupid dialogue abound throughout the film - to the point that it is difficult to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to act in the film - since both have starred in many horror films of the zodiac. In many ways, this would be a perfect example for a film lesson on how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> So while giving him a 3 is probably a little too generous, it's fun to laugh at and short so it's worth taking a look at the bad movie fans.
