It's sad when you can see what a movie was trying to do, and it's pretty obvious that it was very far from the brand. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would have graduated has an idea. He wants total control. Thus he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece alone. Usually, his concept is well beyond his budget. He usually writes an exaggerated script full of every tag line he manages to invent. Usually, he is more interested in the grandeur of the story than in the sharpness of working with the actors on the individual scenes. Usually, it ends with a film that is weak in its attempt to create miracles on a limited budget. Usually, it ends with a series of meetings (we can't do justice by calling them scenes) that seem to be written by a twelve year old. And it usually ends with badly interpreted scenes that fail to catch the viewer. When you look at the judges from this perspective you can immediately say that it's just the usual rate.
