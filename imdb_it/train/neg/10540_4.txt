Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who owns the "First Power": even after being caught by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his body to body spirit and continues to kill at will. With the help of the sensual aspect, Tess Seaton (Melanie G.'s half-sister Tracy Griffith) tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept probably had some possibilities, I think, but in the end "The First Power" suffers from routine scripts and film production. This is nothing we haven't seen before, sometimes done better. There is nothing in this film to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More precisely, it is not very exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is a tough sale as a hard and cynical script stereotype, and Griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard; the best member of the cast is probably the distinctive feature of Kober, who does his best to be extremely terrifying. <br /> <br /> The climax is rather silly and the ending very weak. <br /> <br /> It is not even acceptable to evaluate how an average film of its kind, so: <br /> <br /> 4/10
