I only saw Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and I don't remember much, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for photos because she made people happy. <br /> <br /> He didn't really think that what he was doing was wrong, even when he left the company and found his religion again. <br /> <br /> The photos he took were certainly domesticated by today's standards, and it's fun to see men with cameras getting excited, and politicians pontificating about the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a fantastic part here. Mary Harron (American Psycho) has written and directed an extraordinary biographical film of the most famous pinup girl ever.
