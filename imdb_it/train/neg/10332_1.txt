Terrible, just awful. Show my theory on "stellar power". This should be a great TV because the guy who directed (battlestar) Titanic is the same guy who directed this schleckk ​​shlop schtockk on a girl. B O R I N G. <br /> <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting to do, such as watching TV without images and without audio. 1/10 (I rated it so high b / c there are no negative scores in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory about "star power": more "star power" used in a show, the weaker the show. (It is called indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" for better quality, etc. Another way to see it is: "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
