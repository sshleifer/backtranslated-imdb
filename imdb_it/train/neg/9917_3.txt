When Stanwyck's husband is murdered on the eve of their marriage, he retires to a mountain cabin, where he slips off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a decidedly unilateral marriage, spent on a large Chicago estate (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to rob Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing resolution. <br /> <br /> This film has an exceptional cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is tortuous and seems useless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie but in the end I was disappointed. It's still worth watching for the cast, and it's good for everyone who loves movies from the 1930s.
