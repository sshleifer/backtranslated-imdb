The film seemed to appeal because of the new type of Pok√©mon Celebi. But the plot was off course and had no interest like the other films. It was a waste of money and time. The same banal humor and bad villains. The film was useless to do if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The film should not be associated with animations such as Dragonballz, Digimon or Yu-Gi-Oh. The design and settings are not up to the standards of the original souls. It is also a pity to talk about this film. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the result of the movie and leave Pokemon alone. Digimon is more than an anime and doesn't fall anywhere near Pokemon. His second film will be released at the end of 2002.
