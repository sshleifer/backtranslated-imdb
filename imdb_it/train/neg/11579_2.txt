I must admit that I don't remember much about the characters or the story, although I'm not sure there was one, I was so annoyed by this movie that I had a little difficulty concentrating on this. How can you name a movie "Keys to Tulsa" and then film it in Texas? The flat desert around Arlington (I think it was the location) in no way resembles the green hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Obviously no one in the film has NEVER BEEN Tulsa otherwise they would have realized how nothing in the film resembled him. Had someone not seen at least Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds picky but I can't help it. I saw this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not revive this tortuous and mean story of self-involved people who ARE NOT IN TULSA !! I'm sorry, it can't be more expensive to film in Oklahoma. What if "To Live and Die in LA" had been shot in Toronto? Would this suck? Well, so does this.
