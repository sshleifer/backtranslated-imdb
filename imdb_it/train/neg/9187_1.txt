I've seen some pretty poor movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie. The production crew turned into zombies when they had the idea of ​​making it, because surely you must be brain dead to find pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of most genres and I enjoy "shooting" the games, but combining the silly scenes in the game made this ridiculous and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> As many have already said, there was almost no script and the acting was weak. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who considers this film to be above 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, or have a very deformed entertainment concept. <Br /> <br /> I must say that I was more annoyed with the video library, which gave me a thumbs up, which led me to rent it. Thank God I had a second movie to watch to restore some of my confidence in the movies. <br /> <br /> The comic book guy would be right if he said "The worst movie ever"!
