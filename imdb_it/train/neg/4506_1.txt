American filmmakers have decided to make a film that they think is Japanese. The characters are all badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and certainly does not represent Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Anyone who has read the book understands that the writers have not added any extra value to differentiate the film from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot with some waste. Rob Marshall is using two well-known Chinese actors for his two main characters who first joined the squatting tiger's hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw a Chinese film and these represent Japanese culture. Seeing those two actors again makes the films even more ridiculous. The last scene of Quentine Tarantino in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese than that of this film.
