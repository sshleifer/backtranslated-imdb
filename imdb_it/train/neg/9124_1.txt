This may not be the worst movie Peter Sellers has ever done (I think Laurel goes to "The Prisoner of Zenda") but it's definitely the most depressing. Sellers, particularly Nayland Smith's make-up, appear to have just undergone chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, it looks much better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those eerily disturbing scenes in which it is thrown by electric currents) about to collapse under the weight of all that trick. Even the support players seem tired and run down, and the presence of Sid Caeser is offensive even without his constant references to "Chinks!" (A bright spot: this would be one of the last times in which an important film portrays Asians in such an insulting way ... or, moreover, acts in a non-Asian like one!). The film looks surprisingly cheap, with a threatening photograph and lifeless set - even the number of Elvis with a bang at the end seems to be cut. Only the beautiful Helen Mirren and the tall, thin and nervous boy who wets his pants add sparks of life to this sad story. All in all, this film offers a disturbing premonition of the death of a great smoker and an even stranger record of his death.
