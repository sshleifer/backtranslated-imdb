I saw this movie in my English course this afternoon and I was surprised how bad this version was. Don't get me wrong, George C. Scott was as fantastic as Scrooge, but the rest of the cast doesn't hurt much. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated joke: "Merry Christmas to all!" At other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a story by Charles Dickens about a rich boy who does not believe that Christmas is nothing but a madness. After 30 minutes, the rich boy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after all. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how this film, with such a bad script must have been written in five minutes, can be so well evaluated. Instead of this piece of junk, I recommend the Bill Murray Scrooged comedy. At least, it was fun ...
