Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who is hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and gets another body. Lance takes the body of Charles Wellington, a white boy. So Lance does some things in Charles's body. The film has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better things than that. Only the whole movie will make you laugh 4 times. And it's not really fun to laugh. Laugh at yourself and you could giggle, but surely you won't roll on the ground laughing.
