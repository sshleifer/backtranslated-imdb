I don't know what it is with these Brady guys. First, Barry Williams publicly boasts of having sex with his sister TV, Maureen McCormick, and then going out with his mom, Florence Hederson. So, Susan (Cindy) Olsen makes music for a lot of porn movies. Then Mike (Bobby) Lookinland gets into trouble for drunk driving. Finally, Maureen (Marcia) McCormick and Eve (Jan) Plum may have had some homosexual flirtation on the side. Now, Christopher (Peter) Knight is chased by a beautiful young model in his early 20's during his "The Surreal Life" period, which was fun to watch at first, and now they are married and in a very volatile relationship and hostile. The last episode, in which he posed for a group of nude photographs with another naked girl for an album to give to Christopher for his birthday, was not a good move on his part. And he faced it in a very mature way, only picking up and leaving to clear his head. I think he always bowed to her every need and now he is finally taking a position. And I hate to say it, but I think you abuse it, in words. The way she was torturing him for an engagement ring and the way she redeemed him for every little thing. She also speaks openly about having relationships with other women and it is obvious that she still sleeps with him on women and men, which is not something that a self-respecting human being should do when he is already married to someone. If this were a man who talks to his wife like that, and going out every night to party and have sex with other people, everyone would line up behind his wife to leave him. Why should it be different? What started as a small crush on another reality show has blossomed into a huge disaster. Adrianne, as beautiful as she is, is like another Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, who clearly needs some therapy because she cries like a child for so many silly things. I'm sorry for her, but Chris needs to get rid of her, because he's a good man who can't afford to be humiliated in this way.
