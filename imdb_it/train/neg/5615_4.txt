I only watched the DVD 1. The correct program can have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise they are snotty putdown of religious people. It is as if the director Brian Flemming had only recently discovered atheism and sarcasm, and felt with these instruments that he could easily hit his opposition. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Flemming wanders extensively in his personal problems, and takes over the film. He never returns to the subject. <br /> <br /> Religious people are inclined to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in an abusive education. The arguments of these victimized people seem irrational and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people will want more data. We don't need to be told that religious people are crazy, any more than American Jews need to be told how annoying Christmas music comes in mid-December. <br /> <br /> In the best scene, the superintendent of Fleming's Christian school of childhood deals rather sharply with the director about his motives. It looks like the most honest part of the film, and it was too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming were a little more self-conscious, he could have a good story in him about his (past and current) relationship with Christianity and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth. And perhaps he could give his material "Christ never walked on earth" to a more serious documentarian. I'm not studying Saul / Paul's writings to find out how everything is watertight, but a quick Wikipedia search suggests that most of these topics are discredited. <br /> <br /> The bonus interviews are pretty good, even if they don't really support Fleming's argument. Sam Harris is a good spokesperson for the anti-religious POV and does not light up those other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easily Google) interviews on Salon.com, Amazon.com and Samharris.org.
