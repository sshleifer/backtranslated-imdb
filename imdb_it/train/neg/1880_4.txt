Despite being a big fan of the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it wasn't until about 6 years ago that I saw "Follow the Fleet" for the first time. I knew all the songs on an old Astaire / Rogers album (yes, vinyl) but I didn't know anything about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are catchy and the character of Ginger Rogers is sweet and fun, you just can't like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to remedy his longtime partner, he continually sabotages his career. His character does not have the usual humor and elan of Astaire's characters from the other films. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the songs and a great solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.
