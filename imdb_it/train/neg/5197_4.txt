Weaker entry into the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usual funny jokes and antics, but not much plot. Barrymore gets something to do as an inspector, exchanging disguises to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenny in a wild goose hunt (mostly in a circle, maybe the budget was narrower than usual) to save poor Phyllis, who is being held from people I want to lure Drummond to his fate. For those who keep the score, in this, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about the lack of a baby's baptism. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed as a fisherman to blend into The Angler's Rest, but little of this rises above a fool.
