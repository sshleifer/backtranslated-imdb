This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot didn't make much sense and the acting was horrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can't imagine why she decided to make this film. His character, Piper, is drunk from most of the movie, except for the opening scene. On the plus side, there were several points in the film where the acting was so bad, I actually laughed out loud. But despite this, I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's only 80 minutes, but it's 80 minutes of your life that you've completely wasted.
