Silent Night, Deadly Night 5 is the last of the series, and as part 4, it is not related to the first three except for the title and the fact that it is a Christmas-themed horror movie. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the unaware, there are some obvious things that happen here ... Mickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and the name of his terrifying son is Pino. Ring a bell, anyone? Now, a child named Derek heard a knock on the door one evening, and opened it to find a gift on the threshold for him. Although he said "don't open until Christmas", he starts to open it anyway, but is stopped by his father, who scolds him and sends him to bed, and opens the gift himself. Inside there is a small red ball that sticks out Santa's arms and head and proceeds to kill dad. Oops, maybe he should have left it pretty well alone. Obviously Derek is then traumatized by the accident since he watched him from the stairs, but he doesn't become a Santa Claus killer, he stops talking. <br /> <br /> There is a mysterious stranger who wanders around, those who seem very interested in the toys Joe Petto does. We even see him buying a pile when Derek's mom takes him to the store to find a present for him to take him out of his trauma. And what exactly is this guy doing? Well, we're not sure, but it looks like he's taking these toys aside to see what makes them beat. He makes his landlord evict him by promising to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a "Larry the Larvae" toy for his child, but of course "Larry" is not a good toy and leaves the box in the car things are not nice, of course. <br /> <br /> However, in the end what is happening with Joe Petto and Pino is obviously revealed, and as with the old story, Pino is not a "real boy". Pino is probably even more agitated and bad because he suffers from "Kenitalia" (a smooth plastic horse) so that he can explain his bad habits. And the identity of the lurking stranger is also revealed, and there is even a kind of happy ending. Whee. <br /> <br /> A step forward from part 4, but not much of one. Once again, Brian Yuzna is involved, and Screaming Mad George, so some decent special effects, but not enough to make it fantastic. Even some leftovers from part 4 are lurking, like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter, but this makes no difference. Anyway, now I've seen the whole series out of my system. Now if I could get some out of my brain. 4 out of 5.
