My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention the office shared with him. When it was announced that it was BTK, she was shocked. The whole day she was the only one to tell stories about how she would never see him as the Wichita Killer. I have heard it repeated again and again. I informed her about many things and went to all the interviews she was asked to go. I read the whole book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another movie on the BTK TV not long ago, and I thought it would be better to paint the Dennis murders, maybe even have some clever touches for his reasons. <br /> <br /> I will be very sincere with the flaws of this film. This is based on my mother's portrait of him, all my readings about him, and the videos I saw about him talking. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera angles were horrible. It looked like it had been shot on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to look at it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a "follow the rules book" guy. He wasn't as cute as the movie made him look, he was very polite and brusque, business like. The same goes for his killings, as far as we know. If you've seen his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And what about the obsession with the slaughterhouse? No. I've never read or Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or insects squealing. In fact, he practiced on dogs and cats for choking methods. Yet throughout the film, he was putting the animals in the faces of his victims and acting as if he were interested in their well-being. Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew, he confessed this, but in the film, during his first killing, he tells the lady who knows her too. I really don't even want to get into this movie, and I'm already shouting. This is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in BTK's real affairs. This is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want a half-porno badly shot with slaughter scenes served to the side, then this is your kind of movie.
