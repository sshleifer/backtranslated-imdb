This comedy isn't really fun. It's a love story that plays so much on stereotypes that it has no impact. It is a film of capers so derived - yes, even in those days - it doesn't have a click. <br /> <br /> The cast is adequate. More than that it's hard to say. However, what is nice is that the players are not familiar. At MGM, this would have played Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman who had no time for anything other than working could have been any number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known film is populated by mostly unknown artists today. And production values ​​are not terrible. Yet it does not make a real impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic knockoff. And who wants it?
