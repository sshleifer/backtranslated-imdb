I just saw this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend wanted to see him only thanks to Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel wasted time and money and I told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a movie just because there's a certain actor / actress. I hope you learned your lesson because I had trouble keeping it in place. For my part, since I have already paid, I wanted to see at least the end, only in the hope that something good would come, but I did not hold my breath, and fortunately, because I would have been a victim of the film the same. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white film, it is black and black. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sexual offenders are portrayed as irreducible and intransigent criminals and the bad ones between them were really very bad. Let's talk about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> The acting of Richard Gere was good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace it was corny at best. Completely unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it an economic, dramatic and sensational twist that is unreal. They only use sexual offenders as an excuse to indulge in expensive violent acts of murder, beatings, rape and torture - something that seems almost free. They even have a wolf that attacks people in the movie - how low you can get. <br /> <br /> I collect that the film will not be released in the United States and will go directly to DVD. He had to be housed in other countries too, but because he is Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even worth a movie from the B series.
