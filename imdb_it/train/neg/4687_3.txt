SPOILERS (EVEN NO ONE WHO WAS NOT REVEALED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE FILM) <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is actually pretty good at this as the loser Sy, friendly, lonely, emotionally lost. He makes a psychopath very human, even understanding, and really disappears into the character - no small business for such a recognizable artist. <br /> <br /> Too bad the rest of the film is such a waste. Support performances (and performers) would not appear out of place in soft-core porn (it doesn't help that every character except Sy is made of 100% cardboard). Sometimes it seems that the director is trying to frustrate the suspense: we know from the first moments a) that Sy is a complete job, b) that he survives, and c) that he is caught by the police in order. So all we have left to think about are how and why, and the answers given aren't all that interesting. <br /> <br /> The plot is tiring and artificial, and presents some meaningless moments (for example, the husband scolds his wife for her expensive tastes, even if it seems that she spends all her free time in the discount store hypermarket). At about two thirds of the distance, Sy does something so hopelessly stupid that it makes him think how much he really cares about his magnificent revenge project. And the final clich√© explanation of his psychosis, right outside of "Peeping Tom", is a terrible script. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is of the worst kind ever. It's not overwritten, or uncomfortable, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that can be considered fun, even for lovers of bad movies. Instead, each line is purely, horribly functional - it is as if the director delivered a story to a journalist and said: "Hey, I need a script about this - in an hour". It made me want to scream, honestly. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be a throwback to the eighties and nineties suburban thrillers (`The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, 'for example) and although it is certainly unpleasant, it is never really scary . Sy's fetishism makes you feel uncomfortable at times, but it's not enough by itself to make the movie work. In the end, the lack of mastery by all those involved, with the exception of Robin Williams, sinks this. 3 out of 10.
