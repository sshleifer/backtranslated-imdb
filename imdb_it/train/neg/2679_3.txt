(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term freely) I've been trying to see for over a year. I have finally come to the end and now I wish I had not made the repeated effort. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to save two hours of your life, I will tell you that it is he who draws a boy who has the ability to project a long blade from his arm back home to see his mother. Things get ugly after being beaten by an old girl's mafia boyfriend. He takes revenge on the boy when he takes the girl home. The mafia guys send his men to take revenge while the cops start looking for him as well. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. no explanation is really given for nothing (like why they block their girlfriend in an asylum) and the action, for the most part, is off screen. The film essentially consists of a guy who looks like an intense-looking Adrian Brody who says nothing, killing people (off-screen - most of the actions take place on the screen). It looks good, it's well acted and if there had been some form of reason for what was happening it could have been a good movie. In hell, I would have liked to have a sense of real character development or story (all we know is that the boy was chosen as a child). The film plays the best part of two hours and it seems to be his six. If they weren't going to tell us something they could at least take the pace, so it looked like they were moving too fast. No, instead, we take the hero on a boat. The hero in a bus, the hero who walks, the hero who seems disturbed. With his girlfriend. It really bothered me because I think this might have been a good movie if they just did something or someone actually said something meaningful besides giving instructions to "get this guy". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 Its about four hours (all my attempts to see it) will never come back. Only for those who want to watch a meditative Russian action movie with very little action
