I'm entertaining myself easily. I liked "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their numerous sequels, even when most people found them unbearable. I even managed to enjoy most of Pauly Shore's movies. There is only one film I saw that I can honestly say was bad ... and so it was. It's been a while since I saw it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a stupid movie, why did I see it?" It's honestly the only movie I can't recommend.
