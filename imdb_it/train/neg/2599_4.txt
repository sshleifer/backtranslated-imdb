I got a very cheap DVD and I'm a total Drewbie, and this is probably the only constellation that this movie could be of interest to anyone. <br /> <br /> An Early Drew movie, it looks great, and gets a lot of very nice scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, a number of sexy outfits etc. He never shows the friendly charm we know from his most recent films. <br /> <br /> the film itself is rather medium or sub-medium, and seems much more suitable for TV than for cinema. There is no real horror or accumulated tension and the dialogs are often poor. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don't understand it. But maybe there's nothing to understand anyway. But at least you don't get the end you'd expect, and it comes much sooner than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> In general, I think this film is exclusively for Drewbies.
