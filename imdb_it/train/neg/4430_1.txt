Thanks to a boring and dimensionless script by Neil Simon, and to the unpleasant direction of Robert Moore, Chapter Two becomes a squalid showcase for Marsha Mason who received the third of the four Oscars for Chapter Two giving the same performance here that he gave in Cinnderella Liberty (73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. The second chapter is the third and final feature film for which Moore had previously directed The Cheap Detective (78) by Neil Simon and Murder By Death (76). Caan is mixed, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is overly analytical and there are practically no details. The first half is a less than engaging relationship, intertwined with a tender love story between a battered Caan and a lousy Mason, and the sad second part makes you want the first time. The locations of New York as well as Joe Bologna, and Valerie Harper, painfully thin, are irrelevant, but at least provide a pleasant distraction. And last and least important, there is a horrible song played during the end credits.
