I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All small children want to go into space, right? Well, after seeing it, I was so scared to death that I would "accidentally" be thrown into space by some psychotic robot with a single mind. I had no idea it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I guess it was my version of when people were crazy about the "War of the Worlds" radio show. So, recently, I took this film to watch, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and I was laughing even more at acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, he moves in slow motion, haven't you ever noticed? I don't think being in space makes you talk slowly or think it's slow. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is knocked out of the oxygen tank and starts floating backwards when the security doors close. Little Max is trying to drag her. Suddenly, we get a major close to Max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) "Whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
