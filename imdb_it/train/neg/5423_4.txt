I've used IMDb for a few years, but I've never written reviews before. However, this film disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that I could no longer keep quiet. <br /> <br /> The noise is the story of a New Yorker (Tim Robbins) who is so upset by noise pollution that he takes on an alter ego like a vigilante, "The Rectifier", and vandalizes all the cars he finds with a car alarm. <br /> <br /> I take the name of the film is rather improper. Although there are one or two examples of other sources of noise that are addressed or mentioned, the only real focus of our protagonist is car alarms. Car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. There really is no other goal. When the film tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of alarms, it seems to have been simply thrown to give credit to the actions of the character of Robbins. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are all bothered by the noise. Nobody likes the sound of car alarms. Of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat against a screaming vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and practically only that, to sell this movie. I say "practically" because there is also a blatantly invented sexual relationship (including an absolutely useless trio) that is obviously thrown for those movie goers who need things like that to enjoy a movie. Honestly, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> The character of Robbin, very early in the film, becomes completely unreliable. It seems less that he decides not to bear the noise anymore, and more than focusing so much on the noise he started to lose his sanity. The first half of the film is essentially the story of how he turns from an angry, car-filled guy in this little hero, The Rectifier. However ... the transformation does not take place. It has just been renamed. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a while. An annoying generalized social comment arrives from time to time to add to the pretentiousness of the film, and the smirk that never leaves Robbins completely doesn't even help them. <br /> <br /> In general, I think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much pushed into my throat, but in my opinion, it fails significantly. Only the opinion of a boy, cheers.
