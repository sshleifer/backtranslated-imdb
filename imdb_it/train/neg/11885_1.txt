I will dispute with the usual confrontations with a certain legendary director known for his neurotic New York character, because frankly, to make comparisons with the loser loser Josh Kornbluth, it is only an offense to any director of the genre. I will also avoid mentioning the `Office Space 'satire in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. Can I, however, compare it to awakening during your surgery? It's painful to watch and you wonder if surgeons really know what they're doing. Haiku Tunnel is the type of film you would like to have pulled the plug in the early stages of production. It was cruel to let him live and, as a result, the public around the world was forced to suffer. <br /> <br /> The premises of the film ?? if he really has one ?? it is not even worth discussing, but I will do it prudently. Josh Kornbluth, a temporary worker with serious commitment - phobia, is offered a permanent job. His main task is to send 17 high-priority letters to his boss. But ridiculously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! This is not a story ?? it is a passing thought at best, one that should have surpassed any self-respecting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> The main actor ?? if you can call it that ?? it is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with plump features, an enveloping indomitable receding hairline and a series of facial expressions ranging from cringe-making to simple disturbance. Where or where did the director find this schmuck? What are you saying ???? is he the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing in one's embarrassment over a script is one thing, but I suspect Mr. Kornbluth is not as convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is absolutely not a murder without purpose, but never before have I been so irritated by the presence on the screen of an actor! My frustration was further confused by his incessant monologues behind closed doors between the scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needed an ounce of intelligence to understand this madness, Kornbluth further insulted us by "explaining" the action (the first rule of cinema: "dramatizing exposure", showing, not saying). Who do you think it is? He has no charisma, no charm and, judging by his Hawaiian shirts, he has no sense of style. His casting agent should be the turning point in white! <br /> <br /> Support actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt, with one exception. Patricia Scanlon presents herself in a very funny way with Helen, the former secretary, who has gone mad from her old boss and makes unpleasant phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This made me laugh at myself, but the time soon passed and I went back to checking my watch for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled by thinking that this is an arthouse movie because of its pretentious title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and did not make any money at the box office ?????? there is a good reason for this! <br /> <br />
