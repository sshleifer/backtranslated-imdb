This is definitely one of the most bizarre films of the 70s out there, and it's more important to kick off a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also noteworthy for the little touches of madness throughout the film, especially when the dark and moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out, one of the songs is dedicated to a character , Travis Crabtree, who pays a little canoe for a while, then ... he leaves, never to see again). Although today is painfully dated, they are still a fun movie to show to children, and anyone who loves the Bigfoot tradition or the culture of the 70s is a blast. My favorite part: a boy gets so scared that he jumps headfirst through a door (!?) And the narrator explains that he fainted from the "shock". Uh, I'd say that smashing a door with your head is more likely because it's unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad American.
