The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable. The characters are credible and interesting. The cloning lab looks really high-tech. After that, everything collapses. The characters begin to behave in an idiotic way, and a new subplot is introduced from nothing on a fusion reactor (and this is presumably "present") that becomes critical, the only justification for the plot is that it is necessary to kill the dragon - only who doesn't do it t. The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a film that started so well started so well. <br /> <br /> All the characters except Dean Cain are played by the Russians. This results in some strange situations and details, such as the character played by Vessela Dimitrova who is called "Bailey Kent" despite her strong accent (and despite her, on one occasion, inexplicably passes to * Spanish *!). <br /> <Because of the good start, I considered the evaluation of this 5-piece movie, but in reality it was more disappointing, so I only gave 4.
