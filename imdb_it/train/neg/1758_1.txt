If you haven't seen it yet, I say just go ahead, take a walk in the park, don't waste time. Neither the scenario nor the acting are worth your money. * Spoiler * - I can't decide which is the worst: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very questionable, I hope he can improve it over time. The plot is simply amazing. Loose cannon American policeman who fights criminals in Europe alone ?? Infamous Slavic Mafiosi protected by only two large pieces ??? An emotional art teacher who leads a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police executive more stupid than a lot of hammers ??? Give me a break. There is only one positive aspect of this film, however: At least, production costs must be lower than those of "Ocean's 12", which were meaningless and over the top like this.
