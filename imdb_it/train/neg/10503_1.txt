I saw this movie yesterday .. I rented the DVD from Blockbuster .. In fact, I know one of the actresses in the film .. I will not say who ..! (It's kept hidden ...) But I have to admit it wasn't as good as I thought it would be .. Tom Savini? A chapel to this boy .. But it's a pity he hasn't been in the movie for a long time. What the film lacks is the idea, the script, the sound, etc. It might look like a good movie .. but it wasn't I'm so glad .. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm glad my sister paid Â£ 10 to rent 3 DVDs from Blockbuster .. I chose this .. and I stayed disappointed. Anyway, thumbs down for me ..! Not my cup of tea! 0 out of 10!
