Usually, I know after the first minute of a movie if I'll hate it or love it ... but now, I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> The start was great; the "this is based on a true story" and the blah blah blah thing was fun. Later, the cartoons and the description of the boys' life with the images made me think I had made the right choice. <br /> <br /> Then, seeing Toronto's exhilarating fake appearance was beautiful. Furthermore, the situation and appearance of the house seemed to confirm my first idea. <br /> <br /> It was perhaps the first 10 minutes of the film ... which later seemed like an eternity. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me that I don't understand Canadian Canadian humor (it's possible, English Canadians don't always understand Quebec's humor), but hey ... there was enough stuff in that for a short film, * nothing * more. Perhaps it could be a meaning for the title? However, almost everything was filling up, and very few things were even very fun for me. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "making of" was better than the film. At least you understand the motivation behind what made everything negative. The potential of the idea was great; that's why I rented the film, being interested in the "vanishing people" thing. But still, I didn't know that the whole universe would vanish, and with it also a point for the film. <br /> <br /> If you are Canadian English, it seems that you can appreciate the local humor, considering the surprising number of people who gave this film an 8. Otherwise, think twice before losing your precious time ...
