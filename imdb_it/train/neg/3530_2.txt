When Ritchie first entered the cinema scene, his films were received as amusing, witty, well-directed and original. If one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal disgust his last two releases have created one should consider - was Ritchie discovered? Is he really that talented? Do you really have any original original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all in a colossal and disorganized heap? After seeing Revolver could you be excused for thinking that everything had gone wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did you get all these mixed and twisted ideas? Revolver tries to be intelligent, philosophical and synthetic, tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a gigantic effort to fulfill all these many goals and invests great pieces of a script in existential reflections and numerous twists. However, in the end all that is needed is to build a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately hostile film for the public. His plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that, even if Ritchie at least tries to give his own turn, he should be punished by even trying to pass off as if it were his job. So ultimately the audience is a terrible script intertwined with many pretentious oneliner and clumsy setpieces. <br /> <br /> Revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland film that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces such as Fight Club, Soliti suspetti and Pulp Fiction. Toe up, but inevitably the shots shoot in abundance. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be trampled on, it's a really poor film masked by an aspiring masterpiece of an aspiring author. However, he falls to the ground on his far-fetched face and fails to achieve everything he wants to be and reach.
