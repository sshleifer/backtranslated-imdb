Dear dear dear dear dear ... me! I had the strength to see it through ... But why? <br /> <br /> The first two films where it is fun and somewhat good. But this is so serious that we had trouble seeing it all. This was a kind of Tremors for children. I can't believe this movie was made ... it seems that the props were taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they simply did everything they could with it. <br /> <br /> is the audience this movie? I can only think of 12-14 years. If you are over 14 you will have serious problems with this movie. It's not just slow, but it's so utterly boring. The characters are overcrowded (not just a little bit of both) and so stereotyped is fun for a while ... but not long enough not to make you want to throw tomatoes on the screen. You know everything that will happen too, because yes ... you have seen a BILLION of times before in any series of heroes on TV for children. I chose all the survivors and all the tremors of fodder when the characters were introduced. It's so bad..so wrong..so ... sucks. <br /> <br /> But OK, we laughed from time to time. Not just for the silly holes in the plot, but for some scenes where a replica or two is worth it ... or a scene that is, where two small tremors launch into one of the obvious tremors of the kids fodder ... It's really a great scene that made us do it over and over and laugh with all your heart. It still makes me smile when I think about it. But that happened once again in a sad way ... and that's when the "badass" shows up and rips off his wonderfully ... which is a comment "They rise from the ground like a DEMONIC TROUT!" At this point we almost cried with laughter. But after that ... nothing could exceed that .. (?) .. so it's pretty much downhill from there. <br /> <br /> So top here are demonic trout and overacting. If anyone ever told you that this is a good movie ... it's a "plant", a vegetable or someone very evil. This film must be the worst of the tremors by far. I can't wait to see Tremors 3, it will surely be a box office success compared to this ... this ... * goose bumps * no ... I'll leave it.
