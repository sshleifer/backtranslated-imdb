The longer this film went on - and it seemed that it continued to be boring forever - the more annoyed I became, frankly, what a waste of time passed through this total nonsense. How do people manage to make films like this, or even receive funding for such garbage? Don't be fooled by the relatively high rankings on IMDb as it shows that you can make fun of some people at any time. And in this picture the main players have an obsession with guns, so it's not hard to see how this movie will unfold. America can never understand that the rest of the world finds bizarre how society in the United States has such an obscene and fatal "gun culture". <br /> <br /> In any case: <br /> <br /> The leading actor portrays a loser who flees to a fantasy world of being a cowboy in an urban sprawl. He runs into a family with two spoiled snotty children, a girl and a boy; cared for by a strict single parent who can barely cope. The cowboy is seduced by the teenager or vice versa, and the impressionable boy is apparently taken by the madness of the loser. <br /> <br /> The cowboy spends all his time in a state of unreality and depression. A total loser who prefers to go to the beach to work for a living, and then steal with his family because he is too lazy to make money legally. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: <br /> <br /> Who wants to see or a sad loser failed in a fantasy world that sustains a death wish, or even see a poor family that is actually not much better white garbage?! <br /> <br /> This movie is useless drivel. <br /> <br /> It only saves you from getting the lowest score possible from a music that can listen to half: <br /> <br /> 2/10.
