Cassidy (Kacia Brady) puts a gun in her mouth and blows the back of her head on her boyfriend Neal (Jason Dibler). Cassidy was the lead singer of a "demon and death" rock band that couldn't shake the sad feelings of her boyfriend's neglect of her (you know, I can find other reasonable ways to solve this as well as put a bullet in my head). She returns, however, possessing the soul of Dora (Jill Small), her friend who will replace her with the voice so that the group can finish the album interrupted by the premature death of Cassidy. But, Cassidy has made a deal with the dark one and the souls have to be collected ... it is consumed by this anger towards mainly Neal, but all the band members or anyone in the music studio become dead when they fall prey to whom they believe it is a rather upset Dora ... it is not Cassidy who returns to be repaid. <br /> <br /> The petty and low-budget horror film seems cheap, has an inexpensive cast that should make plans in another line of work and boast cheap kill scenes that are NOT little effective.
