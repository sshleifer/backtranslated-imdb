It is hard to believe that this is the sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring and goes nowhere. Where did the spirit go? I'm baffled. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of his dialogues and scenes are still vivid in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) - the fault is entirely linked to the plot, to the dialogue and even to some of the shooting (the low budget is not an excuse). A big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry I couldn't pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed ... if you liked this, you might not have so much fun with Henry Fool ... the two films have absolutely nothing to do with the other ... there is no continuity in the personality of the characters ... it's all a deception to entice Henry Fool fans to watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> I'm shutting down this now - Henry in a sort of prison with a Taliban?!?!
