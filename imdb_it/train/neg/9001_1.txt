When I watch a movie, I am aware that it is "just a movie", but I like to allow myself to become as much as possible, given the circumstances. I think this is what makes us cry, scream, laugh or react emotionally as members of the audience, even if, after all, we know it's "just a movie". What I don't want is for the film to remind me that it's just a movie, so I can't slip into that excitement regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this film has chosen to use shots with multiple angles on the screen frequently. Maybe it's just me, but I find that he is terribly distracted and very irritating. They could also run a continuous banner at the bottom of the screen reading: "Warning: this is just a movie. Don't allow yourself to become too interested or absorbed." , but never during a movie I want to enjoy.
