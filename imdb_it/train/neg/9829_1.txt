The premise sucked me in, but it was clear for about 30 seconds that it was David Lynch or something terribly terrible. Interesting to look at just to scroll through the list of fundamentalist laundry. I can be a sucker for a touching spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual about it. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend to have an iq of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any kind of self-examination or we'll trigger the second coming. It's the kind of attitude that makes jumbo jets fly in 110-story buildings (around the corner from the former WTC site). I like to think that God is a little bigger than that.
