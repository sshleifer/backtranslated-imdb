Holy God going mad almighty. This movie was so ugly, I thought I was drugged. In a bad way ... Acting the character is the poorest thing I've seen in a while. This film was more like Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO (it's a real movie). Most of the film looked like it was made on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when I'm in a carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They are fleeing from alien monsters and are going at the same speed as a fast race. Then switch to a distant field with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be comparable to the 1992 Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, come on, really. It looked like a horrible episode of Hercules, only without Kevin Sorbo there to save the day. Worse. Movie. Never.
