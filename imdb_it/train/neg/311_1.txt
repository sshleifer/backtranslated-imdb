I just finished watching Going Overboard. I must say that we should send all copies of this film to Iraq and have them look. I also tried to show a blind woman and turned it off in 20 min. Has Adam Sandler failed to find a better project than this? As for writing, if this is what you want to call, the perpetrators should be forced to watch this movie endlessly in hell !! I think somewhere I read that the budget for this film was $ 10,000 and they were underneath. Did Wallmart make a good deal on this? Each store has a huge huge basket of this shit sitting on the sales floor. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster or swap it with a friend, but then they may no longer be your friends !!
