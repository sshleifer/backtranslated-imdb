Well, they say that nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but he is certainly in a sexual relationship with men. He is still exploring, trying to find "more data" so he can see what he wants from life and from men, even though it seems that at his age he should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with those who say that Young is too old for the role. If he is, we should all age so well.) For the most part this film has left me cold, even if it is not the worst of its kind you will ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut', at least something happens in this.
