This could be incredible, but this film grossed $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown in almost all cinemas and continues to run! Well, I have no idea why the distributors have set their sights on this particular "film", which has barely had a worldwide screening. It's a kind of enigma! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another film, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was also released only on DVD almost everywhere, had major screenings in Russia and grossed over $ 1m. In addition, both films have had a lot of promotion, such as banners throughout the city, TV commercials, etc. Speaking of movies, I'd say it's boring and absolutely boring. It could be better, really. Even if he has Jessica Simpson.
