I wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say this could be a good show ... This show is good only if you don't know which "talent" is ... I won't even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people) because that's not what worries me about the show .. What bothers me is that people look at this and think it's funny ... It makes me feel that our generation is becoming I'm stupid and I'm really scared that one day it will be run by people watching this garbage .. <br /> <br /> Basically the plot is simple. They are offensive, selfish and spoiled women (Sarah Silvermen) going through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> Here ... How has it not been done a million times ... In fact almost every joke has been done or is racist .. <br /> <br /> Sarah likes singing too..I like her voice..this is..the lyrics are not ... The lyrics are terrible..which she likes sing about a lot of things .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see hot women, put all the others down and build everything I feel disgusted while at the same time farting and saying bullshit on every race, then this show and for you ..
