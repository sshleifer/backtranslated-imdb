Well, I don't know where to start. Obviously this was a TV movie, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised by the general direction of the second hour, but anything before or after seemed to paint from the genre of numbers in the film. <br /> <br /> And talk about bad chemistry between the two love detectives. .. <br /> <br /> I'd go deeper, but this movie doesn't really deserve it. Grade: D + (IMDB classification 3/10)
