The photograph on the DVD is so obscure that I thought the screen was dead. I think I lost half of the movie. However, it was badly done and uninteresting. I did not find the story related to the title "The Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller, but I didn't let myself get involved enough to worry after the first few frames. I rented the film especially for Willem Dafoe and I was sad because he wasted his talent. I don't think Giada Colagrande has studied cinema doing enough time to develop an important film. He is attractive and could turn into an actor, but he has taken on too many tasks in this film. Although they are married in real life, they lack on-screen chemistry. Their relationships did not seem credible. I don't understand why the other characters were introduced into the plot.
