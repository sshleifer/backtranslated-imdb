someone needs to make a payment in the car ... this is really horrible ... makes Jean Claude's cyborg look like he's gone away with the wind ... this time I wish I could sue to come back ... for luck has produced severe sleepiness ... from which I fell asleep. how can actors of this caliber create this dog? I'd rather spend the time watching the algae grow on the side of a fish tank rather than sharing this completely horrible mix of different kinds. Now I use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table. $ 5.99 at walmart is too much to spend on this movie ... if you really have to have it, wait for them to throw them out after they've taken them to the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they wouldn't sell. <br /> <br /> please for the love of god let this movie die of darkness.
