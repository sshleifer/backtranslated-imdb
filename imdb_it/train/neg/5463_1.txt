I saw Arthur (TV series and books) years ago and I never really liked the show (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I'm ruining everything, but this is actually what I think Many people liked, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The characters of school children seemed to fight all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were nice to each other frequently, but gradually tired of the Arthur's plaintive attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (however the name was written), and DW was an ADHD (or ADD) - like Arthur's four-year-old sister he sometimes asked (which could be the why Arthur got annoyed by his habits, like his imaginary friend and his collection of stuffed animals, etc.), Arthur's friends behaved like teenagers instead of how they were in Arthur's books, and parents, well, a they didn't care much. <br /> <br /> The biggest cardboard animated is Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
