could you ask why? the characters growled, screamed and chewed the scenery without any perceptible reason except that someone wanted to make a film in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, is that right ?, is a role to forget in the role of policeman / foreign husband / cute-of-pretty-blonde father. the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away by adventure films over the past three years. Ellen Pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene in which it finds itself. Its true acting range is displayed when the blouse is removed while the films move from one scene to the next. unfortunately, directing rarely goes bad enough to be a field or a parody. it's all just clich√©, familiar in all respects. the director launched his daughter as a precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have allowed a client to ruin a career being in a film so lame, invented and uninteresting. the only robbery here is the theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time.
