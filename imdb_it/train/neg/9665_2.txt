Interesting? Almost. The "scientific proof" that the film provides for its point (which is basically that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost ridiculous (if we didn't know what happened at that time). <br /> <br /> Important? Nah. I can't imagine that the Germans (even in that horrible moment) would like or believe in this film. Compare it with the Triumf des Willens by Riefenstahl. Now that I was a movie, I was impressed. This is just stupid junk. <br /> <br /> The 'best' part is a scene from M (one of my favorites of all time) where (the Jew, as the announcer reminds us so eloquently) Lorre plays a child - Molester and murderer. In the eyes of these directors, only a depraved mind can do it. Uh Huh. I didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's simply STUPID. Also for its kind of Nazi propaganda. 2/10.
