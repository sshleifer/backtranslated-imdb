Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic written by halopes. <br /> <br /> For a short film, cinematography, costumes, sets, sound, editing and everything else is very, very good. At first this might seem surprising, but I was told that the technical crew that worked was professionals, so the quality is predictable. The problem, as usual, lies in the story itself. <br /> <br /> The fact is that it's not really a story. To tell a story (or in the case of cinema, SHOW a story) you need plot and conflict. You need things that happen to the protagonist: the events. These events happen because the protagonist wants something and, for some reason, he can't understand it. Tim Watcher has no problems or goals. It is a kind of supernatural entity that observes humanity. That's all. So what we have here is pure exposure. Instead of showing a story, we're simply learning things about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, considering the peculiar nature of Tim Watcher and the short duration of the film, it is difficult to give enough backstory about him so that the film uses Voice-Over Narration. In this case it is used in the worst possible sense, or to provide information that otherwise we would never have considered. In fact, if it were not for the VO, we would think that the character was just an old kooky who was turning to look at things. To make the VO worse, it also explains what's happening on the screen! The images shown to us are only decorations for the text we are listening to. <br /> <br /> I could say that this short film would be a good video for a band or something like that, but because the images don't give them I can't say it alone. What is left of course has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities (not incredible, but good) but fails to entertain, amuse, excite or, at least, show a story.
