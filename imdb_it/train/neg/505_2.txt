Wow, this sucks. I'm summarizing as quickly as possible. <br /> <br /> A count invites 4 naive whores to his castle. A lot of nothing happens for a long time. Soft and non-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls cut their heads off the screen. The end. <br /> <br /> The only things that go for this are decent decorations and costumes, an ugly dubbing that leads to involuntarily funny dialogues, and some brief strokes of nudity. And believe me, those things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of boredom of this movie. In fact, the best part is starting with the distributor who presents some goth-bitched girls covered in blood and showing their tits - and again - this is certainly not worth the admission price for this junk. As everyone else has noted, the film's title is completely meaningless, since there is absolutely nothing about bloodsuckers, nor ballets of any kind in the film. It could also have been called "The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk" and, at least, it would have had a better title that doesn't concern anything in the film. An accurate title would have been "90 minutes of torture", another enticing title that would have been at least truthful ... for the viewer. Honestly, the trailer on the disc shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" extremely freely ...) so I highly recommend watching it if you're still curious. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie incident, please follow my advice and leave this on the shelf. 2/10
