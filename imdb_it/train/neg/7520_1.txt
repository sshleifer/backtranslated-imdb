This film shows that you can't judge a movie by the fantastic artwork on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about a movie before buying it (or taking it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this film seems somehow promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old man on the street) brings to college a book full of witch spells that leaves their haunted house (where the film takes place). After that there's a bit of drinking, fighting and soft core porn. So the action of the film finally takes place after more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, unsuspected and resembles soft-core porn. This film is probably best seen with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of. And for those looking for the first time, it's really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
