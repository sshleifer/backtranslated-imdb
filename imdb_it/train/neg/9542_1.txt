I don't know what else to say about this horrible film that hasn't already been said. Honestly, I just have to be angry with myself. I should have known better when I saw the title of this movie that would have been a horrible piece of shit, but I love the War Games, so I indulged my whim. I will live to regret that decision for the rest of my life. From the beginning, when government people explained that their super computer could determine who was a terrorist just because of the way they played a video game, I knew I was around, even if the earth-that-good-writing -dimenticava. The list of plots, dialogues and very, very, very bad actions is so long that I would like to crash on IMDb if I tried to post it. To those people who said they saw worse films than this please tell me. I'm really curious to see something that could overcome this steaming pile of horse dung.
