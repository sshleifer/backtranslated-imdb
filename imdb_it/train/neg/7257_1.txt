I was expecting a French B-Movie musical. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, DeFunès were superstars of the low-budget French films of the time. And it's in color! But I have a hallucination in this incredible half hour of pure mediocrity. The musical numbers are horrible and the comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? What songs? This is just a succession of ugly numbers, one after the other. The only thing very rare about this thing is the nakedness of women. He wasn't familiar at the time. In fact, some numbers are there just to show us topless women. Adds to mediocrity! And try to find the young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, in part as a musician, in his first film. Good luck!
