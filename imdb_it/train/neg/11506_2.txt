This movie story is bad enough, which can happen in real life. I just can't understand when they show us this bad movie. I say it was bad because there is some reason. 1. If Madonna is rich and can do whatever she wants, then why she falls in love with that bad man. 2. How can the script be so weak? She was so rich, she can do whatever she wants, but don't dare divorce her husband which is very impossible. <br /> <br /> The words I LOVE YOU, means nothing in this film.
