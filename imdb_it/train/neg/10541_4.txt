I wrote down some notes here on THE FIRST POWER, Lou Lambada Diamond Phillips 1990 satanic yuppie hell-fest serial killer ... <br /> <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently indicted for beating his wife and can serve time in prison. I just hope he can find the clothing from the Armani prison to go in style: One of the guilty pleasures of this film is to see the police detective dressed in $ 4500 coats, a $ 7300 silk suit and see his $ 3,500 / month Los Angeles bachelor's loft with interior design by Mies Van Der Roeh. <br /> <br /> 2) The protagonist Tracey Phillips has a beautiful porcelain skin, flowing red hair that always seems in style even though mussed and fantastic breasts that are lit up in the second half of the film by a signed silk pullover that sadly he remains on his bust even when he was prepared to be sacrificed to Satan. At least in the 1970s our demonic killers stripped their victims before they got away with it, although there is something to be said for leaving a little to the imagination. In the last 10 minutes of the movie all I could think of was what her breast would probably be like. <br /> <br /> 3) Psychic Professionals living in Los Angeles can afford $ 4 million condominiums on Mullholland Drive overlooking Los Angeles with a perspective that would have led Brad Pitt to decide that he was roughing it. In fact, the condominium used in this film looks exactly the same as that of David Lynch, MULLHOLLAND DR., Who at least had the good sense to make a resident condominium a successful director. The only Professional Psychologists I've met outside of this film are currently serving prison sentences for online fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I have forgotten his name but the villain in this film is wonderful, and his "How are you", Buddy Boy? "the line could be the most neglected phrase of the film from" THANK YOU FOR IL VIAGGIO, SIGNORA !! "from CREEPSHOW 2. <br /> <br /> 5) Under the main metropolitan cities there are huge vats of boiling acid that will explode in huge fireballs if someone throws a Zippo lighter lit in them, which is why the main public water supply power stations all have no signs of smoke plastered everywhere, even if the idea of ​​smoking around water is dangerous is obviously absurd, and since Zippo lighters must be filled manually with a liquid lighter that it can escape and be absorbed by a piece of clothing, the idea of ​​carrying it in the pocket of your $ 7300 Gucci silk dress seems much more dangerous. <Br /> <br /> 6) The acrobatics in this films are nothing short of impressive, and one of them and fun to watch it you remain yourself that you're not seeing computer-aided special effects but real stuntpeople who risk their lives and limbs to contribute to a film that has received almost universal BOMB ratings from critics when it was released. <br /> <br /> 7) Film satanists always amaze me: here is a guy who drew on some Luciferian offer for power, and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or making sure that fashion models engage in free sex with him, instead he owns purse ladies and levitate them out of people's apartments. About this, here is an indestructible boy, able to fly and able to put his being inside other people's bodies - yet he obliges the star Lou Diamond Phillips to a normal fistfight in the conclusion of the film, but not has the sense to live in Arnold Schwartzeneggar or Apollo Creed to make sure he wins. <br /> <br /> And so on ... To be watched in the company of wise friends while they drink beer. You will have fun as long as you firmly refuse to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> 4/10
