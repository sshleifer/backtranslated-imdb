All the elements for a bad night at the cinema are in place: a dialogue full of biological technological jokes, chintzy skits, balsa-wood, a horrible Casio from the late 80s and a general look that suggests something about the Fi Channel programming program , circa 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" begins with many promises, the film unfolds in mild idiocy and MST3K style cheese like Clark Kent, the famous "Doctor" Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pushed to release information about his projects secrets. But when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he turns into a vaguely defined creature (which looks more like a resemblance to "Dr. Freudstein" than "House by the Cemetery"). The work on FX is good enough for such a low budget production (although I suspect most of it is overshadowed for a reason), but overall, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad aftertaste in your stomach, despite his hopes to influence us otherwise. I can't help but agree with a character's concluding remark: "(Was) A nightmare ... from the past!"
