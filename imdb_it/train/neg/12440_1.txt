This is the worst piece of brain junk, super cheap, super stupid, silly, worthless I've ever seen, an incredible junk of instant cult status among the bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, it looks like "Citizen Kane" compared to that. Special effects? ... again, "Piano 9" is "Star Wars". Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so he goes beyond evil, really. But if you're looking for that kind of incredible movie, it's for you! I'm a fan of American International for many glorious horror films, the saga of Price-Corman-Poe and some great blaxploitation stuff, but with "Star Creatures" they descend to level Z. Of course, my 1 out of 10 works in reverse sense if you like watching bad movies for fun (the guy who plays an Indian chief is great) so have fun and have fun ... if you can.
