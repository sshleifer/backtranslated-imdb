Although I have yet to review the film in about two years, I remember exactly what made my opinion as low as it did. Having loved the original Little Mermaid, and being obsessed with child sirens, I decided I would have time to sit down and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you don't have the director and the actors at hand ... you're just trying to get yourself punched. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with slightly older Ariel and her daughter, Melodia. My first big problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is great in the numbers of singing and dancing, but in reality, this is what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected and a true gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did. NOT. SING. <br /> <br /> And then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget the shivers that went down our thorns every time Ursula threw herself on the screen, terrorizing both Ariel and the public all over the world? Unfortunately, that gene was not passed on to his seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing has ever been, MAI said of Morgana in the first film; she comes out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, how nice. The younger sister is blunt and instead of chasing the trident, she decides to kidnap a month-old child. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Besides being a flat character with no sense of originality in her, Morgana was simply very unorthodox. The same floor as his sister, the same henchmen (who, by the way, didn't scare anyone. I had a three-year-old boy on my lap when I watched this movie, and she laughed hysterically.) He wasn't going to be in there; I wish I had seen Mom be the villain. I'm sure he would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish over there. <br /> <br /> King Triton didn't have the respect he had earned me in the first movie and didn't even start on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first film, and in the second is almost as if he had lost the will to put fear in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief that made everyone laugh with his "dingle-hopper" (yes, I admit, from time to time I called my fork a dingle-hopper). In this film, Scuttle is almost forgotten. A supporting character even in the first, at least added something to the film. It was rich in flavor that others did not have, and in the sequel, they had stripped it completely. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worried than before. Disney, don't do it. Don't even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish, which becomes dad and has a multitude of very annoying children. He is fat, and he is insipid, and he seems to be about to escape at any moment. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguin were not necessary, and after a while you begin to resent yourself all. Especially Melody, who has no depth for her. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I'm getting out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you didn't love your originals so much.
