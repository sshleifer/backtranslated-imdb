Well, so I was dying to see this movie. I talked about "who is who" in the land of horror that is in the movie ... well, my friend rented it, brought it here and we started watching it. It should be a comedy .... I didn't smile once, up to the 40 minute mark. <br /> <br /> Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there are films out there that cost CLEARLY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they are incredible (for me anyway). Also, while watching this movie, I couldn't help but realize the similarities (for example, STEALING) with a low budget independent film entitled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review about it (DESTROYS this BTW movie) > <br /> This movie ... really had potential. He had the "power of stars", a stolen plot (he lets film the backstage of the making of a movie ... IE ... "APOCALYPSE DI ATTRICE" .... seriously, this makes me more and more angry I think of , ... could really have been fun. VERY MUCH the bars fall flat. Acting is good for what it is. But it was dragged, it wasn't fun, and the plot was completely stolen. <br /> <br /> I gave it a two, because it wasn't SOOO VERY GOOD, but that's the ONLY reason.
