I ordered the film from Korea because I was an extra in it and I was interested to see how it turned out. <br /> <br /> After seeing it I can say I was ashamed to have been a part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who played a role in making this mockery of the British "comedy". <br /> <br /> From start to finish the film is predictable, boring, boring, monotonous and worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the disapproving screen. Until you actually see the movie, it's hard to imagine how romantic and comedy a romantic comedy can be. <br /> <br /> It's not just a bad story, but a bad film. In a scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the AA. when to clean. I will insert the details of this in the 'Goofs' section. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, it filled me with emotions (disappointment, anger, embarrassment ??)
