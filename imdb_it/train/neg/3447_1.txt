This is easily one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. It's not scary or any of the other things suggested in the plot. This film is very slow and I was bored for most of the 98 minutes. While acting is mediocre at best, the biggest problem is the script, which is poorly written, slow and trudging without a real direction. Occasionally a disturbing mood is set only to be broken by some useless line or event. I'm not surprised that the whole cast was sick and vomiting between shots, they had to try to digest a terrible script. Being a big fan of good horror movies, I am always annoyed that something so bad is being done. Save yourself 98 minutes you will never come back.
