Channel navigation and detected on LOGO. It was one of those moments "I have to see this because it's so horribly bad", like Roadhouse without joy. The writing is atrocious; completely crazy and acting is a bad joke. <br /> <br /> There is a low budget and then there is the abyss which is the place where this epic should be tossed and never seen again. I mean, the main characters go to a ski house in a rented house and the house is, well, ordinary that is not a big problem, but they have chosen to show all the guests who flock there like the Sistine Chapel . I'm sorry, but looking at 6 fixed guys every boring 10 'x 10 room with a futon and gushing is lame. I guess they didn't learn anything from the Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see the scene in the hotel room check room) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy it so that everything goes routine. If it smells like ... and it seems ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. <br /> <br /> edit: Apparently other more mental reviewers I think since I didn't like this movie, I'm an "obvious hater" that I can only assume means I'm phobic, which of course is not true. I decided to do this crazy and crazy thing and judge the film based on the real content of the film and not on its simple presence (ie its refreshing to see ...). Sure, it might be refreshing to see, but that doesn't amount to a great movie, just give them a better material to work with and a tighter direction. In fact, I appreciate the effort. Frankly, I'd rather listen to my Kitchens of Distinction catalog than watch it again.
