The long list of "big" names in this film (including the ubiquitous John Mills) didn't bother me to the extent that I couldn't judge the film on its true merits. It is full of stereotypes, caricatures and standard scenes, set from the humble hero of aviation to the daring newsboy. The musical track was such that at a certain point, about an hour before the end, I thought that the film was finished: strong, growing, growing, and then ending the silence, but then the film continued! I did not find a real plot, a random script, but well-pressed uniforms and the lovely Jean Simmons (pre-nose work) with a little song. I can't say that this image has some of the ingredients that make a movie great. I found him maudlin, corny and underage.
