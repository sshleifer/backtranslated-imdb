This film was conceived in an extremely inadequate way from every point of view except technological. I got up and watched everyone come out of the theater, their faces drained as their lives flashed before their eyes - eyes wandering toward their neighbor, wondering if they were the only ones. I mean, how could the movie be really bad. No one will admit it, it's a classic case of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. "Who am I to question a film that contains a boy who stops an ocean liner?" But the fact remains, every member of the public is thinking about what I'm writing right now. I actually plagiarized their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously Lois is only excited by power, he won't even have a cup of coffee with Superman With Glasses that doesn't stop jet-jets. It cannot be the look in "his" eyes to the depths of his soul or something. In old Superman, he had a certain level of connection with him, obviously he was not the number 1, obviously, but he strengthened his character which was "torn". I bet Henry Kissinger would also win this Lois before Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now it's official, Kryptonite gives Superman what he eats at McDonalds is average. PERSON. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" He loses his father of earth, then finds his true super dad, the story is captivating at every step of the way. He is human, he relates to people and feels love for people, he relates to high school students, he relates to people who feel different. He refers. The Superman Returns superman seems to relate only to the Superpeople and it seems that he is simply "doing a job" when he is saving people. <br /> <br /> There is something in Clark that Lois likes, she is really in love with him, but she can admit it, and when she enters the scene as Superman, she throws a knot in dreamlike love. Without Superman, she would have fallen in love with Clark (at least that's what the film refers to, whether it was the intention or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, Clark is like a bunch of hands to Lois. Literally. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN DUE I just looked at it again. As a child, I "thought" that I liked the action, but now I know that it was HISTORY that caught me even in that moment, watching it over and over again. If I saw Superman Returns as a child, I too would have hated it, I think. <br /> <br /> There is so much heart, soul and superpowers going around in this movie, it's sick. Superman renounces his powers for love while a worldwide plot is happening and meanwhile, MEANWHILE, Lex Luther has something fantastic in his sleeve. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN THREE Now there is a threesome between Superman and Lana and Clark, only humanity wins and the inner nature of Clark beats the power of Superman, because when its nature SUPERmoral has disappeared and it is SuperHUMAN (which does human things with its superpowers), sees that it is not the power of Superman that it is in love with, it is not SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman who loves - and who is really SUPER. And when he tells Clark that he "prefers" him to Superman, he is euphoric, he made a human connection again. He wants to be accepted for what he is, not only for his ability to bend steel. THIS IS THE KIND OF ROBUS THAT LEAVES OUT OF THE SUPERMAN. <br /> <br /> Clark super sneezes to help the boy get a strike - humanity again. Furthermore, it is an INHERENT use of superpowers. It doesn't just use brute force. <br /> <br /> Crush the coal in a diamond for his woman because he had to sell it, love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers except to save. <br /> <br /> It seems that there is nothing at stake in Superman Returns. Also in Superman Three, we see the damage caused by the plot of the world domination of the nemesis .. we see suffering, we see how Pryor and others and people in the middle of it .. there is no damage, esp. emotional from the plot of Lex to sink the United States. We see a crystal globe thrown into space .. Superman had to become very creative in the first three Superman to stop the plot against him, he could not simply "access" his superpowers. In the first, he had to stop two missiles going in different directions and then break his universal mandate and cancel the story to save Lois's life ... (this was 30 YEARS AGO!) "In the second, he had to overcome in cunning three guys who were already MOST POWERFUL than, but combined with the genius of Lex, and the immoral tactics of the wicked, Superman's bullying was not enough, he had to work against each other and outsmart them ... In Superman III, still his superpowers were not enough to win .. He had to outsmart a computer that calculated everything he saw, he could not use a direct attack on the computer because he calculated it in advance, so he had to use a benign acid that only become deadly to the computer after the computer responded to the attack and discovered that acid first when it could not simply use its superpowers to take out a fire because it was a chemical fire, so it had to using his super little ones - he could not carry water, so he froze a lake and dropped it on the fire ... Now in Superman Returns, he simply pushes the island towards the outerspace, like a night for UPS. He doesn't need to understand anything, just use his "super strength". And Lex Luther's brilliance was shown at the premeditating level of a junkie who has just finished trash. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the fact that he threw that island into outerspace after being stabbed with a KNIFE of kyrptonite into the bloodstream And the island itself was dripping with kryptonite spores in the face, but it was limited to take his eyes and nose away as if he weren't Gray Poupon watching.
