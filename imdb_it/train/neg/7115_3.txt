Ok, so the introduction, with its hockey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fear during the movie, is so lame that it's fun. And so the first "skull scene" is so elaborate and without suspense that it's fun. The actual plot of the film is pretty decent, there is at least some genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the twist is as decent as the horror movies. Acting is average, not really bad. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film is not at all flat in the way a 1/10 film would do it. It is not so terrible as to get the lowest score or even the lowest second. If I only read the script, I'd say it could be a decent movie. It's just the horrible direction and production that ruins the film. So it's a bad movie, but there are worse ones.
