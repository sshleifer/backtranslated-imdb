OK, apart from the psychedelic background image, the information presented here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit at all with this movie). <br /> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director often invokes the existence of Christ without the pagan perspective and a surprising comparison of the actions and events of Christ's life against the lives of mythological figures / divinities like Mithras and Dionysus. Then he brings up the chronology of the origins of Christianity and presents an "ok" case, but not one that upset me. <br /> <br /> If the director had attached himself to the facts and continued with them, this film would have been good. However, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally gratifying attacks on the "Passion of Christ" by Mel Gibson and a private Christian school that the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal, (which over time came to light on the fact that the director was created under false pretenses) I heard that the director was acting in a childish way. He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on the rules of this particular private school, not Christianity. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're just interested in some information, look at the first 30 minutes or so and turn it off.
