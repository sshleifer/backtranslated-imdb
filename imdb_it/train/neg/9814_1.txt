This is the kind of movie you regret having inserted in your video recorder. It's a strange, loathsome version of Stephen Kings' film "Misery (1990)". I can't understand how this film got a score of 5.2, because it doesn't have a story like never before, and when the movie is finished, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This film should have been published as a short film instead .. you spend a lot of time for the same thing. And like in every bad movie, everything happens at the end of the film in 10-15 minutes ... <br /> <br /> So, before deciding to watch this movie, make sure you put some new batteries in the remote, because you're about to do a lot of fast forwarding ... don't worry, you won't lose anything important.
