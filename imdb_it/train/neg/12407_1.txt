Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a live babysitter for the young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie loses her dead mother a lot and continually visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery just behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> starts well with a really scary sequence in the cemetery ... then it falls apart. The story is subtle and there are tons of padding to make the film 85 minutes long. The acting is terrible across the board (with Cole easily being the worst). Bad director with some of the worst changes I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes (and the sound) are interrupted without any rhyme or reason. Even the film has a terrible (and obvious) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> As for blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what is there seems incredibly false. I've never seen such fake blood - it looks like ketchup! Boring, useless - a rightly forgotten drive-in movie. You can skip this.
