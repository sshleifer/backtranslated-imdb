I've never seen the original film of the series ... I just hope it was a much better film than this or the sequel made in the 1980s, as if it weren't the way these two terrible sequels were justified. This film had a great advantage when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are now a thing of the past. However it seems like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a film that would have made some Walt Disney films appear obscure. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with practically no inlet creek creature to see. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very strong storm, apart from the fact that there is practically no sign of the creature that was really disappointing as a child. The story is basically that the old evil hunters have to kill everything they see and are in search of the boggy breek creature and the children are out to help him or just a random hairy guy in the woods who likes to pull boats randomly across the water . It is not really worth looking at I would still like to see the original, guaranteed to the creator of what would have made the creature also very bad in the 80s, but also made a great slasher film in the 70s ".
