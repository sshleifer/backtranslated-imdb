I'm a big fan of Charlton Heston. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this film. Normally, if you've made a bad movie, I could blame the writer or director, but in this case it's all him. The suction of this movie is all his fault. Show that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and will never have that time again. This is by far the worst Heston movie I've ever seen. If you are a fan of Shakespeare you may find this movie funny, but if you are not, you will not waste your time, you will regret it in the long run.
