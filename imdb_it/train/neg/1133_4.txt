I've seen romantic comedies and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts of one. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play way, inserted strictly to fit the genre of romantic comedy. Usually this is good because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge generally lies in making it original, new and inventive. This film fails to do so. <br /> <br /> He has no idea who the characters really are, except for Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this film, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√© and become nothing more than simple puppets that serve the purpose of a very light narrative. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the film can become annoying, the rhythm is missing and the editing is full with useless close-ups. I should also mention the excessively stylized decorations that make some scenes lacking any naturalness, or rather, making the attempt to seem naturally too obvious. Of course, along with that, you have the right sapphire music at the moment which unfortunately often sounds mismatched. <br /> <br /> I can't believe that a movie that makes Woody Allen's allusions obvious ends up being deceptive. If you expect a good-hearted romantic comedy, this is not it. Or rather, this is a poor attempt. You will only leave the theater asking yourself why this film has received such praise when the cinema is over 100 years old and there are far superior directors who make better films. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a good movie for What. But it's a bad thing if you consider cinema an art and directors like those of an author.
