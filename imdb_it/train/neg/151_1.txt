This is really terrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that redeems this film is that the next time people ask me what the worst vampire movie I've ever seen is, I have an adequate answer. <br /> <br /> I think it's shot on 35mm, so it's bad taste already. I wouldn't have bothered to comment, but I noticed that some fans (probably connected to the movie) had claimed that this was the best film since the Matrix. Let me debunk the myths and lies. <br /> <br /> There is nothing good in the film. All is awful. The actress is ugly. Combat choreography is the worst I've ever seen. The fighting scenes are incredibly amateurish. Imagine a girl waving her arms in a helpless circle and throwing weak kicks that wouldn't hurt a kitten. Of course, the director simply took people out of the street to assign them roles in the film. <br /> <br /> I know that the director didn't have much budget for the film, but the best films were made earlier with smaller budgets. Unforgivable.
