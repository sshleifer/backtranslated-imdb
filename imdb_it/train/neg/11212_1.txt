The premise of this film was pretty decent, but with the minimum of acting, it was simply dull and boring. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS The film does not work due to the nature of death, it was accidental, so even if it was a murder, it wasn't as if the boy had decided to do it. Even through some flashbacks there is a secret that reveals that it makes events like justice. There is no emotion in this film. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman who calls her sister and listens to her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With a little polishing, and better acting, it could have been pretty good.
