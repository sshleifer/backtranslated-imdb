Abysmal with a capital "A". This must be one of, if not THE, the most ruthless show on TV right now. I'm as bushy as he is, but this show doesn't even make me laugh. What you think of Bush as president has absolutely nothing to do with this piece of shit. The "jokes" are not funny at all. For example, in a scene where lil bush has underwear on his head: "Welcome to the al-qa-eeda camp!" There is nothing funny about this. Should it also be a joke? The commercials that were shown in the weeks leading up to the show, exaggerating, were more fun than the show itself, and it's just sad. We hope this is not even considered for a second season. He shouldn't even have had a first one.
