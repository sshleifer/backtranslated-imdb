I am stunned by the positive reviews of this really uninspiring film. <br /> <br /> Often with foreign films skip reviews that complain of slowness and apparent "lack of action" given that many of the best international films do not live up to the model of Western Hollywood film fiction. <br /> <br /> I like the frequent cunning and lack of clich√©s in the foreign cinema arena. I like that many foreign films do not tie things together in a neatly beautiful little bow. <br /> <br /> That being said, this particular film did not offer any redemption value for the time I wasted looking at it. No significant character development, no engaging story arc, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A handful of colonials with abused and emotionally immature prejudices mistreat their slaves, and a little girl is hurt by her only friend when the "house boy" eventually gets tired and takes his abuse her . <br /> <br /> While the preceding paragraph is intense and dramatic, this film will bore you while you play the scenario. I was so little involved that it took three sessions to finish it, and I wouldn't even have done it if it wasn't for the positive evaluations. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period, I strongly suggest you avoid this.
