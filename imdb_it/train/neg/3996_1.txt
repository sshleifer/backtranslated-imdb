I don't see what everyone likes about this movie. The set-up was too long and talking, and when it was done, the main character remained flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene. After the film finally brought Cusack into the hotel room of the same name, I had to ask myself, well, what will happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged. The answer: not much, only John Cusack who has a long, exhausting mental exhaustion. <br /> <br /> Maybe if Cusack's character had more depth. . perhaps if his whim was a more complete reworking of his daily life. . . perhaps if the film had or rather developed its themes cooked on loss and faith or had not attacked them in the first place. . . perhaps if the film had made the choice to be a psychological horror or a thrilling horror and had fully embraced one of these styles. . . I do not know. All I know is that I saw this movie with two other horror fans and none of us really liked it. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the disturbing episode on the hotel's ledge, the alarming madman with the hammer, and the guardian of the crypt so stupid-is-was-fun in the air duct, everyone three of which represent no more than five minutes of screen time, this film was a bore. <br /> <br /> By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here to achieve much less powerful effects. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?
