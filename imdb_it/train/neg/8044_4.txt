Well OK, I watched this movie just over 2 years ago and now I pulled it off the dusty shelf to watch it again and I have to say, actually I think this movie is good. This movie caused a stir as the bootleg I Know What Did Did Last Summer 3, very similar to Final Stab was Scream 4, and well this movie is not so bad. I mean he had flaws and obviously it would be ridiculous to publish it in theaters, but anyway for a midnight popcorn movie, this movie isn't bad. He has some fears and some really hot women I could add. He also shows the new look of Joey Lawrence, although of course that never brought him big Hollywood roles too ...... I feel bad for the man, he had a similar career at the beginning and in the middle of the years 90s with flowers, some Disney movies and the eternal Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit of a player in the sitcom scene, but then, as in a 360-degree turn, his career went south only making low budget movies like this. > <br /> The film also takes you by surprise, makes you think among the crew, there is really a secret that someone knows, only to be disappointed in the end to discover the secret. He also throws you on who the killer is, I had an idea, but I still don't think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret were a huge disappointment. Now, was there a secret that had been released? This film may have been one of the best-ranked films. But I'm also a sucker for college themes and I went to spring school on a beach house similar to the one in here, so it made me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> so fast. Good for a midnight movie.
