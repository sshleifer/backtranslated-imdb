I wonder who, how and even more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to direct the most unique feeling of hitting Broadway in many many years? He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi, idiot! Jeremy Irons is an Academy Award-winning actor, do you want to see him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a beautiful war" have you forgotten? To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of living energy has survived the heaviness of the proceedings. Every character danced wonderfully, they were fascinating but their projection was theatrical. I did not hear anything. But when I saw him on stage I heard everything. The film should have been interpreted by stars, strangers, newcomers, but protagonists with irresistible irresistible faces even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Well, there was Michael Douglas. True, I have forgotten that I am absolutely wrong and you are absolutely right. Nothing like a Richard Douglas musical by Richard Douglas.
