Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) as a dollar shop Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... well, it's STEPHEN DORFF for Christ SAKE !!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for their hard work and effort. You guys are up It's an idea, it's just my humble opinion that the film becomes public but directly follows your previous choices, a film about the brilliant brilliant neurologist of history has invented a pill to cure all the diseases never known before man and get this, here is the tire must be interpreted by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love it. Seriously, you owe me $ 7.50.
