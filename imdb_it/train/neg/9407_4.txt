"Houseboat Horror" is often considered the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher movie, which bore the promotion "See the movie that can't get an Academy Award". A group of underground disco bands begin to die cut to death by a burned-out maniac while they are trying to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback. Easily played and written slasher with zero suspense and annoying characters. It certainly gives blood: the heads are divided in half with a machete, the throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe. If you like slogan movies, you can try this, but you have been warned. At least it's better than the Swedish "The Bleeder" .4 out of 10.
