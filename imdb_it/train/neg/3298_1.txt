When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard were going to be redone with current actors and a solid script, I was like, "ok, I'll give it a chance, it won't be better than the first, but we'll watch it happen." Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great show of the 70s / 80s that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood writers can't come up with something original these days. They seem to have a great show that has had a great target audience and try to "REMOVE" the classic show. CAPTAIN IN Hollywood ... IT'S NOT A JOB !!!! Anyway, more on the show. I think they could have played a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler of American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and exploited. Also, take it seriously, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. How low can you go ?? An asshole fucked actor to play lovable Luke. This makes me sick. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was intelligent, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good southern girl. It was the growth of the role model of all girls! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thanks a lot !!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart, 2-bit slut ass like Daisy Duke. Daisy was never a blonde. Because they had to call her. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. He can speak with a great southern accent, and he is beautiful, and he would have done a great job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew up something fierce. I feel like I'm being robbed by paying $ 8.50 for tickets, and they should repay my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) you don't see this movie. It will only make you angry. CMT (country music television) plays the replicas of the dukes throughout the night. So set up your TIVOs and follow the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
