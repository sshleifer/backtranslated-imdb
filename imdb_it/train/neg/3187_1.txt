From the star of "MITCHELL", from the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are slogans that normally prevent me from seeing this movie. And the worst part is that all the statements above are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad "Coogan's Bluff" remake
