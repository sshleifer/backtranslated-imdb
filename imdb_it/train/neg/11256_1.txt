What a waste of time! I tried to sit down with "Sky Captain .." about 6 times, and every time, in about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else! It's a very boring film, acting is terrible, boring writing, and obviously a director for the first time, because it's rigid and I wanted to love it, I love science fiction, old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate trying to nod to Flash Gordon and Metropolis, but my God, than to waste money: I worked for Paramount Pictures, and I wrote Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using the blue screen for screen tests, he told me they would never have any interest or need to do so 10 years later, Paramount released this piece of shit, Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten his own advice when he highlighted this dog: the blue screen has an effect, but not an entire movie. Neither Jude nor Jude are terrifying actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a scholastic effort. Too bad, it could have worked and, but only under an experienced director. the funny thing is that the director of Sky Captain will continue to work, even after this dreck. It's trade, not art!
