Final score: 0 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> *** Possible scene-specific spoiler (but who the hell cares) *** <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true: zero. And I rarely do 1. Even for the smallest of films I look for things like music, cinematography, imagination, a sense of humor, even a good rhythm to be as objective as possible. Looking at it within its genres or subgenres. But here there is absolutely nothing that redeems. I can't remember another movie actually sent me to walk up and down the room when it was over. The only reason I came to the end was because I couldn't change channels - I just sat there in amazement, watching to see what an insulting stupid bit would come later. It was like watching a snake digesting a mouse. <br /> <br /> But let's have fun and let's separate this child, right? First of all, there is nothing technical about "Whipped" that works. The images are all sitcom style. The cut scenes are just photos of road traffic that passes by night again and again. Music and the soundtrack, not only do not contribute to the film, is hateful. Not to mention the fact that it has nothing to contribute anyway. The acting is cardboard as it comes, all around and this applies to Amanda Peet (clearly the "star" who got the wreck of this illuminated train). These kids, presumably good friends, no longer have the chemistry or sense of purpose, if the director Peter M. Cohen gathered them at a bus station a few minutes before the shoot. <br /> <br /> On the creative side, there is no original bone in his body. He has no imagination. It shows us nothing we haven't seen thousands of times before. The whole premise, or "twist", of this film is based on the facing of males and on the idea that authorized women can interpret men "just as they are played". Anyone who thinks this is somehow a breakthrough or somehow original, obviously has never turned on a TV before. Twisted and superficial women are common. Tomboy is the norm. It's not stealing anything in particular, it's worse: it's stealing from clich√©s. I can't imagine a woman making a film that depicts other women based on stereotypes and this sense of contempt. Makes me want to rent "In the Company of Men" - or better yet, "There's something in Mary". This film wants to be an "angular" version of "There's Something About Mary", so bad you can see the sweat. <br /> <br /> The film has no insight into women, men, encounters, sex or anything else. Cohen is simply glad to regurgitate the myths that he has been indoctrinated by other sexist films. On the other hand, even the film does not work like a satire, because even if it is mature with exaggerations that can be considered "satirical", it does not have that foundation in the reality that satires need. He doesn't even know what is satirical. Then there is dialogue, which is little more than the characters screaming obscenities at each other. Example: Character 1: "F ** k you" Character 2: "Oh yes, well f ** k you" (repeat) <br /> <br /> And the bottom line, the thing that could excuse all other discretions: there are a lot of films without textures, without good acting, with morally repugnant characters and intricate dialogues of obscenities that were fun and, therefore, good. "Whipped" is not fun. Not for a second. He has no comic or timing skills. The situations are completely false, not based on any bit of truth, in particular enough to make us laugh. The characters are all generically designed in such a way as to ALWAYS appear to be traceable to the minimum of the lowest common denominator. Just look at the scene of "hair scene", "cult classic". One of our clumsy anti-heroes opens the medicine cabinet and sees Mena's vibrator (Peet). For some reason the light shines on it as if it had found the Holy Grail. Because Cohen thinks that men react this way to vibrators that I don't know. While he rubs himself, he drops it into the toilet and then tries to catch it with his bare hands when, oh my, Mena comes in to him. Oh, my sides. <br /> <br /> But strangely, people like this movie. Of course, people also like "friends" and appointments with reality, so I shouldn't be surprised. However, all this has a common thread. "Whipped" is a great test for me that there is only a huge amount of people in America who laugh at any joke just because it's about sex. They will like any show or movie (or think they like it) just because it is about meetings or relationships. The lack of quality has not brought these people to light. Just as people are indoctrinated to want whiter teeth and thinner bodies to sell toothbrushes and weight loss programs, they are also indoctrinated to blindly stone any relationship / relationship related to cheap, empty, effortless TV sales. and any number of products. <br /> <br /> The only consolation will be that when I die, because I saw this film, I have the merit of getting back 80 minutes of my life. <br /> <br />
