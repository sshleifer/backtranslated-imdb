You know a movie is ugly when the highlight of it is the chance to see a brief moment of "Jeopardy!" <br /> <br /> The saddest thing about White Men Can not Jump is that it has enormous potential. For several years, I lived in an area very similar to the one portrayed in this film; racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone. A film about the members of this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but the mediocre acting and the poor script of White Men Can not Job left much to be desired. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events of the film is cyclical. First, Billy wins or loses money playing basketball. Then he returns home and sits down with his girlfriend; and the process is repeated. Most stories accumulate somehow, but the "climax" I saw was just another sequence in this repetition (in this case "Billy wins or loses money playing basketball"). <br /> <In order to develop a plot, some problems must be solved; and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is also interesting. Apparently the writers of White Men Can not Jump have forgotten this rule, as the plot can be summed up as "Billy needs to pay the bills". I appreciated the change of pace compared to other formula sports films, but - I'm sorry - this was just awful. I could have worried less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, White Men Can not Jump is a hit movie. Apparently some adamant sports fans reject the terrible writing for some scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, have been attracted by the big names who play the main roles. This leaves me wondering, if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors, and the theme of basketball was replaced with lacrosse, would anyone have to worry about watching this movie? I really don't think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this film two out of ten stars; the extra star is for "Jeopardy!" scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek.
