I see that many people liked this movie. For me this was a good movie to write 101 and the person failed the lesson. From the moment Lindsey Price saw the videographer until the end, the film was very predictable. I kept watching to see if it went somewhere. <br /> <br /> First we have the young widowed father. Cliché # 1 film / TV always kill the parent mother if the child is a girl, or a brood of boys so the single father can be passed out on his dead wife and seems completely out of his element to take care of children. Starting from My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads. These films are usually dramas and comedies are television programs. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When an intrusive woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play an important role in the film. And he will always have solutions or even if that person is an empty head <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person in danger is a foreigner he must be of Latin origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently there are no legal and illegal European citizens, unless there is an element of the IRA involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 The Latin saying must be highly educated in its native country. In this case he was a Profesor who earned 200 per month. And the aforementioned latin educated must now act as if he had no brain in his head now and let the air hit his head. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime committed by the person was not a crime crime but an accident. But because in this case he lost all the sense he had when he crossed the border and now he acts like an exasperating idiot and now he has endangered his daughter bringing her into an unsuccessful search towards the border with the idiot kick. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 You never run on a thug who runs away from a crime, but a poor cute kid. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the film, and since the person who killed the child by mistake can have a ridiculous interaction with the parents. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 7 Give me a movie name in which a policeman is not the angry vet and they are paired with a novice. Even if they are homicide detectives they have to be the most experienced police officers in a police force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order immediately come to mind. And the veterinarian, even though gruff outside, has a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> Clichés # 8 Let's go gather some unemployed Soap Stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO cannot act from a paper bag and when she used to be in One Life To Live as Marty fluctuated from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It serves to hurt the sea. It might be better anchored on the ground now, but it can't still act. <br /> <br /> The film could have been more insightful if it weren't full of clichés. I don't think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But this was just ugly. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm not going to ruin the ending. Oh hell I'll do it because I feel that it will be a disservice to humanity to waste time on a person who will never come back to watch this movie. It involves the clichés n. 6 and n. 7. Unless a person has ever seen a movie before having to see what was coming. The father even makes a more stupid mistake as he runs to the cops at the end and is hit by an angry veteran, who all of a sudden is very upset. You'd think he thought the poor boy was innocent for the whole movie and she shot him by accident. When he didn't. Now for the little girl that dad brought with him. Guess what happens to her? At times, she ends up with the family whose son was killed by his father !! Come on! You all knew it would happen, because it is a replacement child !! That's why she didn't go to live with the character of Lindey Price. <br /> <br /> This film was an insult to me. Because there were so many ways that this movie could explore and it went down, but chose to do the cliché. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the little girl, which I thought was very good and Lindsey Price who was an annoying character but did what she could with it. My advice is to take a habit and squeeze the head with it instead of watching this dreck
