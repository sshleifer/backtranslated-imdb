I expected to enjoy a romantic comedy with Hip Hop, but I was disappointed on many levels. First of all, the story is so badly recycled that it is almost unbearable. Secondly, the setting, the acting and the plot are not very authentic or credible. Third, there are many good black actors to choose from over these standard choices. What about some originality? Thirdly, there were very few Hip Hop songs played in full - if there are any. No one seems really central. Overall, the film was a huge disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and made the film worthwhile.
