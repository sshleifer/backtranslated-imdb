As a longtime fan of all the Star Trek series, I found this episode disappointing, and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashback" with Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative ( a lot of pain, and the death of a crew) was a device to save money, as were many of their "bottled shows" (episodes in which all the scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also appeared at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Even faithful viewers (in the world of Star Trek, are there any other types?) They were also of short duration. This was the last episode of the second season; therefore, the season ended "not with a bang" but with "a whimper".
