I have not been able to decide if this film is so bad that it is good, or, to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so badly it passed again good and bad again." It doesn't matter, it forced me to look very much the same way that a bunch of strange colored vomit could, and offers a number of scenes you won't forget even if you want to. There is a young grinning Ray Liotta who tells Pia codino that his creative writing trophy looks like a penis. A little later, there is still Ray, molesting Pia, not with the suitably shaped trophy but with a garden hose. There's a certain Chinned Pia who tells the bully mother that she wants to sleep with Ray's father, Geezer, Walter. There is the actress in the cemetery scene who shouts the best sentence ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYYY!" There is that garden hose again, while Walter sways Pia's face and roars "It's better for you!?" There is Pia and her date so turned on by the close-ups of every other chewed salad that they start tearing each other's clothes. There is Pia who takes a shower but forgets to take off her dress. Perhaps, above all, there is Pia's typewriter, but instead of the keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who tormented her the most (later, I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally there is Pia at "The Awards" that expose Hollywood for the cesspool that is, spitting out the second best line ever, "I suppose I'm not the only one who ever owed her **** up. "I see I've already spent more time commenting" The Lonely Lady "than I did on far better photos, so I'll stop. However, know that once you start looking at yourself, you probably won't be able to look away from the screen until two hours of your life are gone forever.
