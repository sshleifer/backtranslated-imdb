There is no way you care about any of these characters. A group of spoiled middle-class kids take drugs at a party and leave and fight. I've just seen it on TV and I didn't think it was a "movie" as such, plus a post-'This Life 'indulgence that actually has no resonance or drama suitable for it. Such things will be commissioned from time immemorial, unfortunately, irrelevant middle-class "lifestyle" blabbery that takes itself too seriously. There's David Baddiel in it and that "Cold Feet" bird, you know what to expect. There was a lot of stuff like that in 2000, it was a particularly British malaise ... "friends are educated and do drugs, but a little dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships, it sounds great!" This kind of nonsense, and post-Guy Ritchie stuff - gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have taste, this annoys you to the point of violence.
