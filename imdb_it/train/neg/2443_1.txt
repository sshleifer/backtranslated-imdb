this is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. it's so bad I found it very funny. the acting, oh my god, the script, you have to joke. how can you imagine that the writer invented things like: - a child who makes fireworks at school, fireworks so powerful, that when someone is hit by it, they fly back a hundred yards and explode. - a girl is trapped in the celler, the killer is trying to open the door. she gets a drill, but the thread isn't long enough. first it creates an extension, oh the horror, and then, when it's done, it pierces the door and pierces the killer's head. WOW - and there are many other examples like this. oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy was great (Lightning and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
