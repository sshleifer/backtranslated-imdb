So why does this show suck? Unfortunately, this is really the only question, because there is no doubt that it does. <br /> <br /> For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show, the endangered Cavemen series focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in today's America and is based on the characters present in a series of TV commercials for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid and there is every reason to think that it can be performed successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then the advertising slogan - something with the effect of "Us" Not very different from you "gave me the key to the suction of the show. Also if the cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species from humanity, the main characters of this show, it turns out, are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the my background as a game writer - rather than a soulless, commission-based Californian writer - but this show had so much potential, and none of it was done. To begin with, the producers should have focused on the fun things that they would have made the cavemen different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, for example, in giving them occupations as perpetual students and furniture store clerks, when they would have been attracted more attractively institution by things like underground operators and guides in the parks of the caves? Why should they play prosaics like squash, when an entire episode could be dedicated to them trying to get hunting licenses to go after the spear game? A show like this could write itself, and it takes a bit of bad writing to make it rather crappy and boring. <br /> <br /> Another annoying aspect of this show is an attempt to portray cavemen as subject to number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more sadly than this. And, as noted above, Neanderthals are indeed a different species, so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotypes is both unpleasant and imprecise. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including those of anyone who wants to tell me why I'm wrong I'd like to enjoy this show and I'm just sorry I wasn't able to do it. <br /> <br /> Michael J.
