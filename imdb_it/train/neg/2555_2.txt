This film is probably one of the most horrible horror movies I've ever seen. The length was not long enough to include a good texture. Furthermore, the way the adoptive parents died was simply ridiculous. Does the mother suddenly die after falling into a shower after tripping over an action figure, and her father is hit by a police officer? I can see where the originality might have been for what they were looking for, but it could have been better. Moreover, the generosity of all this made me want to stop before it was over. After hearing all of Lucy's name and realizing that it was "Lucifer", I wanted to make a gag. Yes, it's interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It is a male name. It should be given to a male character. All in all, the film was boring and could have used a better storyline.
