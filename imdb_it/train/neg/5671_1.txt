If you like to see animals being flayed alive, their heads broken, dogs with their throats crushed, my men trampling them, then this is for you! But if you're a little normal and you don't need to see real footage of animal cruelty, pass this. This film tries to shock the viewer, and it certainly does. With the sniffed animal at the beginning and the killing of children in the film (at least fake) it was enough to make me turn off. I've seen movies like this before showing the slaughterhouse footage (BTK movie) and this kind of footage shouldn't be allowed in a horror movie. We look at horror and horror because we know it's just makeup and special effects, so we shouldn't sit and watch a movie and see the real killing of animals, it's not what we rented the film for. If there is something, there should be a big warning label on these types of junk movies, so people won, they will be surprised. Being a very hardcore horror fan, this turned my stomach. The entire cast of the film and the crew need to check their heads.
