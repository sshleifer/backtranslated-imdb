I'm an actor, producer, director and what I'm about to say are facts. This project was the worst film in the history of cinema. From the producer to the director and the modification of this so-called film is a joke and I mean a big joke. Why would Blockbuster release such crap? I take my job very seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad film? I don't think so. I've seen ugly Zombi movies, but this brings the cake to Coffie and everything on the damn table. THIS FILM HAPPENS !!! I really hate to speak ill of other directors because I'm one too, but please consider taking a different profession. Compared to the fact that you have completed a movie, but I have to ask you "YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK", I mean your girls' makeup, the scary Zombies, what you were thinking. For the whole nation, if I could vote for Zero, I wanted to. WORST MOVIE IN MOVIE MAKING HISTORY !!!
