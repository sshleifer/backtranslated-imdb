Kirstie Alley, looking a little thinner, but just a little, is in this mess with a man who is a MacGuyver double, bleached blond hair and all the rest. The premise of the film is about an elderly woman (50 !!!) who fails to produce her script because of age discrimination, so she sends her youngest nephew to pose as a screenwriter. Not an original idea and not a great film with bad acting, crazy dialogues and a ridiculous plot. There is another story about a writer with a crush or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who plays Kirstie's brother is so wooden and uncomfortable, it was a torture to watch their scenes. What is there to say about this film. Avoid it.
