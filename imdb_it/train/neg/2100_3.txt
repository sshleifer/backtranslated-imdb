You would think that the first landing on the moon would have been quite dramatic without having to invent things about it. However, this documentary seems to need to throw everything in the scariest possible light. He talks about the risks associated with the lunar module and mentions Armstrong's near-fatal accident with the training vehicle, as if the trainer and the spaceship had something to do with each other. It makes the problem of computer overload (alarms 1202 and 1201) encountered during the final landing sequence sound like a near-catastrophe when it was just a nuisance and not a risk to the crew. And it takes the "thirty second" call to mean thirty seconds of fuel left before it ends, when in reality it's thirty seconds before the break is mandatory. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary or dramatization of Apollo 11, choose "From the Earth to the Moon" or one of the PBS documentaries, but skip this.
