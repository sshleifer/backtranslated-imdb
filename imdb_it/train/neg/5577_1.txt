Somehow they summarized the 60s, ten years that radically changed our country, in four hours. And what a pain it was four hours. They turned the main events and happenings and "claimed" that they were two families, but you barely saw the African-American family. If I were an NBC I would be ashamed and ashamed for airing such garbage. What was funny was that this happy and fortunate family that you saw at the beginning was tortured in many ways, but managed to participate in all the major events of the 1960s throughout the country. And the second family was such a factor. They have dedicated perhaps five or six scenes in total to this family. That poor son ... Please, NBC, don't make films about other eras ... let it be PBS and History Channel
