SPOILERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> I've seen half of this film and I didn't like it <br /> <br /> First reason: boring. Something barely happens, women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke grass, they read magazines, they take care of their sick friend and they cut the occasional corpse. Second reason: there are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps casual men, portrays them on a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about the illegal activities concerning sick meat eaters? Why does he kill one and leave another? <br /> <br /> Also there is this guy who at first thought he also had the meat that ate the disease but put his fist through a wall with a superhuman strength that suggested that it wasn't quite what we initially thought , he never explained! How frustrating is it? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found the annoying women, the uninteresting story, the boring duologue and the non-existent action. Even the cover is misleading as it makes you believe that this film will be beautiful when it clearly isn't. I rented this movie based on some reviews made by other people on this site, and although I respect the fact that some people liked this movie, from now on I will make sure to read more than two reviews in depth in a film so to avoid renting another movie I'm sorry to see it.
