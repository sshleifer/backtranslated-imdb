In general I like horror movies, but unfortunately this fell from the only pound in the hands of my friends. We sat watching him, ready to be scared and ended up spraying the food wherever we laughed so much. The concept is not so bad, but because they decided that the number ten of the series would be lucky, I don't know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was poor, the special effects really aren't bad if I'm generous, but overall the story failed to connect at any level because the actors were as effective as a small mass of badly charred elm. They were disproportionately wooden, especially a young mad actor who was fifteen years old to be taken seriously as any kind of government agent. Indeed, he looked more like a public school boy. There was a really funny sex scene where he seemed to be bumping apples while a prosperous lady rode over him and later her diaper pants were hysterical, but then I remembered it wasn't a comedy. I'm desperately destroying my brain to find something positive to say about this movie apart from the occasional flash of breasts, but it's just not. Hopefully ten is the lucky number and they don't make another one, I'm not sure my ribs can take it.
