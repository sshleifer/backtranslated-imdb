I had the "privilege" of participating in a special screening of "The Absence of Light" at a horror convention in Ohio. <br /> <br /> First of all, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a film, saying, "Now keep in mind, we didn't have much money ..." Not that films without a budget are bad, but when a director uses this as an excuse, the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this deceptive sleep party. <br /> <br /> Actually, "Absence of Light" marks a first in the world of underground cinema: it's the only time I've seen a dream cast of talented vets that bore me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister come and go casually from the film and prove to be just as uninteresting as amateur non-names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Who cares? It's all so boring, you'll stop worrying about anything or anyone. <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. Not surprisingly, so did most of the cast members present. <br /> <br /> Any fan of the curious genre would do well to stay away from this. With a little luck, this film will never see the "light" of the day.
