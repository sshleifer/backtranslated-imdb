Well, this is a typical "straight to the toilet" movie. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, a group of teenagers / young adults stranded in the middle of a gruesome wood and are cut down by naked nymphomaniac demons. <br /> <br /> This film has all the bases for this fromage slasher: <br /> <br /> -Naked women, -teens or young adults are abandoned in some spooky, -great scenes of death, -l 'Lastly, the survivor is a well-built young woman who will always show her navel, but never without a bra, a fearful and mad man who knows the scene of the evil kiss, sex is a murderer, a plot <br /> > Again for a poor slasher film, it was really terrible. The atmosphere is completely dead. Nothing, not even the sexually explicit scenes and nudity, was enough to keep the female male and female lesbian public interested. Looking at him looked as if he was observed with bad head congestion or a bad cold. <br /> <br /> From the demoniacs ..... 0/10.
