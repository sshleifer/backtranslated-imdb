Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje for Angelina Jolie) wandered into a wasteland of the apocalypse (after his protector died of old age, said the protector is played by Elias Koteas, a decent actor) and now he discovers that people roam the rubble in search of cyborgs for metal scrap and money trade. Lead a group of burned cyborgs (which includes William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human scientist played by Zach Galligan) against the bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 manages to be better than the other two items, but it's still a largely boring feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used well, action sequences are routine and the cast of names like McDowell, Katt and Galligan has little to do. Haje is really a whining heroine and Lynch is too exaggerated (as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as much fun as his hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the second is just boring.) The science-fiction angle is also disappointing, resisting almost any good idea. Like an action movie this is routine and B-film numbers and it's done competently, that's the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on 4 (Poor)
