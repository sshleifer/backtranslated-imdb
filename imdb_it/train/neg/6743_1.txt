How many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream-ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is quite original but the film itself is a complete failure. First, the dialogue is poorly developed, it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, acting is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this house smells worse than a skunk.
