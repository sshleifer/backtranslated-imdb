Final score (an average of various classic cinematic qualities - acting, graphics, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, etc.): <br /> <br /> 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> Had " Atlantis: The Lost Empire "released a few years ago would have seemed a new bold and serious direction in the Disney animation. However, it comes only a year after the innovative and almost brilliant "The Emperor's New Groove" and marks a step back in liberating Disney from its repetitive "Disney Formula". I'm a big fan of Disney feature films. They must see them all love them or hate them. "Atlantis" is a return to the animated past of "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version barely contains an original idea. It looks like a remake of something, even more than the real Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than a walking clich√© of the usual suspects that typically populate these types of films (strange mechanics, general gongs, cheeky women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) the supporting cast is unpleasant. The film also suffers from its succinct rhythm. Instead of enriching it in an epic story, Disney dives a lot into the usual short time spent touching opportunities to develop ... suspense, characters, anything really. They throw us into this wonderful new world and barely allow us to meet our obligations. The embarrassing rhythm sometimes confuses what is a relatively simple story. Animation is dark, sad and inexpensive. This thing looks like a Saturday morning cartoon together. We hope they haven't forgotten that traditional 2D animation can still be wonderful. "The Iron Giant", among others, proved it. <br /> <br /> Negatives: the graphics, the rhythm and the absolute lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positives: most likely the coolest death scene for a bad Disney in a long time. It is the creative culminating moment of the film.
