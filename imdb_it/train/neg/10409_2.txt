As if the plot was not depressing enough, this film shows the graphically slaughtered cows in a slaughterhouse for all five minutes while the protagonist tells his first life as a butcher. Strange things. Then there is the main premise of the hero / heroine who leaves and cuts the duck because a man who does not know the job says he would go with him if he were a girl. Is this person a psychopath, a masochist, just a doomed queen who takes things too far? And what kind of traumatic childhood did he have? Only he was not adopted and had to live it with sisters who at first loved him and then hated him because he was unruly. Try to explain to us the reasons why you did what you did, but it's really very difficult to empathize. Such sad and unusual self-destruction. Should it be fun? What was it really about?
