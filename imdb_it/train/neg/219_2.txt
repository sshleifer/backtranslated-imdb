It could have been a good movie if he had explored something more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if that was the meaning of the film ... it is quite predictable not to mention that the two girls look like the Russian tATu group. ..coincidence? I don't think so. There is nothing original about this film to support it, so they had to use something that is already famous. Know the recipe. The other actors ... well, I really don't know what their role should be. Most of them are well known in Romania and I have to mention that some of them are not even actors (for example Mihaela Radulescu). I summarize it: "tatty girl" + desperate / advertiser who needs "actors" + a non existing plot + the opportunity to use bad language to shock = to love badly .... sin ... the idea was good, though ... and I'm seriously holding back from commenting on the title ...
