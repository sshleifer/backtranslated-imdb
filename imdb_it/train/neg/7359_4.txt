Anyone who has watched some Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that the credibility of the plot is the first thing that is swept away from the planning table. So when the crazy Lara moves into Patti's house and begins to methodically drive her landlady, I haven't even flinched. When Lara eventually increases her activities to threaten poor Patti, and challenges her to do something about it, I just nodded. You see, in Planet LMN, people don't act like they do for a particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. Only on Planet LMN could anyone have the owner of a house thrown out of their home by their seductive powers !! Poor Patti - she trusted too much and Lara took off her medicines, and then there was a big fight at the top of the stairs with a syringe full of deadly things that ended up being injected into someone's belly, and a body bag coming out the front door. Horror! <br /> <br /> But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You have to watch it once, only for the great laughter you'll have. On the improbability scale, I give this film a 95/100. Make a large amount of popcorn and also take apple slices. You will understand later.
