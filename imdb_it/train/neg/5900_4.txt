Attractive young Japanese are still on the wrong side of some curse, this time involving mobile phones. Several people die until the dissatisfied spirit is unearthed, so basically if you've seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films, you can plot this movie in the dark with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> the attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I've been more impressed by his low-profile works like City of Lost Souls, however, while I missed a single Missed Call, I wanted his most famous envelope pushing Dead or Alive or the overly pseudo-Cronenberg style of Audition. Although many of his films are essentially empty, at least they have merits like these, or at least something to keep your attention as Tadanobu Asano who struts in sparkling clothes impersonating Johnny Depp. There is nothing of all this in One Missed Call; there is only little credit: the acting is insignificant and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in terms of fear or suspense, and in some places it is decidedly boring. <br /> <br /> However, there are times when Miike's sense of humor spreads through blatant commercialism; in particular, with the instance of the television show intent on filming the disappearance of one of the cursed subjects, and the television programmer more concerned about his evaluations than for the life of the girls. But apart from that there is nothing to suggest that it is Miike behind the camera; in particular his usual visual style has vanished without a trace (and this includes his famous gore), although he is more likely to have had no enthusiasm for the project, and I can understand why. A missed call is not badly offensive. It's simply frustrating in the media. <br /> <br /> Miike obviously loves directing. With its huge annual production it is obvious that it will not be 100% concerned about all its projects. But even with that in mind, One Missed Call felt like it was paying the bills.
