Welcome to movie 17 on the classic 50-piece pack. Where we will see, it is true. Another film that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie confused me in the end, I thought I'd review "A Dawn they Sleep". The plot looks simple enough ... well, this is up to 3 seconds in the movie where a girl supposedly killed a cat and then ... er ... explodes? I have no idea what happened. and that was BEFORE THE TITLE SCREEN. It's really sad when I can't even tell what happened in the first 3 minutes. <br /> <br /> In any case he is the protagonist of a photographer with a big mustache who finds this girl after downloading his other girl on the road to take pictures of something somewhere so we get there, but not before someone steal their jeep to drive it 200 feet away to a city. suspected? nah. so they decide to stay in this deserted village with an old lady. and then something happens bla bla and bla bla talking. The guy with the mustache goes off in the fog for some reason even though the old lady tells him not to. You lose and then find your way back. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention that all this is after an incredibly useless 20 minutes that remain in the house of a guy who looks like a boy with the buggy eyes of Casablanca. Then they leave. There is really no sense in this scene. It's really just padding. if you cut it out no one would have noticed or cared for it. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately this was the best part of the film. wait. let me reformulate you. REALLY sadly that was the best part of the movie. because the rest is so confusing that I had to look at IMDb to find out what happened. But obviously nobody else knows it, so I'm SOL. <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film were some of the most shocking moments I've ever seen in a movie. They dressed her in a dress, he is kidnapped, then released, he runs back into the house, then in the end the witches are at home and ends? seriously. I've never been so confused in a movie. I mean, as bad as movies like "War of the Robots" are, at least they make MAKE SENSE. this film does not even make the ATTEMPT consistent. the ending was confused like the end of "To sleep" and the plot was much more boring. This film gets a 1 just for its pure "I have no idea what happened in this movie". "Witches mountain" receives 1 confused cinema guardian out of 10.
