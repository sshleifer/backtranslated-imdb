This film was pretty much sucked. I'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. If you're in the military and you see this movie you'll laugh and you'll be upset about the whole movie because of the way they acted as a team. It was ridiculous. They acted like a group of normal people in army uniforms to not know what to do. It was a rather bloody film that I should say less. There were a couple of scenes where they tried to blow you up. I would recommend seeing it if you are bored and you want to see a violent and bloody movie. It will be a better film even if you are not in the military. I must also say that I liked the first one better than this.
