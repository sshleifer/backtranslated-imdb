This must be one of the worst films of the 90s. When my friends and I were watching this movie (being the target audience), we sat down and watched the first half hour with our jaws touching the floor as bad as it really was. For the rest of the time, everyone else in the theater started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying in their popcorn that actually paid some money they had earned by working to see this weak excuse for a movie. It must have seemed like a great idea on paper, but in the film it seems that no one in the film has the slightest idea what's going on. Crap acting, crap costumes. I can't understand how embarrassing this is to watch. Save yourself an hour and a bit of your life .........
