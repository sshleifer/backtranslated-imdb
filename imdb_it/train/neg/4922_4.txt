DRACULA 2000 is a horror film that was continually screened on Sky Movies in the UK and considering that it seemed to be projected about three times a week for a whole year I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until the first broadcast on the television network tonight . Actually since I'm not a big fan of horror movies, the reason was probably due to my theory that this would be tripe. My theory proved to be right for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of stupid scripts involved. For example at the beginning of the film the villains are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (in a turbo-powered two-engine aircraft!) And one of the villains is left alone in the hold where Dracula comes to life. A fight breaks out, there is a lot of noise but the bad guys in the cockpit don't hear a sound until the script requires it. Dracula also appears to be able to control time in this segment's climax, but this seems to be forgotten as the film progresses. Wrong script, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there are numerous scenes of characters at the New Orleans mardi gras, so the characters are in a different position like the police station in the following scene, so they returned to the mardi gras the scene after the one that means the lack of credibility in the plot has been improved <br /> <br /> There is something else that tore the chain away from me - product positioning. There is a huge scene in which the logo of a certain record label / chain of shops is in full view. I do not allow myself to advertise the company brand (except to say that they also run a railway company which is a national joke in Great Britain) but I had the impression that this type of advertising was against British guidelines and I am surprised that the BBC have shown this film if this is the case <br /> <br /> There are some positive aspects in DRACULA 2000 like the images for example. This is actually a good-looking movie with a good-looking cast and the guy was hot with those vampire girls, but it's something we should expect from Hollywood in the last few years - A very nice movie that's very stupid
