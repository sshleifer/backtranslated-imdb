William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation, and in that moderately amusing way, it was considered appropriate to broaden his role and exaggerate. Just like it happened in the original Star Trek series. I believe I will never understand American humor, which frequently goes 'over the top' to get the message across. I vote with my feet. I no longer watch the show, which is a shame, because the rest of the cast was good. Too bad that even Shatner's exaggerated role influences James Spader's performance. But the majority shows the way society is going, I guess. I don't travel the same routes. Franco
