I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now I know that people will say that the prequel was made on a limited budget, but that it never had anything to do with a bad script. Now maybe it's just me, but I always thought that a prequel had been made to set up the other film, played by key characters and maybe fill a little life that we didn't know. Rise to Power is just a movie that has the name of Carlito. There must have been at least some characters from the original film, the ending makes no sense in relation to the original. At the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him out of jail in the next movie? And her woman is not even the same woman she talks about as her only love in the original. I would say that the film is pleasantly amusing, with few decent ideas, but it pales when it comes to the older brother. Don't stay up at night waiting to see it, look at the original one more time if you really need a shot.
