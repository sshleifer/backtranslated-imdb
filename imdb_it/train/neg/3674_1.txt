Note: I will reveal a fundamental part of the plot, but if you have watched the DVD cover or any promotional material, you will know it already. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have been written by an eleven year old who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and the NSA seem to manage the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these intelligence masters hunt for someone whose simple touch will kill you in a minute or so they don't wear protective clothing (not even gloves). These are quibbles in the context of this film. In the scientific world of this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity goes sideways. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the people in this film do not behave as humans do (with few exceptions). Almost every time a character responds to something it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes soap opera scripts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
