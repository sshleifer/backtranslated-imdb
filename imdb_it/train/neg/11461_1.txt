Please don't waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - don't do it. Especially if someone is lucky to doze by your side. Damn, if you ask me. I waited for something to happen, it never happened. I'm not one of those people to stop watching a movie in part. I always have to see it until the end. What a huge mistake. Do yourself a favor and go paint a wall and watch it dry - much more fun. Please don't waste +/- 2 hours of your life watching this movie - don't do it.
