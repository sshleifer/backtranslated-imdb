This movie is nice to look at, but it's like watching a really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) makes no sense. But it is very "artistic". So many shots of half-dressed actors fighting and looking into each other's eyes. Lots of artistic shots through the windows and with people outside the frame. Mumbling and people wandering sadly. Close-ups of faces and bodies. When you get to the trio on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY on the screen. <br /> <br /> It should relate to the relationship between father and son, but you'd just like both to be limited to a reason. If you've always wanted to see ugly Russian gay porn without money shots, your wish has been fulfilled.
