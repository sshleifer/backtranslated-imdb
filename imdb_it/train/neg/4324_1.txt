The stupid Griswalds win the grand prix of the "pig in a poke" television series, and they all fly together to Europe where they manage to cause one stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous and little fun sequels that run money, this beats a lot. Harold Ramis's 1983 film was a sub-average misadventure in which the maladjusted family went on a nightmare "vacation" in the United States. This time Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking") elaborates what turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" that will bother you more than it can make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The script by Hughes (with Rob Klane) is horrible and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo took the trouble of such a deadly project, like Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca they had the good sense to refuse the offer. Even the omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to raise the proceedings to a level that could be described as humorous. <br /> <br /> However, as inconceivable as it may seem, "European Vacation" has had enough success to justify a second sequel! Surely it couldn't be as unbearable as this. You know, I still have to see a national Lampoon show that was worth it. <br /> <br /> Monday 26 December 1994 - T.V.
