I can't believe I spent an hour and a half watching such a weak movie. If there is only one movie not to be missed, this is it. Robert is a teenager whose father died recently, so he starts dating some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. All this makes him unconsciously more violent and eventually such an unconscious explodes ... <br /> <br /> The first thing is that I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character . If the director considers what I saw in the last two minutes as a great ecstasy, I must say that it is not even close. <br /> <br /> Even the use of cinematography is not mature. Most of the time I couldn't see the actors' facial expressions and I didn't feel that body language was enough to make an impact. Perhaps the crew was so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. All happy except the public. <br /> <br /> The plot is particularly weak. There are many independent scenes and dialogues that could be related but they are really so random that you can never bring them all together, maybe unless you are the one who wrote them. <br /> <br /> In the hour and a half you can find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all the other times there are only people who walk, talk and move. So I can't comment on the acting here. <br /> <br /> Good choice of music in the last two minutes. Perhaps this is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> I have never given a 1 movie but this film definitely deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled adolescents meets an extremely disturbed audience. I hope you don't fall into any group.
