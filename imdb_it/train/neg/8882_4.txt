To call a film about a paralyzed ghost that takes its revenge beyond the grave and lifeless would be too ironic, but this is an undeniably indistinct combination of GASLIGHT (1939 and 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while it is still watchable in itself, it is so obvious that it causes clich√©s instead of intentional chills. However, thanks to the terrible difficulties in which the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a mediocre screenplay like this was able to attract names of 10 stars - Cliff Robertson (as a conniving husband), Jean Simmons (in the lead role), Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's half-sister), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as an unfortunate doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson), Judy Geeson (in the role of Simmons the best friend and wife of Jayston), Flora Robson (as the housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary who reads the will of Simmons) and, perhaps more surprisingly, Jack Warner (as a sculptor of gravestones) - although most of them actually have no parts, I'm sorry to say!
