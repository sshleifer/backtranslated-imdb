Where to start. The film started pretty well, but after the 30-minute score, I caught myself looking at the watch. The horror at the beginning of the film was good but then the story started. He became more stupid and stupid over time. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this film however, I got a little bored by Vinny Jones, who continues to frown in the film. <br /> <br /> As the film dragged on, and believe me on the word, it was dragged, it became increasingly exaggerated. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the film could not get worse, towards the end it charges if looking skeletal monsters, just to eat dead people that didn't make any sense. It turned out to be a sort of meat cult and eventually the good guys die. The ending actually made me just laugh at how bad it was. Once the main role is of Vinny Jones, it becomes the new killer. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made. I gave him 1 star because the female protagonist did a good job but even she couldn't save this movie train !!
