Today I found "They All laugh" on VHS for sale in a rental. It was a very old and very used VHS, I had no information on this film, but I liked the references listed on the cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten appealed to me, the price was very low and I decided to risk it and buy it. I searched IMDb, and the 6.0 User Rating was an excellent reference. I looked in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? Wow ?? four stars! So, I decided that I couldn't waste any more time and see it immediately. In fact, I just finished watching "They All Laughed" and found an overrated and very boring movie. The characters are poorly developed and I spent many minutes understanding their roles in the story. The plot should be fun (private eyes falling in love with the women they are chasing), but I haven't laughed all along. The coincidences, in a big city like New York, are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with women falling in love with him as if he were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is rather ridiculous. In the end, the most important attractions are surely the presence of Playboy playfop and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by her husband after the release of this film, whose life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death of a Magazine: the story of Dorothy Stratten "; the extraordinary beauty of sexy Patti Hansen, the future Mrs. Keith Richards; the always wonderful, despite having fifty-two years, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", by Roberto Carlos. Although I don't like it, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60s and is called by his fans as "The King". I will keep this film in my collection only because of these attractions (virile Dorothy Stratten). My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso and Muita Alegria" ("Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness")
