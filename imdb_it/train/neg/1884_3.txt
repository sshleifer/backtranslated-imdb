Fragmented film about a couple of people in Austria during a heat wave. This type of film has been made more often, and above all, better. The stories really have nothing to do with each other, apart from the pathetic ending: "people are cruel". Bad meat, unpleasant people and a film that goes on too long without really making a point ... Ultra-realistic? Hardly ... boring? Indeed. Not even the splendid Franzisca Weiss can save this! 3/10
