Yet another British romantic comedy that audiences around the world seem to have a voracious appetite for. This weak effort is an involuntary parody of the kind - all the classic clich√© scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to run after the departing trains to declare their love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures except Love-Hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. Things threaten to get out of control in the plausibility department as the movie progresses; our good-natured suspension of beliefs finally comes down during the absurd final. If you're looking for a Bridget Jones, kind of an experience in Notting Hill, you won't find it here.
