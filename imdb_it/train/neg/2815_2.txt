Poor Robert Englund makes another flop and at the expense of Tobe Hooper, who usually makes rather good horror films, but this has failed quite badly. Englund plays the well-known Marque De Sade who in the 17th century was imprisoned for his obsession with pain and the pleasure of bringing pain to himself and also of watching others suffer. The story is so confused with flip-flops from one century to another and I became confused about what was happening and what the purpose of this film was. All I saw was a young woman trapped by a strange lesbian who wants to keep her for herself and the young woman was fascinated by this Arab with a lot of money and discovers that he is out to kill her and then Englund intervenes for a century to another claiming to be a descendant of de Sade and trying to kill her because she reminded him of Mrs. Momoselle (badly written) or whoever was in the picture above De Sades's wall. The film was terrible, I was surprised by Hooper for hiring Englund in this film and the special effects were so fake and laughable, especially the part about the eyes. Englund tries to make a return from his move "Nightmare on Elm St." using these pull-in and out-needles to put out people's eyes. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
