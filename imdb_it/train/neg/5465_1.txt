This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. It's as fun as doing hard manual work with stomach cramps. The film starts badly (I would rate the first few minutes of the film at 1/10) and then progressively gets worse, minute by minute. The only way to evaluate it would be a sort of negative abyssal spiral that grows for ninety, long minutes. Unfunny is not a real word but best describes humor in this video. Somehow the video also manages to make cute and poorly dressed women and girls look grotesque and unpleasant. This film is incredibly bad. I would say that it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme by playing again and again and with the ESCAPE FROM LA Buscemi character that buzzes in your ears rather than watching this movie. The sequels are not so bad. If you need to rent a Troma movie, take Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I'd rather watch 5 Tony Infomercials back to back than see NUKEM HIGH CLASS again. Don't get me wrong, it took a sort of criminal genius to make a film so terrible and if a movie ever deserved a prize for being terrible, it's like that.
