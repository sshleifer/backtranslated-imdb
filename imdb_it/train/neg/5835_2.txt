Ah WINTER KILLS, based on the Richard Condon novel about a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago. I knew that Condon had also written THE CCHIDIAN MANCHURIAN who was dealing with a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing a clever thriller. <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. It's not a thriller - It's a piece of shit with no value, maybe the worst movie I've seen this month and, boy, I've seen a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies both in the direction and in the script and since William Richert was responsible for both, then he should be entirely blamed for this unhealthy farce <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this movie. First of all it is the way everything is presented in a way that is completely above average. It is not as OTTto as to say something like this in the James Bond film with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but all this has a very marginal side with the actors who completely afflict its performance. This could have been justified if there was entertainment value for the film, but there is none. As a satire it is very foolish, so foolish that it becomes almost unwatchable. Secondly, the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they are meaningless. Take for example a scene in which the hero is faced with a cyclic militia leader named Dawson. Dawson tells the hero that he has 30 seconds to start, then he cuts to the hero on board an airplane. The scenes begin and end without either rhyme or reason <br /> <br /> A terrible film that is an ordeal to follow
