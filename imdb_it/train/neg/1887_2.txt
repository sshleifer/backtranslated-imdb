Today I had a discussion about why so many people complain about modern movies where I found a curious statement: "character development in the latest movies is not just as good or interesting as it used to be." Depending on the film (s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and Hollywood garbage based on the plot like War Of The Worlds, but in the case of excessive and uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put "art" back into the cinema, it's films like Dog Days that blame. <br /> <br /> Normally I have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how boring or insignificant I find them (ranging from good ones, long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to those that I considered painful to sit through an Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I close this 45 minute movie, which is 30 minutes longer than I should actually have. I wasn't interested in any of the characters and I didn't find anything substantial beyond a thin veil of blurred pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the scum of society, this film easily ends up being self-indulgent, trivial and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Of course, I've seen many disturbing films on the same subject, but there are so many better films out there about depressed and pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had nothing more than the dislike of an eighth grader for the company, choosing to ignore any real intelligence about the way people actually are, and instead of choosing to be a boring, horrible and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of "art". This is not a characterization of the unknown or an intelligent observation in the dregs of society, it is just boring and worth nothing to worry about.
