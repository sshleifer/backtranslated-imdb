I wasn't sure how to evaluate this film, since it was so bad that it was actually very funny. I'm not a fan of Gackt in any way, even if he has talent, despite the strange pseudonym that sounds like a cat coughing a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented, Faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the subject here people. This film is ridiculous. It's so over the top and foolish that it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The film has almost no plot here, except that it's just vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this film almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with the way there were too many ideas, which led to not having enough time to pay attention to one of them. <br /> <br /> The action scenes were ridiculous. Quickly modified, almost difficult to understand, with such ridiculous choreography. Although Hyde appeared very elegant during the action scenes, but this is the only redemption of this film. I'm a crap of good action movies, but the action was horribly done. Although the final shooting was OK and the highlight of this otherwise depressing film. <br /> <br /> Keep jumping between genres, it's not a good thing. It wants to be a drama, or an action movie, or a horror, or a love story ... what the hell. <br /> <br /> If this review is driving you crazy, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Don't fool yourself, this FILM IS BAD.
