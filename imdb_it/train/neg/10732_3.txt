The Russian film "4" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one evening in a local bar. One is a musician, one is a seller of frozen meat and one is a girl called. <br /> <br /> "4", I understand, is intended to show the monotony and desperation of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to invent stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they are in reality), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit down to the end. There seems to be a suggestion going through the film that the obscure Russian government depends on some shady behind-the-scenes actions - running secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so shapeless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could understand what's really here. <br /> <br /> Despite the decent acting and some incisive scenes, "4" is a two-hour competition that should be avoided at all costs.
