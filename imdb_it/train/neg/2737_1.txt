There are no spoilers in this review. There is nothing to ruin. <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; most of the clips show at least to tie the clips to the texture with a certain elasticity, but this has not even done that. Clip, three lines to insert in the next interminable sequence of boring clips ... OK, so maybe they were short of production time, but it would have been better to skip this episode entirely. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it was made. Scrubs are usually much better at subverting the tropes, but somehow this has crossed .... <br /> <br /> Thank goodness they were back in shape from the next episode.
