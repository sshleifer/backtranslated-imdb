David Arquette is a young and naive home security alert <br /> <br /> committed under the wing of Stanley Tucci. Arquette is a golden boy <br />, who made a big sale on his first phone call - to his widowed Kate <br /> Capshaw and his stupid son Ryan Reynolds. Things are going well for Arquette, appearing in safety commercials <br /> <br /> and falling in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> So Tucci and his right-hand woman Mary McCormack allowed him to <br /> <br /> on a little secret - sometimes breaking into their customers' homes <br /> to scare them and get their neighbors to buy the company's <br /> security systems. Arquette decides not to involve him <br /> <br />, bringing Capshaw to meet his family and living life <br /> <br /> with a silly smile on his face. Then, someone breaks into Capshaw's house and kills her and her son. Arquette suspects that Tucci, and sets up a series of traps, resulting in a gun at the head of his <br /> <br /> while Tucci claims his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a theatrical game, "The L'armarmist" does not open well. The scenes of <br /> <br /> where Arquette takes Capshaw to meet his parents are badly played and completely unattractive. They are also out of line <br /> <br /> with the character that Capshaw is playing while getting drunk and telling sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother, Michael Learned. Other <br /> <br /> of these scenes, Capshaw doesn't have much to do, but it does a lot with the little that is given to it. <br /> <br /> Stanley Tucci, who looks like Terry O'Quinn, is a riot as the owner of a security company <br />. It is a creep that does not really understand Arquette's moral repulsion. However, when he turns into a whining whiner after Arquette kidnaps him, it's hilarious. Mary <br /> <br /> McCormack seems to have been prepared for a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> she is mostly around and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> <br /> is too old to play a stupid teenager, but it's funny, especially <br /> <br /> telling Arquette his explicit sexual history. <br /> <br /> The script soon swings from the romantic comedy to the dark comedy. <br /> <br /> Capshaw is completely unmotivated when meeting parents, <br /> <br /> except to give you a reason to leave the city so that someone can enter your home. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film alone <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proven to be a good actor, is horrible here. He relies on constipated theft that he did through those AT&T ads, and is not strong enough to build this weak <br /> movie around. In fact, Reynolds could have been a better choice <br /> in the role. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will soon win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The light jazz score of Christophe Beck recalls the kind of film noir that this film tries to be, and it is really captivating. <br /> <br /> Despite the advantages, the failure of Arquette as a protagonist and the schizophrenic quality of the script sinks the film. I don't recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is classified (R) for physical violence, armed violence, a little blood, <br/> <br /> loud words, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual <br / > <br /> references and situations for adults.
