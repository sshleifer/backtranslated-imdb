Nick Cage is Gates, a treasure hunter (oh, sorry ... protector treasure, whatever that means) that descends from a long line of treasure hunters. One of his ancestors had been given a clue to the fate of a huge treasure that our Founding Fathers, many if not all Freemasons, had decided to hide because they didn't want to finance their Independence so badly. <br /> <br /> The first clue turns out to be in a long lost ship hidden in the Arctic. Gates and his crew, composed of the financier Ian (Sean Bean), the movie Dork Riley (Justin Bartha of the immortal "Gigli") and a pair of faceless servants, enter the ship's hold. Tons of gunpowder are immediately spilled all over the floor, not that this is significant in any way. Eventually they find the clue (a skeleton hovers over it) and turns out to be a pipe with writing ... on it. A type of. Don't ask me to explain. <br /> <br /> It's a riddle, and despite the fact that his expedition is clearly sorry he didn't find the real treasure, Gates hovers around himself on the meaning of the riddle, in this frozen cargo hold , while the crew stands with its mouth open. I mean, come on. Someone should have been a bit vocal in their disappointment to get to the crazy Arctic and not find anything interesting, but they simply stand there while Gates enters his world, solving the riddle. <br /> <br /> the next clue turns out to be on the Declaration of Independence. Ian decides to steal it. Gates is horrified. Various characters offer a much more obvious exposure (getting used to). All of this leads to Ian's footman throwing a gun at Gates, and the gunpowder explodes in a big explosion. (oh, that's why they spilled all the gunpowder! Huh !!) Ian and his henchmen flee, and Gates and the movie Dork Riley walk nine miles at lower temperatures than an Inuit village to stop them. <br /> <To stop them, Gates concludes after trying the FBI and Super Archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), Gates and Riley have to steal them themselves. Riley then tells Gates in heartbreaking terms why they can't steal the Declaration, because it's so protected by metallic and laser eyes and high tech security blah blah. Gates then tells Riley that there is an opportunity to steal him from the conservation room. Does Riley know what the conservation room is, asks Gates? "A place where they make jams and jellies?" I'm not kidding; this is the current line Bartha does not even deliver it as a joke. So Riley does all this research on the Library of Congress and on the Archives and on water and sewage, fercryinoutloud, but he doesn't know what the Preservation Room is. This practically indicates at what level this script is inserted. <br /> <br /> To make the rest of this brief, Gates actually face off with the D of I, in an irreducible break-in that could only happen in a movie. (I also hate the way they describe computer monitor technology in movies - full of unlikely and impractical graphics and fonts.) Abigail Chase ends up labeling itself for convenience, and as an obvious "love interest" angle. At one point, all three, fleeing the law, discuss all their plans aloud in a clothing store, surrounded by people. <br /> <br /> A series of clues and the kidnapping of Gates's father, played by a spiteful Jon Voight, leads good and bad alike in a huge Indiana Jones fun house, located under New York City . Strange that metro builders never found this thing. Gates and Gates Senior lead Ian on a wild goose hunt. Ian thinks he's trapped on a dead-end street and leaves them there. However, after they are gone, Riley asks how they are going out. Gates ... <br /> <br /> ... oh boy ... <br /> <br /> ... he presses a button and a door opens. No, I'm serious. A button, as if they were in a flush toilet in an office building. Fortunately he knew where he was. Anyway, after going around a bit more, they find this huge treasure room (remember, this is all under Manhattan!) Full of all sorts of historical gold things. Riley gets to deliver a really stupid line. Yet. FBI officer Harvey Keitel forgives them, arrests Sean Bean and allows the two leaders not to marry. <br /> <br /> For any spectator, I think it would be difficult to ignore all the exposure, logic jumps, and stereotyped characters for a long time. Although some of his exhibits involve beautiful history lessons inserted into conversation at random times. I'd like more conversations like that in my life.
