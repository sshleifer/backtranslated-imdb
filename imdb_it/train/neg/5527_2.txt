The zombie revolt is BAD. There is nothing remotely fun in the film. It's boring, lifeless, badly acted and badly scripted. I have often complained that the original Dracula is a bit slow for my taste, well this film makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The execution time of 65 minutes seemed to be 165 minutes. <br /> <br /> The story: an expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through "zombification". A man finds the secret and uses it to marry the woman he loves. Once this happens, release the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. That's all. This is the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, I was trying to figure out where I saw the male lead. He seemed so familiar. I had plenty of time to think about it. Nothing was happening in the film. Just before the "zombies rebelled", it struck me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as a general in white Christmas. This is how I "entertained" myself for most of the film. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and is a masterpiece of film production compared to this film. For what it's worth, I'll give a 2/10. (I won't go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)
