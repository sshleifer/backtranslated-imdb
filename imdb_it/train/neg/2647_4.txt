I will say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson - even when one is stranded in a joyless, brainless, painfully inept musical like this, there is still that glint in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is very thin. Even when the score is practically thrown away, non-existent depends only on a couple of catchy melodies. And even when the circumstances are so incredible - yes, even for a fantasy. <br /> <br /> The truth to say, he has more chemistry with Nelson than with his real husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN 'THROUGH, which, however, was a much better film. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her only issue of "hep" with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with a blank look at the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what it was like on Broadway in 1938. Surely, it must have had more spirit and style than it seems in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton has an inappropriate role and none of the support players can breathe a semblance of life in this mess. It's like an amateur evening in the studio even with the few professionals scattered in the supporting cast. <br /> <br /> In summary: painfully clumsy of a Rodgers and Hart musical. I can't recommend it, even for MacDonald and Eddy fans. And even if Jeanette's close-ups still shine with her spider web beauty, this movie is incredibly bad.
