I've seen other films on Guinea Pig, like Mermaid in a Botola and He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they have at least some sense of humor towards them (though obscure). The devil's experiment, however, is nothing more than filming a group of punks who subject a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there is no plot or saving values. It's not even remotely scary, except maybe the mind-set, but it's definitely disgusting and I wouldn't call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the comparison of good taste in movies and I like my garbage and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. I am all perturbing, in fact, I look for things that disturb when possible, but this has been a bit too much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, subjected to continuous noise through headphones until she drools, and then thrown with raw meat and entrails and left hanging on a hammock in the woods somewhere. If you think it sounds good, try it, but it definitely prevents me from seeing other things about Guinea Pig. 1 out of 10, absolutely nauseating.
