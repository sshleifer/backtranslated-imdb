This excuse for a movie doesn't talk about anything at all! Rachel Griffiths must have needed the money. The film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non-existent. I made a vow if I ever saw Pete Postlesumthingor, others will commit suicide. I would be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I lost time looking at this garbage.
