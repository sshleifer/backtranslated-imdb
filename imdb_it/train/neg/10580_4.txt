I saw it last week after collecting the cheap DVD. I wanted to see it for years, finding the plot very interesting. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the main actor was very flat. This type of part required a performance like that of Johny Depp in The Ninth Gate (of which this is almost a complete rip-off), but I suppose TV budgets do not always extend to this type of acting ability. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the management was confused and boring, only serving to remind me that Carpenter didn't make a decent film from In the Mouth of Madness. As for the story - well, I was disappointed there too! There was no way to meet my expectations, I think, but I thought the reward and explanation were scarce, and the way he finally got the anti-climatic film to say the least. <br /> <br /> This was written by one of the main contributors to AICN, and it can be said that he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise. <br /> <br /> I brought the DVD to the store the same day!
