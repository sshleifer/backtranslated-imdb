A typical Lanza movie that had a limited audience with a weak storyline that was put together to justify Lanza's MGM contract at the time. <br /> <br /> As reported by member Lastliberal (above) Grayson could not stand Lanza because of his obscene advances towards her (and sometimes up) camera. Moreover, his creaky mannerism and the continuous smell of alcohol on his face during the scenes they were doing together were intolerable. After making their second (and last) film together, "Toast of New Orleans," the usual quiet Grayson rushed into Louie B. Mayer's office and told him bluntly that he would never work with Lanza again? period. Mayer believed that Grayson was much more valuable to MGM and then Lanza, so Grayson's statement remained impressed. Grayson continued to perform in many highly regarded (and much more profitable) musicals with Howard Keel and others. Later in life, when he was asked to compare Lanza and Keel, his answer was that there was no comparison between them and that Keel was fantastic to work with and had much more appeal to "real people" in the public.
