This film was terrible. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot for the film. The only thing that was decent about the film was the acting of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the film did not do justice to their recitations. If the script had come close to capturing a story halfway, it would have been worth watching. Instead, performances by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones are completely wasted on a terrible plot ... or lack thereof. Not only have I been left waiting for the whole film for something to happen to make the film ... well, a real movie ... not just a dialogue without words between the characters for what in the end was absolutely without reason. It was nothing more than a common dialogue that would take place at that time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only special thing was how Robert DuVall portrayed an old wandering, senile, drunk man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie, including the end. When the film ended, I was amazed ... I was amazed that I sat throughout the film waiting for something interesting to happen to make the movie worth watching. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started filming, making it clear that the film was really finished and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The whole film takes place in a day's time. That's all. It was a day in the life (and death) of some southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in one day (other than the movie Training Day)? The cast's acting interpretations were excellent, but they were seriously wasted on a movie disappointment ... if you can even call it a movie.
