Why review good movies when you can review "Trancers II?" <br /> <br /> Ooh, this movie is really lame. I can only imagine the cast and crew that are running around L.A. with a video camera, throwing extras into stupid and long-suffering stupid monsters made up to Tim Thomerson. The families of the stars actually appear to play cameos, probably because Full Moon could not afford "real" extras. Blade effects, blade series and a script so complicated that it will take eons to untie all knots - this must be a classic Trancers! <br /> <br /> Yet ... yet ... governs. Note that this is the same thing I say about "Trancers IV". I say this because it is true. What can you beat by looking at an old man in a trench coat to mow the zombies, then burst with jokes like: "Don't worry, sir, they're biodegradable"? Well, many things could be better, but still this is still good stuff. <br /> <br /> My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, which really sucks. It's a lousy rival for the character of Helen Hunt - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would have been more effective if they had actually fought a little more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the "long second watch" is back in place, and we have more of Hap Ashby, the less convincing athlete in film history (oh, wait a minute - has a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in "Creator"). <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it lately, but I seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs twice during the final battle. Hurray for bad continuity! Only one of the many highlights of this beautiful film.
