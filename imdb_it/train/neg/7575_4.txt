A retired diplomat, played by Michael York, goes to Russia to take revenge on the Russian gangster who killed the diplomat's policeman. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him deliver the Russian gangster to justice. <br /> <br /> I remembered the old action movies of the 80s that always portray the Russians as bad villains that undermine the right government of the United States. It is interesting to see the Russian boy this time as a hero. <br /> <br /> It's not a great movie, it's usually an action movie "B". Michael York lends a little class to this mediocre film. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of a "blah", but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is an actor so good at having some chemistry with whoever is shooting a scene. Disappointing, the handsome Adrian Paul is killed within the first 15 minutes in the film. Now, if Adrian Paul had been longer in this film, it would have been an above average "B" action movie. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that it's really nice to watch for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is the typical villain. He is very blond and very bad in this film. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if there is nothing else on TV to watch. All right. It doesn't suck too badly. Action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot may have moved much faster, but hey, you can see what Russia looks like today!
