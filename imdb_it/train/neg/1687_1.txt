If you go to watch this movie, you will not lack of resentment towards the cinema, the director, the producer, the actors and the person who told you to go see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and your face in this poor movie excuse. It might have been scarier if Japanese actors had spoken in Japanese instead of trying to "act" in English. I wanted to whistle when the movie is finished ... a real disappointment after all the clamor on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle didn't really have to act to make this film ... she just practiced her frowning skills. Don't waste time or money on this movie.
