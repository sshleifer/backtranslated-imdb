In 1987, did John Hughes write and direct "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", a hilarious and moving comedy? the best thing I've ever done. Ten years later he was reduced to starting to recycle the plot of "Home Alone" in this second sequel, which is not related to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four scammers ?? that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series! ?? they are electrocuted with metal chairs, brains with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaaa ha, while the new baby is even less charming than Culkin. You would think that the departure of almost all the protagonists of the first two films would have prevented Hughes from fossilizing the usual old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he appeared for "Home Alone 4".
