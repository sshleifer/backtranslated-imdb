I don't think this film was properly evaluated. I took my copy and obscured the PG evaluation and noted R. I would NOT recommend it to anyone under the age of 17 or 18, whatever the limit R. <br /> <br /> Why? Contains a jungle scene with several topless Indian women. I don't know about you, but it's not something kids look at. True, it could be the traditional "clothing style" of African Indians (?), But ... I think partial nudity should give a movie a rating R. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the film recently, but I suppose otherwise, it was fine.
