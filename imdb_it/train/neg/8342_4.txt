Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror movie. Okay maybe it's not so bad. But it's close. <br /> <br /> Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is chased and probably killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is rather threatening and brutal). I say maybe because she wakes up and it was all a dream ?? .. or was it? (Cue music) <br /> <br /> The basic problem of the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (done quite well the first time) are repeated over and over again. And since Claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or an alternate reality, I simply stopped worrying about what happened to Claire and started to wonder what blade stroke would eventually do this. <br /> <br /> I was cheering for a seance (which honestly would have made more sense), but instead got one of those too obvious by surprise conclusions (Think of the village or below ) Yup the film collapses faster than what the directors of Donnie Darko have cut. All the big horror film endings of The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Happy Birthday to Me worked because the public didn't expect an explanation to the left. (Damn even the canoe that ended on the original Friday the 13th was worth it) <br /> <br /> The rescue, on the other hand, screams the blow ending with every scene change. Other annoying flaws are the piano note soundtrack (although the foreground songs were decent) the obvious filling of the tempo (Claire doing the cymbals, subthemes of Claire's mother), the way Claire says "bye to everyone "every time he thinks there's a serial killer around. <br /> <br /> Also some of the secondary roles (in particular Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander who looks like a zombie by Mary Kay) shows the first time that the actor's low-cost roots. <br /> <br /> Both too clever for half and not smart enough, Salvage keeps your interest, if only to see how they will solve this mess. The problem is that they don't really do it.
