I don't understand some of the great premises of this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable, and that there is something so ugly that it would drive you crazy. Someone here pointed out that perhaps it is the frequency of light waves or something similar to ugliness. Miranda is just an idiot. The episode is slow, inconsistent and too convinced. I also don't understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the Federation leave the damned Medusana? There is a part that I like when Kolos is talking through Spock about the solitude of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS and even to its utmost, I always tune in. This episode though - mmm, I wouldn't buy it except for a copy used under $ 3.
