The film My Name is Modesty is based on an episode that takes up about one page of Blaise's tenth novel called Night of the Morningstar. He describes an incident in which the young Modesty (17 in the book, in the mid-twenties of the film) states his leadership in a war for a casino. Since this is set before the real adventures of Blaise, his trusty helper Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the main problems as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was certainly always one of the fascinating aspects of the novels and the long comic strip. The other problem is that the film is simply incredibly boring because in reality it is just a small episode that broke out in a script. The casting is ok but Alexandra Staden is not really as convincing as the heroine and actually too old to play the role of the young Modesty. I had the impression that this film was a quick and dirty solution to not lose the rights to the Blaise franchise.
