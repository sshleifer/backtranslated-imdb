I agree with everything Calamine said! And I don't always agree with people, but what Calamine said is very true, it's time for girls to play better roles. I'd like to see them being very successful as they are a very inspiring couple and I'd like to see them grow as people, actresses and in their careers as well as in their personal lives. So, producers, please give the girls the chance to develop something that touches the tangent a little, moving them into a new direction that recognizes them individually and their talent in many facets. This film that is commented is not bad, but as I saw later in their films, their films remain the same as in the typical plot and typography. When in Rome it is good for an audience of young generations but the adults who were children when the twins were children want to follow the twins in their successes and so I think we adults would like to see them make films of various kinds, maybe some that are like the sixth meaning, the time, the chocolat, that kind of film - not saying that you only have serious films for them, humorous ones too, yes, but rather see them in different roles than they played in their latest films like this and New York Minute. (Note: I come from Australia so excuse my strange syllable as a reward with s instead of z)
