When I first heard of "Down To Earth", I was quite excited. I'm a big fan of Chris Rock, he was especially funny in Dogma. But this film proved to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance did not live up to his past performances, and the film was just misdirected as a whole. <br /> <br /> First of all, Chris Rock. Play the whole movie like a comic routine. Obviously, this works well in the scenes in which it should stand, but in the rest of the film, it doesn't. Even when he's talking to another character, he seems to think he's trying to make a room full of people laugh. He has some fun moments, but they mostly come during the stand up scenes (it's no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian). As for the rest of the cast, I'm pretty much there just to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stands out. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film was poorly directed. The film basically has a plot from a joke: old white acting like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, this could have worked, and it would have been pretty fun. The problem was that we saw too much Rock and not enough of the old white. It should be fun because this white guy is telling the jokes about Chris Rock, but most of the time, we see Chris Rock, so it's not so funny. The few scenes in which they decide to show us the white that speaks like Rock are, in fact, hilarious. If more had been shown, the film would have been a lot more fun. <br /> <br /> Overall, some moments of laughter cannot compensate for the fact that "Down To Earth" is misinterpreted, and badly directed. This was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
