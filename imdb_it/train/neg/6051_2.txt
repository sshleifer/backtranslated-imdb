Urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good storyline and a good casting. I saw this movie expecting it to be terribly terrible and unfortunately was disappointed when it was just terrible. I lost the will to live halfway. The only thing that prevented me from stabbing my eyes with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was the reason I looked at her first). He did a good job as Rastus and his appearance hasn't changed much since he was 13. It was a fantastic first attempt in a film. even the dog was very good. both did a great job with such horrible material. Sandra Bernhard I think it was the biggest mistake of the film. it was completely misplaced, and I don't think he ever had the character. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and this is only thanks to Rose.
