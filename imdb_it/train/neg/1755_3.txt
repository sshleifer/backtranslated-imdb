This film is not without its charm and also shows some warmth, but in the end this effort is too vain and too focused on leads. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with all her time on screen, but she takes too much of the limelight from the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the overload of the script with clich√©s. The daughter who secretly leaves the university, an elderly woman who finds it difficult to get a good job (and ends up with a rather humiliating job), the squalid network manager with her executive toys that open wide for the substance, the journalist who attacks for his beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with each of these, that is they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are simply too many and leave too much deja-vu and too few surprises.
