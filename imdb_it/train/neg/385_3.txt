Conspiracy drama / mystery poorly written about the possibility that AIDS was presented to the public by the government. Wlaschiha plays a gay researcher looking for answers - that within this misty plot it would be difficult for anyone to find. Although the film itself is commendable, the camera is hungry for characters of real depth instead of the superficial amateur acting that unfortunately has to convey. Degree: D +
