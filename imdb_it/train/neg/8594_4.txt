At one point, Violet (Lucy Liu) tells Neil (Cillian Murphy) that the reason she is constantly looking for an adventure. He said "because I'm boring-phobic". It means he can't really get on with his life doing some mandatory activities. Well, I think his reason and the way this movie goes is very ironic. Because "Watching the Detectives" is an encouraging bore. <br /> <br /> Are any of these characters doing something exciting for once? Neil is a misfit who runs his very small video rental shop. He and his other geek friends usually walk around the store and watch movies together while they discuss about them later. But Neil's life is completely filmed when Violet enters her store. She is an eccentric woman who hides a little secret from him. However, after some dates, they decide to meet. The problem is that Violet is a person who continues to make jokes about Neil and can't really do something normal, while Neil is completely opposite to his. The question is. Will they eventually be in love? You bet. <br /> <br /> "Watching the Detectives" is a romantic comedy clich√© in the middle. And they made it even worse by pretending to be something else. From the first pair of set ups, we know that Neil is a rather relaxed type who has never engaged in anything. And then, Violet comes on the scene, looking at everything weird and annoying. So at this point, we all know that we are going to sit in spite of all the meaningless situations to find out how they will end in the end. Is it worth the wait? I would say no. <br /> <br /> As I said, they tried to give something more to the public. "Watching the Detectives" is trying to talk about the commitment. To observe how far people go to get something they want. In the end we knew that the crazy things that Violet did was proof of how ready Neil is to go to win his heart (or whatever). Well, I think it's complete crap. This movie will end quite quickly if Neil just told himself "Forget it, that girl is one of the whores!" Recently, after collaborating with many great directors ("Sunshine" and "28 Days Later" by Danny Boyle, "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" by Ken Loach and "Breakfast on Pluto" by Neil Jordan, just to name a few), it's a rather strange choice for Cillian Murphy to shoot a movie with one of the Broken Lizard comedy troops, Paul Soter. In any case, he is not bad (as usual), but an actor as talented as he is should not waste his time in the film like this. On the other hand, Lucy Liu is terribly terrible like Violet. His acting is a mess. I mean, it's all over and overdone. Tony Montana would have been proud. <br /> <br /> The last, but not least, mistake of the film is a wholly irrelevant title. It is simply not possible to connect a point between the plot and the title; and then you will end up thinking that it makes no sense. In short, "Watching the Detectives" is nice if you forget about the cinema that you might have the chance to capture it on cable TV so quickly that you can't imagine. <br /> <br /> BloodyMonday Rating: 1.5 / 4
