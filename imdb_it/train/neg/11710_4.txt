There's only one reason to watch this movie if you're not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this story of slow and wildly unlikely revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film is played by Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to take revenge on her treacherous wife. Oh, but not by conventional means. Plan a total guerrilla war and recruit the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as a favorite weapon. He wants Nichole (like Tuesday) to approach his ex (the beautiful but boring Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to the music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good at his few short moments, and the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison has practically nothing to do but frown. Hiltz on the other hand comes up on various occasions sexy and playful, then bad and sneaky. He also runs vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic". It is also quite exciting (even if there are no mischievous episodes), so you can understand how it might be able to reach any boy for whom it is intended. But the performance is a little wasted on this film, which is not sharp enough or interesting enough to recommend.
