I love these actors, but they were wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> I can only ask myself, what were they thinking of agreeing with this crap ??? <br /> <br /> Debra Winger just called in; Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard were caricatures. Some people thought it was profound. Well, if you liked "Breaking the Waves", you'll probably like that too. I hated both. 3/10
