Zodiac Killer. 1 out of 10. Worst always acting. No acting worse than ever. David Hess (The last house on the left ??. None of the seventies ??. Rent is really good) is the worst of the group (A rather tough competition but he is incredibly terrible.) One would be very difficult to find a participant in the home movie with an embarrassing photographic presence. The film actually squeaks with a tremendous and painful setback when it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> It is not that the film actually has any saving qualities for the ruin of Mr. Hess. It is shot with a home cinema camera and with the appearance of things, a rather old one, complete with a connected boom microphone. Not even post production. Come on, there must be some shovel that a five-year-old computer could use to clean this image. It creates bizarre autopsy and aircraft carrier take-off images and this is a visually wrong image. The autopsy images are interspersed with the way in which Italian cannibal films intrude on those horrible killing of animals in real life. And the Navy footage should be an anti-war declaration (because we know that all the bloody maniacs join the Navy) What the hell is Lion's Gate doing to release this garbage? It would be embarrassing for Troma. The plot is about the Zodiac Killer (The last seen in Dirty Harry ??? No of the seventies ??. Renting it is really good) Someone gets hit in the stomach in Los Angeles and the cops assume the Zodiac Killer is back? Uh Huh. What can you expect from a film that does not know that the DSM IV is a book not a psychiatric disorder and in which the relationship of the older murderer resembles that of a Congress page and a closed deputy? The cuts of the eighties and the production values ​​meet with a Nambla subframe. Sign me up.
