The film opens with a long single shot of factory corridors crammed with workers. My, what we did to the planet you could think of. I hope we can see other things like this. <br /> <br /> It is very rare. When you're not looking at a horribly narrator's angle filmed in a conference room, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different places. It would be nice if you choose areas that are more suited to your topic but he doesn't. So, you'll still hear a little storytelling, watch some photos and watch it set up its video camera. Why not use the camera to show more landscapes instead? It really kills any sense of stimulation and paints the boy more than a useless jerk. <br /> <br /> I could read the suggestions on how someone set up their camera, advance quickly through the entire movie and lose much less time.
