I don't get enough evaluation for The Amati Girls and I think I'm VERY nice giving him a 4 out of 10. What might otherwise have been a wonderful story with a series of more or less decent actors actually became a total farce in my eyes . There are so many clich√©s in that movie, women's hair is simply horrible and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a group of actors who act beyond all limits that hurts. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so it's not good in my eyes. Looking at him I couldn't believe that something like this had come to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But ... maybe it was still OK and got lost in the translation? Who knows. Surely one of the strangest films I've ever seen and certainly not in a positive sense! Sorry.
