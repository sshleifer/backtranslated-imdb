This should be renamed "The curious case of the unscrupulous filmmakers who misrepresented a snoring not horror as a shock movie". It's a long and boring story of fraternity frivolity, a gag so transparent that even Flounder from the Delta House could see it. Jeff East, an actor on the paying stage, can be forgiven for taking any job he could get. The same cannot be said for Charles Martin Smith, who in the past performed for the big movie weights like George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but, fortunately, not on DVD. A badly interpreted garbage like this belongs to a landfill and nowhere else.
