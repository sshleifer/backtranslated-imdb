I imagine this would be a great film for a true believer in the organization of Christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thought, separation of Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction, it's a terrible joke ! br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors who have had a strong need for work or have needed to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us pagans. <br /> <br /> I entertained myself with this film in the same way that I was entertained by "Reefer Madness". That film tried to teach drug education with intimidating tactics in the same way that this film tries to teach "Christian" principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world . <br /> <br /> It made me scream with laughter and at the same time scared me into realizing how many people really believe that our society should go back to the good old days of the nineteenth century!
