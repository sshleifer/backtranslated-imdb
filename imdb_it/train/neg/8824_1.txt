What can we say about this film if not "the viewer pays attention". The Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes, because this was harmful to my eyes and my ears. I am rarely dissatisfied with a horror film "b", but this film could not even give a little fear to a child of five. The point of a relentless fool who is bloodthirsty in a movie is that he / she should almost look like a god, as if nothing could stop their manic rage, but in this film the resident psychopath remains stuck in a fireplace in a bizarre attempting to surprise his next victim and, of course, following Santa's popular legend with everyone, is a reminder to the viewer that this man is not at all dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all a total waste of films.
