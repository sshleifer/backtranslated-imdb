Devin Hamilton is probably best known as the new name in the legendary Full Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, his arrival in this independent studio occurred at a time when budget and production values ​​have been at their lowest for years. However, in his short career, Hamilton established himself as a creative director who manages to invent original and original stories. Now, this does not mean that his films are good, but at least they are different than usual in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> In his debut, "Bleed", Hamilton presents a creative touch to the subgenus slasher. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who finally gets her dream job. Not only that, but it seems that he also found a boyfriend for Shaun (Danny Wolske), it seems that life finally smiles for Maddy after many sad events. Until at a party with Shaun's friends, they tell her that they have created a "club" where members have to kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Obviously they're joking, but Maddy desperately wants to adapt, that she actually kills someone. After that event, someone starts killing the rest of the "club" members one by one. It is up to Maddy to understand what is happening, since anyone could be the murderer, including her. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character wonderfully played by the beautiful Debbie Rochon. It is a very interesting twist on the genre to have the actress starring as part of the suspects. The concept is so original and Rochon's performance is so good that it's a shame that Hamilton didn't develop the whole story a little better. The film seems pretty slow at times and overall the feeling is that of a good idea wasted on a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is strange, in the sense that all the female cast is very good, while the male cast is painfully bad. Danny Wolske is terribly wooden and his yuppie performance is rather stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in small cameos and are wonderful in their small roles. Also, there is a lot of nudity (both male and female) and the cast is very nice, so it's really an advantage. <br /> <br /> The low budget hurts the film in the effects department, as there are very few raw scenes and they are not really graphic (probably because they would look bad); however, considering the budget, the film looks at least good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's most recent effort, the Delta Delta Die! sexploitational adventure, is a more elaborate and more enjoyable film. While this is not as bad as other well-known films, it still has a lot of flaws and could only be interesting for Debbie Rochon fans or fans of independent films without a budget. 4/10
