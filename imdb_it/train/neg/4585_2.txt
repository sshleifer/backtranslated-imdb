I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this film, but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics apart from what I remembered from the excellent "Brief history of almost everything" and what I was able to stifle in "A short history of time," a sometimes it sounded interesting. However, the obvious absurdity of the history of the Indians of not being able to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous. I really started to question what at that point was a shovel, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually "channeling" a madman called "Ramtha" who completely changed the applecart for me. <br /> <br /> What a waste of two hours.
