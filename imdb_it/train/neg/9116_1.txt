There is no decent scene. <br /> <br /> Amy Adams offers one of the worst performances of all time. Try that you can start anywhere. Even the guy who plays Sebastian sucks. He doesn't even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The other two girls are terrible too. <br /> <br /> Then the dialogue is also disgusting. <br /> <br /> Sebastian (about to have a threesome): If you can't beat them ... <br /> <br /> Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat them? <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian have never had sex. One of the reasons why Sebastian wanted Kathryn so badly, apart from the fact that it was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was "the only girl she couldn't have and killed him." It was a provocative woman who liked to play with him. The fact that he had never given it to him increased his desire. So in this P.O.S., it implies that he can have it, along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see sex. It is implicit, making it not only stupid, useless and contradictory, but also worthless. <br /> <br /> And in the first, Kathryn refuses Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even if he won the bet, this has crumbled his chances. So in this excrement, he loses AND falls in love. So you don't miss the "losers", just the complete losers? Another thing: it is stated that Sebastian has never been in love, so what's the thing with Virgin Girl called? <br /> <br /> Then, in the end, the virgin girl suddenly reveals herself as Kathryn's lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, as I said, they enter a trio of canvases off the screen. Stupid. <br /> <br /> There are many other contradictions in the plot. Did the writer even see the first film? A 5-year-old child can indicate his stuff. <br /> <br /> After the threesome, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting his innocent mind in the back of a limousine while Kathryn and Virgin Girl turned Lesbian In Lame wrong. The sudden twist sits in the front, listen and smile maliciously in the camera. <br /> <br /> The end ... <br /> <br /> Seeing Sebastian become the asshole he was in the first could have made an interesting film. I guess all that was needed to make bad Sebastian was a threesome with two sexy girls. Interesting.
