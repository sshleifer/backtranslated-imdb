When a friend gave me a box set of "12 Amazing Scifi / Horror Movies!" I was understandably a little cautious. But since the object was a gift, I didn't really pay much attention to my common sense. After all .... free movies! So what if I'm a little ropey. After many considerations, Alien Intruder was the first of those films. Ironically, it was the first choice because it seemed the best in the group. All I can say is that if this is the best of them, I get the thrill of thinking about how others are. <br /> <br /> On the surface, he had some positive things. Four (counted!) Actors I was familiar with. Billy Dee Williams, Tracy Scoggins, Maxwell Caulfield and Jeff Conaway. I said to myself ... "Billy and Tracy have been in some good scifi (Star Wars and Babylon 5, respectively) so they don't sign up for a turkey. Max is a veteran who never managed to break into the movie ... ..but not too bad an actor, a Jeff ... well ... he did the good and the bad with regards to film and TV ". I will soon discover that Jeff had decided to add "the ugly" to his film repertoire. <br /> <br /> The first clue was in the opening scenes. Jeff makes his way through a "I'm crazy" scene before finally killing himself. A funny cameo, really. Unfortunately this is, without much exaggeration, the highlight of the film. From then on. <br /> <br /> Next we have the mission commander (Williams) who is sent to see what happened to Jeff and his crew engaged in choosing his new shipmates from the ranks of the criminal element. But this assortment is not so much the dirty dozen - more like the non-cohabiting quartet. In addition, one of the criminals, a computer hacker, is shown in his cell working on a laptop. Isn't it a bit like letting a murderer run a jail shop? Pretty crappy prison, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> When the effects finally take off they are truly horrible. It seems that the spaceship model was destroyed in an afternoon by an 8-year-old bored man who had left parts of his Airfix kits. <br /> <br /> But the horror does not stop there. As they make their way to the area where Jeff's ship has disappeared, the criminal crew is rewarded for their good behavior when given at the virtual reality weekends, where they indulge in their male fantasies. All well and well, and the use of scenes of their fantasies serves as an introduction to the "Menma Aliena" that begins to appear there. But did they have to drag him out for such a tremendously long period? Alien intruder? Alien Boring, more like. <br /> <br /> Finally they arrive at G-Sector and the alien presence makes them fight against each other for their affections until only good old Max remains. The ending, in a real vein of trash cinema, suggests a following - as if! Also making an appearance in this film is a character who will nickname "Sweatdroid". He should be an android, but apparently this fact was lost in the makeup group, which provided him with sweaty elements at every turn. But don't worry, he is there just to recover the body numbers at the end. <br /> <br /> Williams and Scoggins, to be honest, do little in the film. They just barely stay, let alone act. And, as I said before, Jeff makes a first trip to the showers, so his craze is not allowed to illuminate much of the film. Max does his best, as do a couple of other cast members, but the film is simply terribly atrocious, to be honest. <br /> <br /> The one and only imaginative idea halfway through this film is the naming convention of the ship. They all have the name of musicians: Holly, Presley, Joplin. The rest of the film is tasteless and uninspired. <br /> <br /> Made in 1992, I thought, at the first vision, that it was one of those 80s of straight-to-video work. Apparently they still made shitty movies in the 90s, apparently. <br /> <br /> It is best to avoid. Even as a movie of beer and chips this movie is a stinker, but at least you can make it fast, I suppose.
