Plot = Melissa is a new girl in town, she is fifteen and her birthday will come in a week. Since Melissa is beautiful, every guy in the city wants to connect with her, but the few who manage to capture his interest die mysteriously. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the real reason I wanted to see this movie is because Friday's Dana Kimmel. There was the 13th pt 3 which is not a good reason to run out and watch a movie. When I started watching it I realized that "Sweet Sixteen" is not a very good slasher, it is really boring and boring and it is not going anywhere. After over an hour, there were only three murders and the story has not yet developed in any way possible. <br /> <br /> The film is well shot with good photography and good direction but just like with many other slasher films of the 1980s, the film suffers from being too dark sometimes. However, acting is pretty good and Melissa's character is easy to understand, even if she's a real whore. <br /> <br /> The plot is not completely rubbish, but it is simply too boring to keep you interested, the only thing that made me interested was Melissa who was splendid and Dana Kimmel who is really sweet and pretty in this film. <br /> <br /> All in all a bit boring and fast which is not going anywhere I recommend it to Slasher fans.
