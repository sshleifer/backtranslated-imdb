Jason Lee's pods are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. Otherwise, better go ahead ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clich√©s galore, some scenes scarcely shot but a bit exotic (used JKD) and a lot of bad acting and economic effects. Poor Lee seems to be suffering throughout the film, and it's no wonder. It is not a pleasant comeback. <br /> <br /> The film didn't even cut it like a B series movie - sure, there was a German bleached Rutger-bad villain, but no free sex scene or even just a booty shots. None. ZIP. Nada. Also in Starship Troopers 2 they had the sense to include the mandatory nudity scenes (as for the rest of my comments on that excellent piece of classical cinematic excellence, please refer to our next review on that amazing sequel ...). I had the feeling that the writer was taking revenge on someone with this, so I won't go into the "plot" of the film or anything else related. Except that he had some non-heterosexual tones, so "I said". <br /> <br /> However, this film has something going on - no Jean-Claude :)
