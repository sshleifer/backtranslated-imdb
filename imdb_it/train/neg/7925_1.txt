Do you want an excellent recipe for failure? Take a s y plot, add some weak and completely underdeveloped characters and throw the worst special effects a horror movie has ever known. Let it soak for a week (the amount of time you probably spent on making this basket). The result is Corpse Grinders, a film that brings bad movies to dangerous and exotic locations. <br /> <br /> The film has literally exploded. My words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and tease. This is not the 9th floor from Outer Space. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realize that people actually take time out of their lives to act in this shit, if you can call it acting. But again, when you have bad direction, poor storywriting, all that is poor, acting is the last thing to criticize. <br /> <br /> This film is like a huge and disgusting asshole that you long for from existence, fearing that a friend or loved one could see it somehow. In fact, I could somehow destroy every copy of this film, so as not to pollute the minds of aspiring directors. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me a new respect for every movie I've ever seen. You showed me what is really horrible and why I should appreciate all those movies that are simply boring or boring.
