As a physics student, I became aware of many idiotic professors and other so-called experts in the field. As I continue with my studies, I learn more and more about the actual physics experiments underway and the people who are doing things right. <br /> <br /> So, my friends tell me about this "physics movie" I want to see. Not knowing anything about it, I'm excited, hoping that the information is presented well. <br /> <br /> I did REAL quantum mechanics; it wasn't this. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the basic assumption that everything that happens to a subatomic particle can, and will happen, if you only open your eyes. Let's think about it for a moment. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are composed of about 10 ^ 30 subatomic particles. This is a million billion billion billions of particles! The more "mysterious" quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50% chance of canceling each other out. As more particles are added to the mix, it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result. To tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption, without any justification behind it ... it is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> My friend, even in physics, and I counted 3 facts during the course of this film. But they were presented in the most misleading way I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't say the same for the neural part of the film, since I didn't have any medical training. It seemed like he could have a little more truth, remembering my days in biology, but I can't say. <br /> <br /> At least this film had a positive quality: the dancing peptides (or anything else actually) scene. Not to ruin the priceless plot that drives this film, but the main character goes to a wedding, where he sees all the different types of personalities "pushed" by their peptides *, and then the film cuts on the dance floor, where we are united between people dancing, sometimes surrounded by CG peptides, and a completely CG scene, full of dancing peptides. The film, at that point, was trying to tell us how "emotion-dependent" we are, so we're treated to the complete song of that big hit, "Addicted to Love." <br /> <br /> This scene was redeeming, so that anyone could pass through that scene, and still take this movie seriously ... well, you are the one who needs to "open your eyes".
