A young American woman visits her Irish roots and rejects a druid witch who is out to possess her. It sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it would go. The film seems to be dithering in two directions: are we observing the travails of the Irish-American woman who is fighting her problem with alcohol or are we watching a horror film directed at an evil witch who returns from the past? The director doesn't seem to decide. The two don't seem to gel and in the end you don't get anywhere. This could be done much better and the story seemed to drag towards the end. This was very boring and disappointing.
