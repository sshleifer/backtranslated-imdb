SciFi has had the misfortune of making quality films lately (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel should be based on the great epic Beowulf, however, he deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that television advertisements could have titled him "a shitty film by Christopher Lambert". I did not expect it to be as accurate as a full-fledged Hollywood production, but I still expected that "artistic integrity" would not interfere with the actual story (even if it had changed a bit to scroll a two-hour storyboard well in the assigned time slots). <br /> <br /> The director and the producers had some ideas about what they were doing (were there any research on this?). Obviously not, as can be seen from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (except the mulleto) wear. One of the main problems I had was with Grendel's gaze, if Beowulf should have fought with him, shouldn't he not have been six feet tall and weighed 2 tons? Even the segment of Grendel's death was lacking in every sense ?? in my opinion, that in the epic was actually better than the stuff invented on the script; for example: Grendel should have his arm torn from Beowulf's grip ?? not cut on the forearm after it has been set on fire by an arrow that explodes from a crossbow that seems to weigh 300 pounds! And Grendel's mother, did they just combine it with the dragon at the end of the epic where she eventually dies when she succumbs to her injuries? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic ?? don't do it, as there really isn't one (besides the names of the characters). The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the Druids movie (directed by Jacques Dorfmann) ?? although I don't recommend looking at it either.
