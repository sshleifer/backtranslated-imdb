During the early 1980s, Kurt Thomas was a bit of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position are offered film roles that exist only to capitalize on this. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to make this movie, but I should be paid a lot of money to agree to make a national crazy about myself in a movie. The film is obviously derived from "Enter The Dragon", as well as most martial arts images. Only instead of a true martial art, they invent an absurd new martial art, accurately described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and break dance". A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to save a woman from an impenetrable fortress, yet each room has a support that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant's villains. Of course, he fights against the bad of lead, and of course they have a fantasy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a martial arts movie. There are touches that will appeal to nostalgic types, especially Thomas's mullet hair cuts and many of the male co-stars. But the only reason to watch this movie is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he never set foot on the film set.
