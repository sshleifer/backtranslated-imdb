For several years I have been looking for half-decent films to rent for my children, I have developed a sixth sense to identify really vulgar and video-directed efforts that are really painful to bear (for anyone over eight). I dropped the ball on this and the children spent half the movie wondering "what did he say?" and "why did he do it?" and my eyes hurt to roll them every minute or so while the characters really did a bad job introducing seemingly random plot changes. And the next time someone decides that having absolutely no sword skills is simply "bringing realism" into a movie, please play them with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" it was the head and shoulders above this. Arrgh.
