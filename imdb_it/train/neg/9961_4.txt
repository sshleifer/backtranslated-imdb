Amelia and Michael are a married couple who betray each other. Amelia has a long-time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who doesn't satisfy him. The two smoke with their infidelity, but in the end they manage to connect to each other. <br /> <br /> There isn't much to add to this particular short. The direction is direct and dramatic, which is good, the acting is sincere, but the story leaves something to be desired. Why exactly do we care about these two people? It is a bit difficult to see how this story stands out from any other history of infidelity, except that it is much smaller and does not look for meaning in it (a change of welcoming rhythm if ever). <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's possible that you don't link to these stories because I've never tried them. But I noticed that the block of these narratives is typically the same, that is, a couple talking together avoiding eye contact pretending to be immersed in magazines, etc. The good things about short films are that they provide a little more space to try something different, and I'd like to see a different approach. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
