I've never been to Paris, but after seeing "Paris, Je t'aime" I'm crazy to visit this city! I have been to New York several times and I love the city and its neighborhoods. I expected to be touched by this movie, to feel like jumping into a plane and flying there right away, but, well, I regret the time and money I spent with it. There are no love stories between people or people and cities. There are a lot of meetings and dysfunctional relationships or people who know each other and simply don't work well. Perhaps this reflects a characteristic of the city, where it is said to have thousands of people living alone. Can't find love in New York?
