I thought I saw this movie, twice actually. Then I read all the other reviews, and they weren't quite similar. One man and three young students, two girls and a boy, go to this city to study alleged bigfoot sightings. I still feel pretty sure this is the movie I saw, despite the discrepancies in the reviews. So I report my review: If you like the occasional movie 'B', like I do, then Return to Boggy Creek is the movie for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer and savoring your favorite movie bomb or going out with friends. Boggy Creek, the silent button, and you have a fun night of improvisation. Warning! Is the legend true? I think we could find out, along with a not very stellar cast. Will there be equipment malfunctions at particularly important moments in the film? Does our blond, virile, young hero have chest hair? Will the exceptionally high-tech Technicolor last the entire film? You will have to look to find out for yourself.
