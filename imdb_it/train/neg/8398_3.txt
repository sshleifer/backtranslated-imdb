Schlocky horror movies from the 70s ... you have to love them. In contrast to today's boring puzzles, these special K-tel really do something scary and don't resort to a tired formula. <br /> <br /> This is a B movie about making a B movie ... which went terribly wrong. Faith Domergue (This Island Earth) plays a B over-the-hill movie queen while making a film about a series of gruesome murders that hit a family in their home. Her boyfriend / director, who looks and acts like Gordon Jump with an attitude, is filming on the spot and with a tight schedule. The co-protagonist of the doll Ken discovers a book of Tibetan songs which they insert into the script to add "realism". Unfortunately, "realism" is something they could have done without. <br /> <br /> John Carradine, having long since abandoned the search for the seventeenth gland (The Unearthly), now comes out of a humble existence as a guardian for real estate. He does his daily work, but always seems to be in conflict with the director. <br /> <br /> The horror is built slowly; a dead cat here, John Carradine entering a tomb there, finally culminating in seven, yes, seven murders. (At least there's some truth in the ad.) It's just sad that the ghoul didn't understand that there was a movie above him. How did poor Faith know that those damned Tibetan songs would really work? Admit it, you can't go around pulling Satan's coat up and expecting him to take it down. <br /> <br /> Sterno says to perform an autopsy on The House of Seven Corpses.
