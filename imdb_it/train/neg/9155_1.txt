This film was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for a film class. The brand is totally missing when it comes to the "message" it is trying to convey. The characters are exaggerated, poor acting and for a plot ... well, it's absolutely ridiculous. The cover photo is what made me think it could be a decent movie, the co-actor is beautiful and that's all. Moral of this film: NEVER JUDGE A FILM FROM THE COVER! Save time, money and energy and create your movie at home and you'll be much richer than me. It was painful to watch and frankly it surprises me that someone spends the money to make it and distribute it!
