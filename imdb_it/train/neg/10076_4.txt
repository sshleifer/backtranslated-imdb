The subtle connection between this film and the first Grease is established at the very beginning of the film when Didi Conn, one of the four cast members who repeats the roles, approaches young Maxwell Caulfield, who is a British exchange student. Although in the previous film Olivia Newton, St. John's foreign speech model is not explained, it is explained here that Caulfield is his cousin. What Conn is still doing in school, I guess she likes being around Rydell High even though she's a beautician now. <br /> <br /> Caulfield is a smart guy, so obviously the types of hoods led by Adrian Zmed labeled him as a nerd. And this is especially bad when Zmed's girlfriend decides she likes Caulfield. But being a nerd is not going to cut it. <br /> <br /> That's when Caulfield decides to stage a modern Zorro. He takes a broken bicycle and puts it back together and teaches how to drive. He is wearing a motorcycle suit with a pair of glasses to hide his face. If getting Michelle Pheiffer is not in the cards, Caulfield will have no problem making friends in any gay male leather bar as it was set up. <br /> <br /> Grease 2 introduced Michelle Pheiffer and Maxwell Caulfield and started them both successful career paths they enjoyed. If you've seen the first Grease movie, a much better film, you certainly have an idea of ​​how this film will end. <br /> <br /> In addition to Conn, Eve Arden, Sid Caesar and Dody Goodman, all faculty members from the original return of Grease in their roles. The soundtrack is not as distant as the songs that come from the original. <br /> <br /> It's not that Grease 2 is bad, it's not that great.
