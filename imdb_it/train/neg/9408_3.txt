Watching a videotaped replay of about 8 different Spider-Man cartoons from 1994-1997 made me understand why I couldn't stand it when it came out. <br /> <br /> I come from the old school, where 1967 the Spider-Man cartoon was the best and remains the best. (I won't go into the psychedelic version which is terrible - please give me traditional bad guys.) <br /> <br /> Acting in the new stuff is bad, read a paper without feeling or exaggerating. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best in vocal acting for Spider-man. No one comes close Watching Secret Wars, a great idea for a mini cartoon series, made me jump. Dr. Doom sounds like a comic version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent while Ock is heavy Russian! The old series of heroes from the 1966 Marvel Comics had much better vocal acting. Iron Man sounded like he was wearing an iron mask, Captain America looked authoritative, not like a kid. Paul Frees as Thing in the 1960s was the best thing ever. The old voice actors were pioneers and there will never be anyone like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? In no way can he replicate his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is clumsy. Ok, they have all the fancy shades of the characters and well-painted backgrounds. Sometimes you can say more with less movement if more movements seem ugly. Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements they become robotic. I really don't think any of these animators know what I'm in between. <br /> <br /> Stories are poorly written, and some of the jokes they give to heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when heroes come together for the first time, do they start arguing with each other? In Secret Wars, it was a bad excuse to disagree with them. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - like the Punisher, but because the Thing and the Iron Man can't hold back their feelings to each other is ridiculous, then the Torch unites. This is just another of the later comics trends to make heroes confront each other for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see that stuff. Give them a better reason to fight and maybe they can be pulled off, but "Hey what are you doing here" and "Don't tell me what to do" are LAME reasons. Another poorly written scene is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne unmasks himself to ruin Peter's wedding. The whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - which means no punches. In secret wars, the lizard has carefully hidden the charge of the Thing. But it hits the bad guys through a whole block in the comics. He simply has to go back to lifting heavy things and subdue a villain by grabbing him in cartoons. Of course, these cartoons were not made strictly for us adults but for children under 12 years. That's why they can't have punches, because mom and dad don't believe in that kind of violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons will include that. As a child, before political correctness came into fashion, I saw cartoons beating each other. What's wrong with a punch to the ribs? Is there really less violence in the world today because those clear and clever cartoons brought out their fist? I find this the most offensive of all when I look at new things. They wrote "the punch" because we could all hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Guys, enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 evaluation
