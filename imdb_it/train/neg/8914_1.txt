I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for pretentious cinema viewers) for twenty minutes because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawns, not to mention I was soon close to tears for the $ 3.99 I had wasted to Blockbuster. The acting of Joanna Pacula and her Slavic accent made terribly are terrible enough to put one to gnash her teeth. I knew two hours of her would be two hours too long. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are interpreted by insignificant actors of extraordinarily few talents. While we are on the subject of talent, it seems that Breuer's supercolious assistant was extracted from a local acting troupe. He clearly did not learn his trade. In fact, it's really horrible. All the public scenes seemed to be staged, with the extras mechanically walking in their best of Sunday. Deactivating this film was much more satisfying than turning it on. Don't rent this terrible movie. You will regret having spent your money.
