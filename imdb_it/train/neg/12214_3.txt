Well, what I can say about this movie is that it's nice to see so many Asian faces. What I didn't like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes about what the typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl without too many convictions that she has to play someone else to get ahead, the white boy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave her white world behind for the land of the yellow and "keep true" the black taxi driver. Furthermore, the location of coca cola, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts was a bit too obvious. The plot of the story itself was fun but practically as I thought the story would unravel. Then again when you look at romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again I wanted to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best part of the film.
