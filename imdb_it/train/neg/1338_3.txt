I've seen goals go by ... twice ... and always the same feeling ... see the Olsen twins do the same movie .... they like to play different sports and then fall in love with boys..OK now film .... first of all these kids and girls don't play on such big goals ... 2.football doesn't play on time outs ... 3.if the game is at its end the referee gives overtime (one minute or more) ... and the ending is so expected .... I think this film is bad due to the lack of knowledge of football .... if it was made by European producers it would be better ... and also the actors of mane is not the choice of wright ... they suffer from lack of authentic..OK they played some seasons in full house but this does not make them great stars .... you have to show your talent. ... and this is what is missing in the Olsen twins
