I love Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> And I like 99% of all the movies I see. <br /> <br /> And I came out of this. <br /> <br /> Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of the theater laughing at every little thing ("Oh no, Jamie knocks on the door! HEE HEE HEE! "), But .. it was so incredibly annoying. It was not possible to resume the shooting of the camera, and no photo shooting from a conventional angle ... everything had to be in-your-face, noisy and annoying. <br /> <br /> The bad guy tried to be fluid and Malkovich-like, but at this point, he's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you've seen coming, too many that you've heard before, and too many "robust" lines ... and I don't care about that kind of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, almost all of the supporting cast disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I love Jamie Foxx, and I think it's very funny, and I thought it was funny in this movie ... but not funny enough for me to put up with everything else <br /> <br /> this film needed less shooter, less disturbing camera shots, more emotions, more sensations and more Jamie Foxx. I gave a 2.
