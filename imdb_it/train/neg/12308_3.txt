Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd failed to save this film by laying an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic television series Phil Silvers, it was bombed because: A) It was updated to the 90s, and B) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confused, weak and silly script. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters who played simple but hilarious jokes. Expanding this premise in a film of the 90s was asking for problems, and shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this stink a second time.
