To Die For (1989) was just another d.t.v. feature that made its appearance on cable ad nasuem during the early nineties. The only thing worth noting about this feature was the last film in which Duane Jones appeared. Apart from that, there's no reason to watch this vampire movie unless you like pseudo-chick movies disguised as a horror movie. A tired vampire aspires to love and searches the secondary streets of L.A. Will Vlad succeed or will he strike again as he did for the last century? <br /> <br /> This film must have been great because a couple of sequels are soon followed. They are so bad that they make this look like a classic. I know this is a vampire movie but the directors could get used to the lighting. <br /> <br /> Not recommended by me because I didn't like it. <br /> <br /> 'nuff said?
