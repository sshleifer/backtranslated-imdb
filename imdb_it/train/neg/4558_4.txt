Honestly, I was disappointed with "Expiry". Super smart title and interesting premise, but I don't think it was delivered. What was it? The main character's desire to reconnect with his native roots? Or more likely, it was his need to overcome his fear of death. But he was not created as someone who lived his life with fear - it seems that his life is going well, but since the judgment day is approaching, he should now start to worry. I didn't buy it Meanwhile, the secondary characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that merged into a general story. They were just doing their thing, running parallel to the main character. Furthermore, what was treated as a "curse" seemed more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? In the end, why wasn't he going to stay in his apartment all day for his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I loved the shots in Seattle, the cinematography was beautiful, the acting was good in the times when it wasn't great.
