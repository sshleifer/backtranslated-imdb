I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place, but Baba was a huge disappointment. Between a terrible plot, the action and the songs were just mediocre. The plot becomes very predicatory. Instead of running for an office like NTR or MGR, Rajni almost seemed to be the next great guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife tells me that since this movie was released, Rajni has been making more films! <br /> <br /> We were fortunate initially to have bought Babu (an old man from Sivajiganeshan) online by chance when I was trying to buy this .... it was a great movie, which made up for the fact that I bought this dud ... except that it makes Baba look even worse by comparison! <br /> <br /> Bryan
