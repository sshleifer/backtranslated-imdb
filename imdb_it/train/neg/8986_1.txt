THIS FILM IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to get me to exaggerate on a film, but this film left me at home !! I haven't finished the film yet and I had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. I NEVER DID !! As a consumer, don't spend your money on this movie. Wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something. It's barely TV worthy. I REALLY FEEL LIKE A TRASHING FILM, BUT THIS FILM IS TRASH! Just above the porn. It should have and X rating! Good plot, some frontal nudity (if this floats your boat), but HORRIBLE acting at school level. I don't know how this film received distribution. (It must have been a contractual thing.) Really, if you really like watching good movies, don't waste your time with this. From a movie lover to another. You will be MAD TO YOURSELF! Let me tell you this too, if you have been through something like that maybe you can put yourself in relation and it will have a certain value for you. In that case I say we look at it, you can take something away from it, if not just see something that happened to you being recited by someone else (it has therapeutic value).
