This film is the biggest steaming pile of Sai thing, Being from and raised in Wichita Kansas, I know for sure that 90% of the film was Bogus. Apart from the names of some of the victims, nothing else was correct. It seems that the film was made with dad's handy-cam, He had footage that I believe came from another film along with archive material from a slaughterhouse. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for the sake of it, but because of bad acting, poorly prepared or non-existent sets and a very boring and short ending. It was a struggle to watch it until the end. I recommend you don't waste your money on this movie or you will mind. crunch
