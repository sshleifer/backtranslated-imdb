Ok, I'm not going to criticize this movie in depth. I take note of the many appreciative reviews that preceded me and, since I generally like Maria de Medeiros, I have been hesitant to make a disparaging comment - and in this way almost a year has passed. But every time I see that DVD on my shelf, I hear an inner groan. However, let the laudatory voices prevail over me! But for other film buffs like me - attention. <br /> <br /> Expressed in simpler and kinder terms, here is my position: <br /> <br /> The political unrest and the reversal that form the backdrop to this film also served as a background for a certain period of my life - through the newspapers I read every day in my local Central European pub. At that time, I followed the news, but I never fully understood what was happening. Journalists tended to report either in non-partisan terms, or with conservatism that disapproved of groups that disturbed peace or fomented rebellion against the establishment. These were times when other winds of turmoil swirled through Paris, Berlin, Prague and various places in the United States, whose problems I clearly understand at the time - but dictatorship or not, my papers tended to treat the government of Portugal simply as the establishment - not as a well thought-out "evil empire" to use flippant Star War terms. <br /> <br /> So, week after week, I read about the disturbances, but I never found an intelligent editorial that could provide the story behind them, or evaluate the socio-economic practices and impacts of the dictatorship, etc. . <br /> <br /> So, in buying this film, I had at least two hopes: finally understanding the details that led to social disorder and enjoying a well-conceived drama. This movie didn't even give me. <br /> <br /> The film assumes that viewers already have broad knowledge and deep emotions about historical facts. And the drama - well, as I said, I want to encourage Maria de Medeiros and the Portuguese film industry, but - it was trivial and superficial. <br /> <br /> I got my copy of the DVD from France - "Cannes 2000 Official Selection - Un Certain Regard". The box shows smiling, clean-shaven actors, the lead that gives the sign of victory in a way that reminds me more of the Playboy bunny. After seeing the work, I wondered what the French might have thought - although as a superficial piece of "cinema verite" "with sensitive ethnic content, I can understand their natural inclination to praise it for its" honesty "but. .. <br /> <br /> Look at the back of the box: "A regard chaleuruex sur la Revolution" - a warm greeting? Try to describe the overthrow and murder of Allende with a "warm regard"! Try it with the Czechoslovakia in 1968! Try it with the whole host of civilian overthrows and rebellions! <br /> <br /> Another review: Maria de Medeiros a renoue 'with pay son, son enfance et son histoire. "Garbage, garbage, garbage! I love Portugal, all over Europe, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague are my favorite cities, but my love for a city and a country is not a vacuous film. I cling to my old VHS tapes of Capas Negras and A Cancao de Lisboa - in the meantime, I'm stuck with a zone 2 from the above title that could even go in the trash.
