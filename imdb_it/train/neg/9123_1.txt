I don't have much to say about this movie. It may have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it's one of the most tragic failures in film history. Sellers' final film makes it even more painful. <br /> <br /> The terrible script, the direction and the incredible wooden performances all come together terribly to make this film one of the most incredibly horrible ever made. <Br /> <br /> I would love it if I could even find a chuckle or a little laugh buried somewhere in this pile of putrefied fat, but it's a disaster without life and without humor. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why didn't you stop to BE THERE?
