Anyone who has studied physics or cognitive science will come out disgusted after 40 minutes, like my wife and I did. The ignorant masses could be entertained by the arguments of renunciation of the hand and by the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even an attempt of a logical reason) by the true science. I am offended by these absurdities presented in the guise of "science". I can only conclude that the writers took a book on quantum physics, they didn't understand anything, then they saw The Matrix about a thousand times, and continued to write this film. <br /> <br /> For example, the Washington DC criminal experiment was done by the transcendental meditation program. A brief research will reveal the science of their methods. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> Save your money.
