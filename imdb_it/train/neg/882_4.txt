There's a reason why she went directly to the video - the story is gorgeous, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a squalid way - sex in churches, and other scenes that border on tastelessness (like the scene in the laundry) contaminate this film. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is ok - but the film itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are not well done. But it's a good movie for curiosity contests, because so few people have seen it.
