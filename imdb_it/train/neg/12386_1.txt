It is difficult to express an impartial judgment on a film like this that has had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is without doubt the worst kind of exploitative film. I was unlucky enough to see this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. I saw him again earlier this year and I was horrified again. <br /> <br /> I am not a zealot or one who says what others should and should not see, but I was very offended by the way something as horrible as rape was addressed in this film. I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain ugly. Instead, rent a little Rus Myer.
