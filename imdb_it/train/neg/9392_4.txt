... and also Ethel Merman fans will love his loud and overbearing voice like the evil witch Mombi, but this cartoon sequel to "The Wizard Of Oz" lacks real imagination, replacing fantasy and excitement with noisy (and economically repeating his shoots like a bad music video). Little Dorothy is brought back to Oz, who has gone broke, and meets old and new friends. The elegant animation is stuck somewhere between the weakest Walt Disney and the less inspired shows of Hanna-Barbera, however many of the songs are good, in particular the sweet lament of Dorothy "It's a Far Away Land", superbly played by Liza Minnelli. You can count on Minnelli for energy, which is why the film gets back up every time Dorothy is around. Much of this is not memorable, and I'm not even sure that baby boomers will have a charge since it has been out of circulation for so long. As an object of curiosity, simply right. ** from ****
