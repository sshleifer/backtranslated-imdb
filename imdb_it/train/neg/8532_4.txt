The singer-songwriter Robert Taylor (in the role of Terry) is "dizzy, slap-happy" and cannot see directly beyond the normal Norma Shearer (as Consuelo). "It makes the sun shining, even when it rains," explains Taylor. But, Mr. Taylor has a lump in his throat every time he approaches Mrs. Shearer. Finally, at the Palm Beach casino, Shearer attends, Taylor proclaims "I love you!" Shearer wipes him out while engaged to George Sanders (like Tony). However, to settle a gambling debt, Shearer hires Taylor to pose as "Her Cardboard Lover", to make Mr. Sanders jealous. <br /> <br /> The title of this film invites the obvious and appropriate review in three words: "You Cardboard Film". The most remarkable thing is Shearer's latest film appearance, one of the biggest stars in the world from "He Who Gets Slapped" (1924, who plays another Consuelo) to "The Women" (1939). To be honest, this was probably the kind of Shearer film that MGM believed the public wanted to see. However, the part is not very flattering. <br /> <br /> Plucked and fed, Taylor and Shearer were better at "The Escape" (1940). If Shearer had continued, she would have become a better actress than "protagonist"; apparently she was no longer interested and certainly didn't need money. Taylor has a great scene, starring "When I am Dead, My Dearest" by Christina Rossetti as he threatens to jump off Shearer's balcony, as directed by George Cukor. <br /> <br /> **** Her Cardboard Lover (6/42) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor, George Sanders
