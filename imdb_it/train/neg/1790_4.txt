This was a "cute" movie at first, then it got too corny and contained mediocre songs, at best. <br /> <br /> There is too much King James spoken English is not only annoying in today's world, but not always easy to interpret Can you imagine today's youth trying to listen to this movie? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is as nice as "Hank Martin". Even Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was in addition to her good looks and beautiful long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie with a nice ending, and I can't beat it. Maybe this is worthy of a rent, for historical love or if you're a big fan of Crosby but, overall, it's not so much.
