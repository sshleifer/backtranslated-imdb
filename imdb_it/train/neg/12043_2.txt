I like Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with intelligence and intelligence, not to mention the face, the pectorals and all the rest. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise" a thought bothered me, who remembers me? "Troy" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obviously obvious. Male, American, etc. But still, Brigitte Bardot comes to mind. It is so beautiful that it is more effective when played against it. "Kalifornia" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only still photographs with Pitt, half-naked in rapid sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of intoxicating fans. Strange, "Das Boot" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing to direct this? Well, I suppose it would be very difficult to say no to the idea of ​​working with the new Brigitte Bardot.
