The concept of a legal gray area in Love Crimes contributes about 10% of the appeal of the film; the other 90% can be attributed to his flagrant malice. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district attorney is of wood is a gross euphemism. With his petty clothes and superfluous hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the public of his devoted hatred for men. Why else would he ask his only friend to be a prostitute just to be able to arrest the cops who tried to take them back? This hatred is also the only reason why he constantly chases a perverted photographer who gives women a consensual thrill and the driving force behind this lousy movie. Watching young people go from frigid nudity to frontal nudity does not do much to arouse interest, but anger angers that it throws up standing near a lake fire. Watching her and complaining about her self-hatred and her sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rent, but it's all downhill to and from there. Despite her desire to bring the character of Patrick Bergin to justice, her police skills completely escape her prey to her tired desire and passion. Patrick Bergin does a fairly dignified job as a sociopathic slimy; if it worked in Sleeping With the Enemy, surely it can work in this. But I can't help but wonder if Young's remarkable lack of energy is in conflict with his viscosity. I imagine he does it and the result is a "thriller" with chills that are completely bad and yet comical.
