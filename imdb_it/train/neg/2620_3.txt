After watching the 1996 remake, I thought it was the most fun way to see Crudelia De Vil get her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was pretty funny and, in my view, better than the animated one. But in reality there was no need for a second. First of all, if Cruela is coming back, don't cure it and make it crazy again. Just get her out of jail and this is a rap. I thought it wasn't very funny. He should have only one original puppy returning. I would have expected him to be Lucky, since he was the most attractive, and also with Roger and Anita. However, they decided to do a complete re-fusion and add not a hundred, not even a hundred and two, but only THREE puppies and a parrot that thinks it is a (smart) dog. Gerard Depardieu's part was useless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too exaggerated to be true. She is cooked in a giant cake. It was a desperate attempt at physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first. This didn't work. He was too over the top and not too funny. I felt really sorry for Cruella.
