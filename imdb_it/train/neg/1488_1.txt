I had to register for IMDb just to post a comment on how horrible this movie is ... my cats and a ball have a better plot than this. It's not the worst acting I've ever seen, but when you delete almost the entire cast of the movie within 5 minutes, it leaves something to be desired. There was not a single moment of "fear" in the film, except when they watched the movie "Halloween" on TV. All around, it seems that it could have been a good story, pulling the credits and saying that Chasey Lain was in it was a bit of a loss since I didn't recognize her right away and her scene was already over before I could you said 'oh yes, here it is'. I'm so happy to have seen him in a hotel and not paid him because I would have become a real ticking if I had paid a penny to see him. I normally like or at least manage to find a saving factor in a film, but this is an exception. It's so ugly that it's not even so funny-so-good-is-bad .... it's just ugly.
