I knew this movie wouldn't be great, but I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm a fan of Luke Wilson, so I thought it was a potential. Unfortunately, many of the film's dialogues were very false and flashy. I think Aquafresh gave some money for the production of the film because they were dropping some suggestions. There is a click where the sign of Aquafresh sticks out on you that you can't help but notice. Perhaps they should have focused more on writing and acting than we can sometimes eliminate Aquafresh products in the film without people getting annoyed. The film had its moments, but I'm glad I didn't spend $ 9.50 to see it in the theater.
