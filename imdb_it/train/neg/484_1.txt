I was disgusted with this movie. No, it wasn't for the graphic sex scenes, it's because he ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This film does not contain much truth about her and her art. He shows a work of art he did (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that he was listed as a witness in the rape trial when he didn't paint his first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He stole Artemisia. It wasn't love, it was rape. He did not pretend to accept false accusations of rape to prevent her from suffering while being tortured. According to the rape transcripts, she continued to claim that she had never known Artemisia carnally (alias had sex) while she kept repeating "It's true". <br /> <br /> I encourage all of you to go out and discover the real Artemisia and see what it really is. Don't base all your knowledge on this fictional film. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and some incredible artistic works. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the film, but discover the true story of Artemisia.
