The twist endings can be really cool in a movie. It is particularly interesting when the turning point is right before our eyes, but we simply do not pay attention. Those types of twisting finals are those that make people think. Then we have twists like this movie has. It is striking that, regardless of whether you pay attention, you have no idea what will happen. When they reveal this type of random blow, instead of shock, it is somehow a stunned reaction. This film starts as if it were an interesting horror movie, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogues and a stupid shot. <br /> <br /> Three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree trunk. They end up in the house of a creepy old lady, who hates men, and are greeted by her daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). They happen strangely as these girls stay in this house for several days instead of trying to leave or go home, and the suspense progresses into a stupid fool. <br /> <br /> This film is too involved in its dialogue, and is always among only a few characters. We have the three main girls, the terrifying spinster and the old lady, and the conversation of all importance does not go beyond these five. To make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. It is actually exasperating enough to sit through their conversations. We want to know what's going on, and instead they talk, talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> The holes in the plot are abundant here. The house these girls are in when they get into their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere ... wow, three miles! A walk of two hours or less will kill them. Why didn't they walk around with the worker for this family that was driving around town? Did he have a single-seater? Why are these girls never questioning their departure and willingly, rarely even controlling themselves? Why did this have to have so many stupid turns? Perhaps the answers are in the boring script. <br /> <br /> Having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. It's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but no doubt stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 on ****. 79 minutes R for nudity and violence.
