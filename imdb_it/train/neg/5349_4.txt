This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Moranis' career. As is the Disney tradition, quality is sacrificed in the name of rapid collection; this is a lazy rebuilt with Moranis who accidentally shrinks and some relatives so he can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. The instantaneously dated visual effects and the poor dialogue abound in this cheese knife, which has done nothing but make me rock myself for the days of "The Incredible Shrinking Man", when this sort of thing was done correctly. Incredibly, this is directed by the best cinematographer Dean Cundey, who should stick to the day's work or choose better material next time.
