The mission of Assassin Hauser (John Cusak) is to hit a Middle East oil minister, whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan, run by American interests. Hauser presents himself as a Trade Show producer to allow him to get to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes more annoying. Here he does too much: government, politics, music, war, people are not generally accepted by society and I mentioned "war". And that's what we have here - a more annoying film that borders on a bad nightmare brought to life. I'm still wondering why I continued with the DVD. Also, are there so many members of the Cusak family in this that John Cusak appears embarrassed by the family that is there, or is it just me? <br /> <br /> It was a John Cusak film, while a bit unusual in the end was quite good. Not here. You believe that John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Do what you want. <br /> <br /> In the film is there too much stuff accompanied by continuous shootings, bombings and shouts that you really can't focus or was that the point? Probably. It takes too long to set up the shot, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime we have jokes without sense among all in the cast. And the chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: the boy ?? what girl ???? and they needed something to take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, for what they must have been, (unusual and annoying) the performances of Duff, and Kingsley were good. But when I saw the character of Dan Aykroyd at the start of the show, sitting on a toilet and making a dump, I knew that the rest of the show would also go to the tank. I was not wrong. I'm sure some will sing the praises of this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name, then it's a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow level and save itself. Never done. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
