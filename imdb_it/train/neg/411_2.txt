Normally I don't feel very encouraged to comment on films I don't like, but in a case like this, I just have to say something. This film is terrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many flaws in the narrative that I don't even feel compelled to elaborate because it's time for me to move on from this experience. The most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the reasons for Bacon's character madness are due to a power attack or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> Given the special the effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven did some good things (the cut of the director of Robocop on DVD is fantastic). However, this film is stupid and generally does not come close to explaining the point or the technical aspect of the subject, and instead is content with a predictable action without any enjoyment. <br /> <br /> In short, like many other reviews here to say (I wish I had read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
