Steven Seagal seems to be sleepwalking through a terrible film shot almost entirely in the foreground to mask the complete lack of budget and resources. Exploiting technical defects - silver F / A-18 and F-14 taken from an aircraft carrier for an air strike and miraculously becoming F-16 disguised for the actual strike - would give this film more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing about the film is the credits that vanish and disappear in a flash, which is presumably available to all Final Cut Pro users. Putting all your creativity in your credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
