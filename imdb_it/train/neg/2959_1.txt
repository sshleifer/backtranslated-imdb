No matter what someone tells you, there is a simple fact in the word "possession" in cinema circles - how "what caused you to highlight this film?" Religion has nothing to do with it, but common sense does. That is, if your mind is clear and you have a healthy mind to make a judgment. <br /> <br /> On many levels I have tried to rationalize where this film could entertain ... or even interest the average consumer. The star? History? The unique idea? A friendly film that children would love with a dinosaur and a black woman? On, my God! I'm sure that when this was an "idea", it sounded good. But somewhere during the course of development ... someone should have indicated where the idea could not result in a piece of entertainment that anyone would want to see or pay ... unless they were very deeply under the influence of alcohol or drugs and I saw something that the rest of us could not see. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this is a complete mess. Mess, mess - sin and a mess. <br /> <br /> Who cares about the plot (what plot?) Et al. Whoopie received a salary, but I would have been embarrassed to take it. I really hope he fired his agent / manager / publicist for this career move. Obviously not, he continued to make other bad films. And other bad movies. Sad.
