I'm amazed with some reviews of this film. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is terrible. The plot is extremely lazy. It's not even scary. The people out there who think that because Sarah Michelle Geller is on stage is somehow like The Grudge should forget about it. This film is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slow than that. I was extremely disappointed with this movie. It didn't frighten me or interest me. Let's face it, this type of plot was flogged to death at this stage, e.g. the dead try to contact the living - Dragonfly, What Lies Beneath, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones to write original horror films today are the Japanese and the Koreans. Movies that are coming out of Hollywood, like this one, are cynical money-making exercises without a shred of respect for the viewer. They've just been baked
