A tramp gives a secret soldier a tip about a secret service man in presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Nonsense. How did the tramp know? The script then turns into a more detailed examination of how the secret service works, but who cares. Most of this slows down the film. All the following chases are the version of this film of the tiring car chases of many films. Then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero surpasses and wipes out all his friends, we have a shooting in the Toronto City Hall. Canadians are clearly marked with maple leaves, but how did they get into this? In the end, everything is solved. But it still doesn't make sense.
