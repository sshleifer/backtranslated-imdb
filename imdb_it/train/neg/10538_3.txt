The First Power (1990) was a terrible film released during the late 1980s / early 1990s of inexpensive horror films. I found this film very boring but extremely fun in some parts. This film lacks so much sense and credibility that it's not even funny. The rapid justice system in this film makes Texas weak by comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is above his head with this role (he plays a hard cop) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's most attractive sister) plays a psychic. Don't waste time with this because it's bad. What a minute, I take it back. This film is a great party movie. Take a look at the sister of the serramanico, has the most beautiful legs I've ever seen on a nun who wasn't in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation movie. Hey! <br /> <br /> This marked the end of an era for L.D.P. His star was blurred and he was unable to attract flies to a dunghill. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurrection" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
