You can give JMS and kids a pass for this because they were at the beginning of their series and on a limited budget, but the film is still under par. Don't get me wrong, the B5 series is by far the best TV series ever, but if I were an exec to see this movie, I wouldn't have ordered the series. I don't like O'Hare as an actor, the costumes are stupid and there are tons of clich√©s. The same can be said for most of the first season (with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors); Bruce immediately set fire to the series and continued to be an incredible show. If you are a B5 fan and have not seen this movie, watch it. If you're not a B5 fan, you don't ... don't want to watch the series.
