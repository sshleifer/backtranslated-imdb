Well, it's 90 minutes of my life, I'm not coming back. This film makes the television series "California Dreams" as "Almost Famous". The acting was horrible and the plot was not realistic. Don't even get me started on the current frontline band in this story, limp songs, watch etc. You had to believe that they were one of the hottest bands in the country, and there is not enough irony in the world to accept that. The guitarist is considered a heroin addict, not that I blame him, if I were in a band so rotten with stale songs and wooden acting, I would have injected the horse too. <br /> <br /> If you take music remotely, avoid it at all costs.
