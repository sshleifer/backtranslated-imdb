Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a National Lampoon's Madness film: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is poor, even by typical Lampoon standards. 2. It's not fun. 3. No one goes to see a movie. <br /> <br /> So after I finished watching it, I started wondering why it's called "National Lampoon goes to the cinema" and why it was conceived, much less actually done. It would be like calling "An American boy goes to the movies" by Austin Powers. What lame. He is not American and does not go to the movies. None of the characters in the so-called 'satire' of Lampoon is fun, and nobody goes to see movies, which causes some problems. I had hoped it was something in the wake of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it's not. <br /> <br /> This was the first National Lampoon movie after Animal House, although it could not be said from the quality of the film. Poorly developed, rough and amateur by any standard, does it induce headaches ?? it's not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems twice the length. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. The really bad films are generally renamed ?? and this little disaster falls into that category. It has two separate titles - probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning received by home video critics was in 1982/83. 'Hmm, Movie Madness ?? I've never heard of this movie before! Affittiamolo! "And then, the realization:" Hey, wait a minute, this is only National Lampoon goes to the cinema! " <br /> <br /> It has been set aside by MGM / UA, for never having been released in cinemas or DVDs; occasionally he appears on television a couple of times every ten years, which is the only place where you can find him. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three stories? a parody of self-magnification videos, butter and the corporate ruthlessness and police brutality of the police / film (I guess). The first segment sees Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated boy who divorces his wife and does other things. I'm not sure what, because it was so boring that my mind started to wander. Until the appearance of the sex scene. <br /> <br /> Part II tells of an exotic dancer raped by a piece of butter (don't ask) who decides to become the queen of margarine so that she can stop supplying dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the movie: "Only I can make love with my son!" If you think it's not very funny, are you right ?? it is not. And imagine ?? it's the highlight of this movie! <br /> <br /> Part III is about a policeman chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) just to lose his head and shoot the guy. It contains a funny scene but is extremely over-performed ?? only Lloyd really shows humor, interpreting his dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal character. The part where he is suffocating his victim and the mild policeman is watching as everything unfolds, at least, evokes a laugh or two. It's a shame to see a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards. Do the writers of each segment clearly believe that the so-called stereotypes are very ironic and intelligent? the fault is that the film becomes a huge contradiction, favoring the T & A standard instead of the plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It is easy to see that none of the actors has been fascinated by the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed that they rarely manage to make visual contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The film is not funny, as I said before. I laughed once, in one line, and even then it was half lazy. Two laughs, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a series of other decent comedies look like traces of normal laughter. I like National Lampoon's Vacation series (or at least three of four episodes) and their classic Animal House, but their recent direct-to-video bomb shots like Golf Punks (with that great comic genius Tom Arnold) set a good example why their magazine went out of print more than ten years ago. Get really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> Sad to see a new movie, called Gold Diggers, it was released with their "stamp of approval". Is it like condemning a film even before it arrives in theaters? maybe they should start not to advertise their name everywhere ?? <br /> <br /> Distributor: "This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon approval stamp. This will teach you not to do something so terrible next time." Forget the death penalty. Just put a bunch of criminals in a room and show them over and over again every day for a month. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that I can't even begin to explain its rotten cowardice. I give up.
