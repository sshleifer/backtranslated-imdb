I saw the trailer for this movie and it was great, so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, acting is a mess, special effects (if you can call them that), look like something that wouldn't be out of place in a school play. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie that you'll be ashamed as soon as they appear on the screen, which unfortunately is all too often. For a story, forget it. This is a warning, not wasting money on this film must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If, for some reason, you like this movie, look at Troll 2, you'll probably like it too.
