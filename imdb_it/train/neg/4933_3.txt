This film is not so bad compared to the first two sequels of the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser of the 13th prize on Friday. The acting is really bad, but the gore and the special effects make it interesting. This is something I like about Screaming Mad George (the make up effects artist for the film), its effects are so offensive and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy they are. The film is not so gory, but there is a scene of very delicate eyeball munching in the middle involving a toy larva (that!?!) Mickey Rooney makes a guest appearance that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic but needed the money in that moment, maybe? If you liked the fourth weirdo installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than the Matrix! To enjoy.
