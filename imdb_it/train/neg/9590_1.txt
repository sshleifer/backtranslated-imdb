The film is based on an authentic 1950s novel. Journalist Colin McInnes has written a series of three "London novels": "Absolute Beginners", "City of Spades" and "Mr Love and Justice". I read all three. The first two are excellent. The last, perhaps an experiment that didn't come out. But McInnes's work is highly acclaimed; and rightly so. This musical is the novelist's definitive nightmare: to see the fruits of one's mind transformed into a sumptuous, misinterpreted and soporific one-dimensional excuse of a film that claims to capture the spirit of 1950s London, and does nothing of the sort. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, Colin McInnes was not alive to witness it.
