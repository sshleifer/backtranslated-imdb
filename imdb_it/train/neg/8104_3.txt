I know, but this film is a great example of how a collection of "depth" signifiers (political turmoil, love / lust) can be combined at random with great critical acclaim (see also "American beauty"). kaufman's film trudges along with free sex scenes interspersed with sequences of often painful dialogues (in one scene I counted three different "generic European" influences influenced by the actors) and the state views could go crazy, but fails to tie them together Kundera consistent meditation offered. and in his long three hours he almost manages to overlook franz, the fourth missing piece in the love triangle in the heart of the plot, and in this way he sacrifices the central mechanism of the novel to show the spectrum of emotions and power relations that they are obtained in love affairs. he also fails to include the time of the token screen for Tomas's son, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points that Kundera was doing in the novel. combined with the fiercest soundtrack, these flaws make the three hours of this film incredibly heavy in tone and light in content.
