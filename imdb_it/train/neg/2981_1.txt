This film was recently released on DVD in the United States and I finally had the opportunity to see this jewel hard to find. He even came with original theater previews of other Italian horror classics like "SPASMO" and "OLTRE LE TENEBRE". Unfortunately, the previews were the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> "ZOMBI 3" in a bizarre way is actually connected to the notorious "ZOMBIE" franchise by Lucio Fulci started in 1979. Like ZOMBIE "," ZOMBI 3 "consists of a worn-out plot and a handful of extremely bad actors who barely keep the garbage of this "horror". The gore is almost non-existent (unless you are afraid of people running around with green moss on their faces) and the English dubbing is a notch under embarrassing. <br /> <br /> The plot this time involves a sort of secret military operation with a bunch of incapable scientists (ie an idiot male and his stupid female side kick) who are developing a kind of chemical called "Death One" which should revive the dead Unless my ears should be checked, I don't even remember a REASON for the search for "Death One." It seems EXISTS only to devastate the poor souls who made the mistake of choose to 'star' in this cinematic laugh. <br /> <br /> However, "Death One" is tested on a corpse (which I swear looked like Yul Brynner), and after it was injected into his system, he sits upright and his head explodes! The sound effects are also a lot of fun - since the face of the corpse boils with green slime, you can hear the "crumpled paper" sound. The "Death One" toxin is transported outside and is "hi-jacked" by a group of thieves in which one does it off, but gets infected after cutting on an exposed vial. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the boy turns into a zombie, but not before he manages to escape to a cheap motel, he infects a humble porter and kills a maid by pushing his face into a bathroom mirror (!) . The military takes advantage of it and acts immediately before "eliminating" all those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves inside the "contamination zone" and turn the motel upside down. They find the thief infected and burn his body, just to make the smoke infect a flock of birds flying over the chimney (!). <br /> <br /> We'll cut the introduction of a group of men who are on leave from the army, listening to "groovy music" coming out of a small and bold cabin while dragging a trailer of slutty girls leaning over from the windows and show the chest. Can anyone say "zombie food"? We also have a secondary plot that involves a girl and her boyfriend driving a car that stops to inspect a group of birds lying on the road ... the same birds that have been infected by the smoke of the "zombies"! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boyfriend and the girl goes to a deserted gas station to look for water. This is one of the most incredibly fun moments in the movie. Walk around this old dirty, rusty and obviously abandoned building, where he continues to ask aloud: "HEALTHY? ARE THERE ALL EVERYTHING? PLEASE, I ALREADY NEED SOME WATER!" He meets a group of zombies, one of which is chained to a wall (!) And the other is swinging a machete. After a few rumbles and rolling on the ground, he escapes but not before blowing up the gas station with his lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the birds attack the trailer of prostitutes and a girl is caught and infected. They all stop at the same motel where the original infection took place, and this is where the second funniest moment in the film takes place. After a matter of hours (at most one day), the same motel is now covered in dust, the vines are growing everywhere and it seems to have been abandoned for years. However, what better place to take refuge than this particular building? Needless to say, the group begins to collapse as several people move away together to get stuck in an incredibly stupid situation involving a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> The third most exhilarating moment concerns a man and a woman who explores a deserted village, of which the woman comments: "THIS SITE IS A DUMP!" Then he proceeds to get "pushed" from a balcony by a zombie in the infected water of pirahna (?) Where he has his legs bitten and turns into a zombie in a few seconds! Meanwhile, her friend back at the motel who caught and infected NOW before is still turned into a zombie! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are too many inconsistencies in this film that makes this movie too stupid for words. For example, the percentage of time that infected people are "zombies" differs greatly. Sometimes it takes seconds, other times it takes hours. Some zombies run, others drag their feet and walk very slowly. Some even make kung-fu moves, while others hide under stacks of hay to surprise people. Some of the zombies even speak! The funniest moment, of course, is the infamous "zombie head in the fridge" that "rises" in mid-air and "attacks" a fool who goes in search of food. Strangely, his girlfriend gets her throat torn off by her 'headless' counterpart (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of story lines involving people who are actually killed by zombies. We can never see them come back as zombies, in fact the only ones we see 'zombified' are those caught by the birds and the only girl who makes them bite their legs. Besides that, I expected at least that the couple who had been killed in the kitchen and / or the guy who had been killed on the bridge came back as zombies. It is also surprising that these zombies take only a few bites and then pass on to their next victim. <br /> <br /> The funniest moment was obviously the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who has been infected is on a hospital bed. A woman who seems to have a lot of "medical knowledge" tries to free the child (!) And her face is pulled out by a zombie, before getting her head pushed into the woman's stomach where a hand bursts and proceeds to tear the rest of his face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are perfect stereotypes of this kind. The megalomaniac military officer, the pathetic women who scream in vain and who scream to be killed, the obvious characters that are going to be killed (ie looking at the man who chases a chicken!) I guess this movie is really a comedy. There have been many ridiculous scenes, such as the shed that is blown up with a hand grenade (obviously the scene where the entire budget was spent) and a climate scene in which a man shouts: "I AM THE SET. ... ASSISTANT FOR YOUR BLOOD! ". The costumes are really bad - the same zombies reappear during the course of the film, wearing the same "Asian" clothes that can be found in a Bruce Lee movie, and watch out for the 60s blue skirt the motel girl is wearing when she and his boyfriend meet the infected man. <br /> <br /> The end of the film leaves the door open as usual for the apocalyptic plot. A radio DJ who tells the whole story turns out to be a zombie and warns his listeners of the "beginning of the end" while the two survivors take off in a helicopter. Hardly "DAWN OF THE DEAD" material if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Regardless, this film offers a lot of laughs. The gore is minimal, and what there is of blood is very unconvincing, if not devoid of imagination. The usual mix of black blood, thick green goo that oozed tears sores and 'zombie trick' made up of green moss. "ZOMBI 3" is a good rental for a dormant party or a night of beer and popcorn. In addition to this, horror fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
