Back in 1967, a certain director had no idea of ​​a galaxy, far or near. He was trying to complete a film with the THX title, etc. This brief is a reconstructed story of a certain George. I'm sorry you only have cuteness to defend it. This is just an advertising promo for the director, the actors, et. to the. It has little intrinsic artistic value. It's a brochure. George's protagonist is excellent, as is the character of Leia and the character of Darth. Everything else is simple commercial waste. What a waste. Anyway, he did the job, I guess. The rest of the film is simply treading water to kill time, I guess. just a brochure.
