Vampires Vs. Zombies was not the original title. It was actually ... <br /> <br /> Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Obtained from Cars: Special Guest appearances of Bob the Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and his dog, Random Woman with special powers and the Catholic School Girl's miniskirt zombie choir. <br /> <br /> Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot - only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I love zombies. Hell, I also like lesbians. This film has combined all three things with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) storyline, a horrendous dialogue (I mean REALLY BAD) and casual STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or not ... not 'let me know what was happening in the world). Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal zombies in latex gloves (yes, the directors were so cheap they couldn't even cover the hands of the zombies with oatmeal and paint). However, the result was this terribly bad film, if you could even call it that. <br /> <br /> Would the end make no sense? Was the vampire really a nurse and was the other girl really mentally ill? Where were the Vampires vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the Vampires ... you couldn't really call any of the girls' vampires. Everything. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or buy this movie. If you're REALLY curious ... ok, I'll understand. Seriously, even BAD movie lovers won't be able to stand this. It should be the number 1 on the bottom 100.
