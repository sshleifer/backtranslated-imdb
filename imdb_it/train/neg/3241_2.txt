This film had potential, but what makes it really negative is the acting of Lindsay Crouse. I've never seen it before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there who like them in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Its delivery is robotic. When he uttered his lines he seemed to be trying to make sure he had the right lines and was simply reading the list in his head. So his voice has a very small inflection. I can't believe that someone so bad at acting has been given a starring role in a movie. You must know someone in the world. <br /> <br /> Now I hate being so bad with her, but the comment must be "long" and her performance is what stands out more than anything else. br /> <br /> However, I liked the place where the story was going, so I kept watching it. The first part of the script has the characteristics of a good movie. But the end was disappointing too. Maybe if his acting had been better, I would have liked it.
