WWF Survivor Series 2001 <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest flaw was the fact that he didn't follow most of Survivor's previous series. There was only ONE game in the series of survivors. And that Survivor series game went on for 45 minutes. Also, anyone with a functioning brain would know he was going to end up with The Rock versus Austin and The Rock prevailing for his team. And don't let me start on the preview before the event. No matter who won it it was obvious that no one would die. There was no need for all that unnecessary clamor. Whatever the plot, it was just a wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And as for the rest of the games: the first game was Christian's defending the European title against Al Snow. It was a good quick game and it's nice to see a heel win a game enough. William Regal against Tajiri was boring and we saw it 2 or 3 times before. Edge against Test was good but nothing exceptional. The title steel cage match tag was the best match of the evening. The real battle went on for 10 minutes and nobody really cared who won first. The women's title match wasn't great. No, not in the slightest. The main event was to be the most hypocritical game in history. The Alliance has lost, but guess what, after 5 months every single Alliance superstar is back. The game itself was poor. The Rock eliminated 3 of them and Jericho eliminated 2. The Rock was too busy with his acting to be there when the invasion began. Jericho was the one who compromised the whole game. If I wanted to delete some 2 at the beginning, it would be them. Everyone knew that Kane, Big Show and Undertaker were just fallen boys. 7 games are not enough for a Survivor series. If ever there will ever be a series of survivors like this, I will
