There are many positive things about the new BSG: there are multiple Cylon roles for model 8 and 6, for example, which the two actresses have superbly interpreted. There is the old school feeling of industrial design aboard Galactica ("My ship will not be networked, on my corpse!") Also, all space battles, special effects (even if the expert observer of science fiction will recognize the sympathy of everything) The darkness of the characters, their essentially imperfect nature. <br /> <br /> This makes it even more bitter that the ending was so childish. <br /> <br /> Yes, the first part, the scenes in space, the raid on the Cylons and everything that was very good. But the pasty end? I always watch movies and shows these days with the hidden timer, so I never know how much time remained until the end. So for me it was a special kind of torture, to see the end happen over and over again. Every time I thought, oh this is the final scene, the final shot, I took one more. Every fragile character has had its complete ending! That wasn't really necessary. <br /> <br /> What really brought to light the schoolboy adolescence of all this: the young scenes of Roslin. Why is it important for us to know that: {a} has lost his sisters and father in a horrible accident and {b} who has a night with a former student / student? What leads to history? Where was the connection? Now, I'm all for a more European-style approach, and a random act of anything in movies and shows, and everything else, but this was simply ridiculous. This brought nothing significant to the story. <br /> <br /> Also, I saw the "Last Frakkin special" and in it Ron revealed his lack of cluelessness on the plot: he failed to invent a good ending for the story, so ... not he did it! It's never so much for the characters who made the last episode. The idea "this has been thousands of years in the past", the mythological thing of Eve, has also been used in the Guide to the Hitchhikers to the Galaxy, and believe me, there are many BSG observers who know that particular plot of H2G2. And speaking of Hera, now there is a plot that did NOT work well, EVERYONE. Instead we get that Roslin is doing his former student who is 20 years younger. Don't get me wrong, it's all for older women with younger men. The most power to them. But this ... it just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, (the writing in) this series is as flawed as they wanted its characters to be. This goes even deeper for the last episode. I hope Lost and 24 do better, with their finals in series.
