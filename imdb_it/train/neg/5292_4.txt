I can't recommend this movie as a date movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life on an estate in south-east London is a violent and Beckett account of one of Dante's hell circles, frankly. At the center of it all is Ray Winstone, who has already played this type of character, but never so well. The film opens with him ordering drinks in a pub bar - that's all - and you're already seized by the sense of frustration, self-contempt and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the film. He's a master in acting. <br /> <br /> Obviously the stymied and disinherited need a foil in a drama like this and Winstone is joined by Kathy Burke as his long-lived wife, who absorbs and eventually rejects his unbearable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles is able to shoot like the deadly son of Billy, but sometimes he has to ask himself exactly what he let himself take. Gary Oldman directs the actors closely, maximizing the claustrophobia of their flat, squalid council. 4/10
