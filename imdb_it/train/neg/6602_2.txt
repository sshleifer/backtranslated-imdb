For the life of me I can't understand why someone should make a film like this. The plot is tired, the acting is tense, the language is constantly bogus and sometimes the excessive use of the word "F" seemed a lack of dialogue was prevalent so 'let's throw in another pair of "F" for good measure, that's what that the American public wants to hear ". Gossett was particularly bad and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, rent 'Shrek' and have a good laugh.
