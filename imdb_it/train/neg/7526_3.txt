This is the rate of high quality cheese from the Kung fu movies of the movie B. Bruce "wannabe" Lee is played by Bruce Li ... I think. Of course, we show short videos of Bruce and take a close-up of his eyes and, if he makes the fifth at right angles during the winter solstice, he looks like Bruce. Laugh with awe at how the film splicing is not very good, but some fantastic deleted Enter the Dragon scenes are thrown into the mix. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging from a helicopter. Of course, they think this can excuse Bruce Li for trying to be Bruce even though his character should be Bruce's brother (who for some reason continues to mimic Bruce's gestures and fighting style - very POOR). See Bruce go one on one with the cowardly lion. The props department was stopped by Kay-Bee, see. Even Bruce finds nothing wrong with savagely beating a paralyzed man. Towards the end, the director decided "let's flashback" for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago !! They must have thought that only unicellular organisms with attention deficit disorder could fully understand this film. <br /> <br />
