After reading for many years how good this film was, how Ruiz established himself among French critics (especially the snobby Cahiers crowd), when I finally saw him about a year ago, I found it rather disappointing (but then, I imagine my expectations were skyrocketing). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and merciful, just an hour) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they reflect on a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find out if they contain some clues about a hidden political crime. (The horrible film by Kate Beckinsale Uncovered has a similar topic). Borgesian is a word that I read a lot in the reviews on this film, but I would say that almost all of Borges's stories are more interesting than this film.
