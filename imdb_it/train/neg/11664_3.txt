I really wanted to enjoy this movie. It moved very slowly and was simply boring. If he had been on TV, it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes, maybe. What happened to the story? A large cast and photographer were working on a bad basis. If this is freely based on the life of the director, why didn't he make someone see that the drafting itself was "dissolved". Then he directed it to the rhythm of a snail that may have been the source of some people who fell asleep during the film. The music goes up, but for a different film, not this .... for the saga of soap operas, maybe. There were moments when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl was talking. I was not alone, because I heard some noises about who said what to whom. Why can't Hollywood make better films? This one had the nugget of a great story, but it was just badly executed.
