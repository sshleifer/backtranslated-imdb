Given the title and bizarre art of the box, I was ready for anything. Perhaps my expectation was forced just a little too high, because I was a little dry. <br /> <br /> A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie ends up in a strange house when they get lost in the fog and deciding on the best way to spend the evening is having sex. Where has this set up not already been used? The difference here is the perverse nature of sex. It is not allowed to show all the goods (the groin strokes were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is tarnished) the film tries as hard as possible to show the spectator how sexy sex can be. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all the extravagant adventures, a mud monster (whose origin I can't understand) shows up and starts killing men and raping women ... then killing them too . Some of the attractions are a bit bigger, especially a woman who has gut pulled from her vagina or another woman who spits a mouthful of ... stuff, but otherwise blood is a pretty standard fare. <br /> <br /> In the end the film is shot down by his own projects; it's too over-sexed to be a horror movie and too gruesome to function as a sex movie. Medium can work, but balance is needed. <br /> <br /> 4/10
