"ASTONISHING" shouts the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such an unpleasant piece of shit was ever released. The film revolves around a group of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals and kill innocent people just to survive. Their skin comes off throughout the film, we also see the severed legs, heads etc. Which are as convincing as a Fuzzy Felt Halloween set. There is a lot of talk b * ll ** ks, a bit of human cooking and some strange zombie hunter who imprisons the sufferers of this skin disease in his closet tied to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, cutting them in pieces ... <br /> <br /> You got the picture. Considering that there is no acting talent at all on display, and the blood is ridiculously unrealistic, what's the point of all this petty? Again looking at the videotape, the responsible boy is a "director of underground worship". Would they be like those strange religious sects where they brainwash you to think in a way, when the opposite is true? Because it is the only possible reason why anyone can think of taking pleasure in observing this tax. Then, in the same paragraph, he confronts Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just stupid. Do you like this movie? Are you offended by the opinion above? If so, you must be a member of that sect. Do they have your salaries in your pocket? Do they show you other family members? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson movies until you think it's the best director from A. Hitchcock? Say it ... this sounds like a Panorama special for me. And greet the Los Angeles time critic when you get back to your colony, right? 0/10
