OK, I love bad horror. In particular, I love the ugly horror of teasing. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to tease. Severed was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoiler - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat through the whole movie, and I have a number of comments, both in style "this sucks" is in the realm of real reviews. <br /> <br /> Plot (sort of) - There is a guy in this city (which is perhaps Seattle, see comment below) who is running and cutting heads. He has been doing it for over a year (I'm not going to get exact numbers again - thanks VERY), maybe two or three years. One head a week. And the police are RIGHT NOW calling a "specialist" (who once refers to himself as a psychic, but never comes back). <br /> <br /> Schya, right! The feds take the lead after, what, THREE related murders? After almost ONE HUNDRED OF SIMILAR BONDS we would be under crazy martial law !!!!! <br /> <br /> However, this "specialist" consults the voodoo chick that the police ignored all the time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, which is cutting heads to get enough energy to build a body (and presumably conquer the world - or maybe just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> Um. <br /> <br /> Setting - where is this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you may not realize that at the bar / rave (occupied by a dozen movie staff members and their family members), there is a poster for a local radio station, and that in the fun, esqe dialogues "Pulp Fiction" (as IF) between the two policemen (yes, those who cut their heads for about 15 minutes in the film) discuss "the new stadium" which could have been a problem when the film was made. <br /> <br /> Being from Seattle, I apologize for the role of the film and hang my head in shame. <br /> <br /> OK, that's where it really becomes important - to be a horror writer (unpublished, don't look for my name in IMDb), do research. A lot of research And unlike the writers of this film, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) that guards the cemeteries and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a cheat " Loki "God. <br /> <br /> In other words, it doesn't cut the heads. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, an important part of Voudoun's religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies revolve around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if you've already owned someone, why create a NEW body? <br /> <br />, if Baron Samedi had a body, he did not go around cutting heads, he would get good rum and cigars and par-TAY !!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in reading the Tarot card completely useless (used only to show that the voodoo chick is "spooky") did not ruin the interpretations of the cards as they do most part of the films. Again, I did some research. (Someone remembers the old late-night advertisement for telephone tarot readings - "Lovers - you'll soon fall madly in love ..." and all those nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you did this Through my comments , congratulations. And I'm still sorry. I'll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the movie because of me, so please don't do it.
