Lindsay Anderson was a European filmmaker, while the likes of David Lean, Ridley Scott and Alan Parker make spectacular films that involve the purpose of the visuel. Anderson's film speaks more of social commentaries and subtitles, so much so that often the message ends up taking on the whole film whose primary function should be to entertain the audience <br /> <br /> What you think of IF is reduced what you think of British directors. I am very convinced that cinema must be a universal medium (the best British films are those that try to emulate Hollywood in my opinion), if you want to send a message try pony express, and I find the film dated, pretentious and too fixed in the 60s . 1968 was the summer of love and the year of the student rebellion in France. You can only imagine every single exponent of the French left who adores this film, especially the apex. French filmmakers of the new wave will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but an international audience will not like it, and many will not like it very much
