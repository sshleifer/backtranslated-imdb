This film had an exceptional cast: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - all b-movie actors. But this downer of a movie didn't use any of them for any kind of advantage, with none of their characters even meeting on screen (although Christopher Lee manages to act in front of himself in different scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivations for the aliens in this film seem to change at the drop of a hat. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after getting them the crucial part they need. Then, from nothing, this "peaceful" race decides to destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (even if they offer the protagonist and his wife a place in their society). <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spent watching the man and the wife drive, walk or stand or sit at the desk without doing anything. You would have almost wanted them to be taken away with the rest of the planet at last, only to take revenge on ourselves to death. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like Chris Lee or the low-budget science fiction seventies, I'd give this one a miss. He falls into that narrow celluloid range wasted between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
