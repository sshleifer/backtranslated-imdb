(Honestly, Barbra, I know you are the one who closes all those "NO" on my review. 22 times. How many people did you have to instruct to help you here? You have nothing better to do, how do you look in the mirror all day?) <br /> <br /> Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was "the best movie I saw from the 'Citizen Kane'". This practically says it all - and serves as a terrible warning! <br /> <br /> What are the ingredients for a safe film disaster, and one that will haunt you, never forgetting the tears of both laughter and pain? The ingredients: the face of Barbra Streisand, a musical, feminism, the voice of Barbra Streisand, directed by Barbra Streisand and an ultra-trivial / idiotic premise. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full of egomaniacs, we know that. In fact, almost everyone ?? For definition ?? must be a self-centered in Hollywood. Why would anyone want to act? For "art"?!? Well, if you are stupid enough to believe what they tell you in carefully prepared interviews ?? And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all! This is a nice result. Being surrounded by narcissistic cretins, yet being able to overcome them all? remarkable. <br /> <br /> The film, like all its "soloists", is an egoic journey from hell. Every scene in Streisand is automatically ruined. Dead. But weren't enough, he sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs ?? you know, the kind that allowed Mariah Careys, the Celine Dions and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades. Only for this reason she does not deserve even one but 100 episodes of South Park that make fun of her. <br /> <br /> The premise, Streisand who disguises himself as a man to study to become a rabbi, sounds like a comedy ZAZ. Apart from the fact that it's a clich√©, the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn't look like a woman nor does he look like a man ?? in fact I'm not even sure it's human. The way you look in this movie, well ?? cannot be described in words. E. T. In comparison, he looks like a high school athlete. It looks more alien than Michael Jackson in 2015. It seems HORRIBLE. <br /> <br /> The songs. They made me shiver. Particularly "Dad can you feel like Squeel like a demented female walrus in heat?" and "Tomorrow Night I'll Prepare the Sequel, YENTL 2: THE RETURN OF THE BITCH". Did you know that Streisand was planning to do a morning job in his career, but changed his mind when they told him his voice could change? Can you believe it? You should have done it! Killing two flies with one shot is what it would have been. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals, contact me by e-mail. <br /> <br /> SHOULD THE BARBRA STREISAND FINALLY ENTER THE PENSION? CLICK "YES" OR "NO".
