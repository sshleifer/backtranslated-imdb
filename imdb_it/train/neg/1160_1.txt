This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is (I think) the story of a rebel college basketball player, his tough but honest coach, his girlfriend and a fellow student (played by Michael Margotta) who has constant nervous breakdowns. The plot is not going anywhere, there is no development of the character to zero, there is no one to care about and the performances, with the exception of Bruce Dern as a coach, are terrible. It is hard to believe that a talent like Jack Nicholson can direct such a terrible film. Make sure you avoid this turkey.
