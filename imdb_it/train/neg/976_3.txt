I am generally more open minded than many others, but this was not a good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - I have not seen, and I doubt I will. It has a lot to do with a meandering plot, the lack of chemistry between the protagonists and a ridiculous representation / character from his alleged male protagonist (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon walks on the screen wearing clothes and a hairstyle of a fifteen year old who has been acting for a decade younger than that. He should be a teacher you see, and of course it is well known that school districts around the world like to hire less mature individuals than children who claim to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts that some actor might have made him sympathetic, but old tools like John Cusack or Adam Sandler could have given him a chance. Not Fallon, who is neither funny nor an actor, but seems to think he is both. Not once during the entire course of the film, or do you believe Fallon in his role, or do you think there is a way these two people should or would be together. Towards the end of the film there is a scene in which Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not wear this alone - it is difficult to have a love story of a person) tells Fallon that it is over, it happened too much , and is moving over. And instead of feeling bad for the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you're actively rooting for it - finally doing what it should have done months ago. But obviously the mechanics of the plot won't allow that to be the end (an end that could actually have made a statement from this mess), and instead we see the girl of the rational career throwing everything away to chase this childish idiot and encourage her disappointments. Obviously he wanted to be sticky and satisfying, but in reality it made me feel more disgusted than anything else.
