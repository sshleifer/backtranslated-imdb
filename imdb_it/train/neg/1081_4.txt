There isn't a single nice character in this whole movie. Is the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we should pull? Well, let's see - we find out that he is a sleazebag defense lawyer who takes out criminals on technicalities. He treats his colleagues like cattle, involves them in his personal crisis (in the process, killing one), endangers the safety of his children, threatens his ex-wife's new boyfriend, tries to reinforce the police and school administrators - and all this for what? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD! I was really looking for the father and his band to defeat the lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... he would have made a much more satisfying ending.
