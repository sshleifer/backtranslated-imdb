Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes, she is related to Bruce), the murderer of the first film, has returned to her old tricks. He is one of the counselors of Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at the camp are beautiful and stay away from sex, drugs and blasphemies are fine. But a few steps over the line and Angela kills them, making jokes to the end. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a dirty and obnoxious film, but it had some positive points. This is also vicious and bad, but has no positive points. The plot was done to death and this does NOT add anything to the formula. There are a lot of deadly crimes here (people are burned alive, heads cut off, throats cut) but all the blood is so obviously fake that it becomes really comical. This also has the least number of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there is free female nudity (provided here by Valerie Hartman tremendously lacking talent) and good girl / good team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins, acting is bad, even by slasher movie standards. There is also a cruel advantage in this film where a character is drowned in an annex! Boring and sick with a stupid plot, useless nakedness and bad blood. Salta.
