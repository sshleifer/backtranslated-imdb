I had two reasons to watch this swordsman when he aired yesterday on Danish television. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and I was not disappointed here. It looked beautiful. Secondly, through the reading of the film I had the impression that it was characterized by absurd humor, not unlike that which can be found in the films of Philippe de Broca. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the predictable jokes (apart from a few witty comments on the theme of war) and the completely one-dimensional characters. Furthermore, the action scenes were performed in a strangely mechanical and uninspired way, with no sense of drama. I continued to watch until the end, but I got bored very quickly and sat there waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida.
