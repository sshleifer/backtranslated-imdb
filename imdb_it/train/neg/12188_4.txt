Although I can't deny that his films are often funny, I've always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in a number of films seems to scream "Look at me, am I not an imaginative director?" His best film I've seen is the one with the least added, the superlative "Raging Bull". <br /> <br /> For this remake it seems that it was as usual, however. The dull film to convey a scene from the 1950s was so insignificant as to be a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic "Psycho" soundtrack are more likely to elicit sneers of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The "Psycho" soundtrack was brilliantly unnerving, this "tribute" seems sharp and annoying. Even the cast, which can sometimes be decent, offers histrionic performances that only scream "caricatures"; the notable exception to this is a clever breakthrough by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family. <br /> <br /> The worst performer here is surprisingly De Niro. Of course, it seems appropriately threatening but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura runs out. Now I'm not an expert on American accents, originally I came from near Manchester, England, all in all, but surely could have found a more convincing Southern accent than that? Being the talented physical actor he is, he has almost overcome this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was puzzling to me, as a De Niro fan, to want to be off screen rather than raping him at his performance. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE SPOILER.) <br /> <br /> the flagship style of the entire film extends to the ridiculously overwhelmed ending. When will Scorsese discover that underestimating the situation can sometimes create tensions with the same effectiveness as giving the viewer a visual and sound bombardment? I also thought it was too respected a reputation for using the "killer-not-dead-yet" economic trick that talented people could employ. <br /> <br /> All in all, a completely ridiculous thriller. Scorsese and De Niro did MUCH better to work together.
