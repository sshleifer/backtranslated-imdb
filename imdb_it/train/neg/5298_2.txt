I rented this film because I was looking through the horror movies section for those movies that nobody has ever heard of and could be a possible gem. I saw it and, since I'm a fan of violence and blood, I understood it. Has the EM score which means: Extremely mature. Thinking that this rare and high score was totally intended for violence and all the rest, I understood it. The warning on the box said: Extreme Violence, Extreme Langauge and Nudity. "Extreme violence" has affected my imagination. The film ended up being a rather docile slasher film. He had one or two gory scenes, but I saw worse in a PG-13 movie. Obviously the amount of blood in a movie isn't all that matters, right? You have plot too. Well, the plot was boring and there was nothing really special. Don't rent it. I tell the truth. I can't imagine how anyone can really have fun to the point where they say, "I'll rent it again." He had his moments where he kept you going, but I'll never see that movie again.
