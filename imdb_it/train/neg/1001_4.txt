I rented it on DVD and I feel bad because Dawson and Lugacy are so serious in the comments on the DVD. It's not exactly a bad movie, but it's one of those films that desperately wants to be a profound commentary on human nature without realizing that its history is practically a genre. Moreover, it is a bit simplistic about the problem in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often puts a strain on beliefs. I would say it's a movie that you could get something from if you don't have a lot of movies / TV / literature / life behind you (to be honest, I've seen almost exactly the same story even in horror comics). Otherwise, his point was made earlier and more skillfully. And this comes to the big problem, which is that it doesn't have much cinematic interest to it besides the point. It ends up being a fairly bland film that invests everything in the idea that the basic story will be shocking and compelling, and actually doesn't pay off.
