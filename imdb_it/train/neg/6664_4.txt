What begins as a delicate country yarn, harmless and pleasantly romantic, the story changes rhythm while Edward Norton's charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the left, while the film gradually changes from a Southern novel to a modern wild western. <br /> <br /> A lovely breeder (Norton) roams the city and enchants a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood), apparently saving her from a lifeless existence with her irascible father with a whirling love story, but gradually it becomes clear that there is more to this cowboy than the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? a true chameleon actor (with shifting facial hair to match) who plays a country hick, a slightly spooky accent but perhaps because he is simply trying to play the part without worrying about the accent. Certainly it makes it seem simple to make all the little nuanced adjustments as we learn more about Harlan. However, with too many small changes it means that we are never sure exactly where Harlan comes from, and what looked like a good performance from Norton gradually gets confused. Evan Rachel Wood is nice without ever having much more to do than blinking at Norton. <br /> <br /> Down in the Valley strikes as a somewhat erratic tale due to its change of pace, and never making the protagonist's motives really clear, the audience's sympathies with the characters remain uncertain. Should we like this tramp or not? Even after a dramatic turn of events it is not clear. This ambiguity is to the detriment of the film, as if the writer could not decide what kind of story they wanted to tell and was satisfied with a little spiciness. If the film had remained one or the other it could have been a solid film, but since it is what remains there is a kind of disaster. Fans of old-fashioned romanticism will appreciate a part of the film, but will be put off by the dark tone. Admirers of Norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the San Fernando valley), give it a lack.
