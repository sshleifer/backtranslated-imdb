Add to the list of caricatures: a Southern preacher and "congregation", a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing chorus, and The Mills Brothers - only make things worse. <br /> <br /> Contemptible burlesques by "Negro" artists, who often appear in films to parody themselves and their race. Although the "comedy negra" may have been accepted in his time, today it is extremely offensive and I doubt that it was always fun. Although I would not have been offended, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I might not have understood a little.
