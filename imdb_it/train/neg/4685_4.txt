Until the last minutes of the film, I would have given the film a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so terrible and "Hollywoodized" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for the launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders. The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and the first officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington is stationary until it eventually leads to an armed uprising aboard the submarine. Eventually, the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cold. However, here comes the part that doesn't sound real. After returning to the ground and going to a review committee, Washington and Hackman (who have just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all friends! Eh? Tritium too fine to make the film worthy of note for me.
