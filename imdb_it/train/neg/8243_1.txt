The word in the summary sums it up d'oh;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home, when they stop in a shop to get directions they hit a car parked breaking a lighthouse, they make the scene at the fair to finish in trouble but suddenly they see a lighthouse behind them (ooooh). From there everything is screaming, crying and violent when they try to get away from this crazy woman who lost her because of a lighthouse;), well, the scream and crying practically remain through the whole film (very annoying) The film it's shot, with an inexpensive camera that tries to make it look "real" or "shocking", I guess, it's just embarrassing and still useless. Lacking something better to compare with "Blair witch style". <br /> <br /> The scream and crying for almost the whole movie with a lousy sound was over annoying, you literally have a headache :) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but not it was scary, just an annoying piece of painful shit.
