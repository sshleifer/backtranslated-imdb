holy god it was terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought I was going to look very hard in the Oedipus Rex manor. my god. this movie does not deserve more credit than anything made by a middle school film lover. please save your money, this movie cannot offer you anything. unless you like presentations and sleeping in cinemas. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and make things interesting. you will be the only ones there anyway. F @ ck this presentation. <br /> <br /> I warn you. <br /> <br /> I recommend you don't watch this. <br /> <br /> hello. <br /> <br /> how are you? <br /> <br /> I'm quite well. <br /> <br /> Am I enjoying this day? <br /> <br /> I am. <br /> <br /> this comment was a hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this movie daym. this is sad.
