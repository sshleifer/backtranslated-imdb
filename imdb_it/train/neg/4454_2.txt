First a little history; I am English and have lived in London all my life. I have been to many games in "The Den" and in many other London clubs. I am familiar with the kind of person who goes into hooliganism and I know how they act and how they speak. I must say that this is a bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unrealistic films I've ever seen. I spent most of the movie getting excited about embarrassment. I felt I had to write a mini review because I felt I had to indicate some things. <br /> <br /> a) People don't really talk like that in London in real life; the filmmakers took the jargon excessively and made it stupid. Unfortunately there are types of hooligans, but the ones you see on Green Street are more like parodies. b) The actor who plays Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam) unfortunately plays as "English" or "cockney" as Osama bin Laden. He comes from north to Newcastle and I'm simply amazed that the other actors can continue to act directly next to him - how we should take him seriously. Because they didn't just take someone from East London to play that part is beyond me. I too could have done a "rocking job", hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I mean, how can I expect to take Elijah Wood seriously by kicking the butt of people twice their size and being really bad thugs. Would be dead. Simple like that. Honestly (like an Englishman) it was hard to watch this movie. I'm pretty sure this movie will bomb here in the UK. He could do a little better in the United States because Americans don't know (or worry) how inaccurate they are. <br /> <br /> Please, my American and foreign friends, do not believe a word of this nonsense. Yes, these companies exist but it is all extremely underground and silent, and on a much smaller scale. The film only gets a 2 from me because they actually shot some in London. They usually try to film these things in Cardiff (Wales) or something like that and expect everyone to miss it.
