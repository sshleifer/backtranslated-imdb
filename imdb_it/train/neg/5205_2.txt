Minimal script, minimal character development, minimum stable camera. Maximum elongated scenes, maximum headache that induces jerky zoom, maximum number of characters walking in the woods without doing anything. Until the time flashes on the screen at 12:01 pm, you can go on fast and lose nothing, since there are three hunters who know nothing about doing nothing. To be honest, the film has some interesting strings, so maybe a music video would be the way to do it. Unfortunately it would not have been so, and what should have been a twenty-minute short is strained beyond belief. Forget "Trigger Man", I know I'm trying to do it. - MERK
