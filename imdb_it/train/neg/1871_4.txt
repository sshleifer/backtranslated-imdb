Despite the lavish production numbers and wonderful costumes this film is a task to watch. The plot of the mystery of the murder is only a vehicle on which to mount the musical numbers, but often brings the jobs to a staggering stop, in addition to not being very engaging. Although there was obviously a lot of money spent on them, the numbers are badly scripted and poorly photographed. Obviously it's a pre-coded film because girls often wear very few clothes and there's even a song that sings the praises of marijuana! The performances are all of a note, although it's nice to see Carl Brisson in a musical, but when Victor McLaglen, as Police Lieutenant, is in sight for the umpteenth time looking for clues, you might want to throw in the towel or less fast forward to the next number. Too bad for the patrons who were trapped in the cinema when it was released!
