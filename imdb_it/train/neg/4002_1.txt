The social commentary has been distorted and the mystery itself has been constructed and solved through a series of implausible coincidences that were completely unlikely. Nothing has changed in Fitz's personal life in the last ten years, which makes it remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> I even had a hard time understanding why he complained about his stay in Australia over the opportunities to solve the mysteries he has in England. Can't creep into the Australian police? It looks like a very artificial plot to involve him in a criminal investigation. <br /> <br /> The last episodes of the original series were rather melodramatic and implausible, sometimes to the point of nonsense, and this collects that mantle rather than return to the center of the first series. Sad.
