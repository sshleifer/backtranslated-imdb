I won't waste a lot of time for this because, as far as I'm concerned, it's not really a movie to begin with, just a distracted mixture of borrowed movies and a new embarrassingly new movie made for the sole purpose of pasting the entire casino and call it a sequel to "Boogeyman". Literally 80% of this movie is stolen by its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a film that the writers of this junk apparently didn't even bother to watch because they couldn't even get the name of Suzanna's original character Love (Lacy) right. And to add insult to injury, the killer is invisible in the original movie visible in the new movie, apparently they think the public is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I hope that the IMDb classification system has gone so low, the most insensitive and blatant attempt to snatch the money of the people I saw, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
