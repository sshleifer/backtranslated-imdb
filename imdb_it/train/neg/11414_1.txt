This film makes "American Pie" a sophisticated movie! No further comments are required. Humor is cheap, dialogues are stupid and the cast is uncomfortable. Every clich√© is used multiple times without any original touch. And the worst, the film turns out to be more Catholic than the Pope. It's so sad.
