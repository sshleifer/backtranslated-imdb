By the time this film was released, I had seen Chorus Line on stage four times, and had anticipated the long-term production of a film in the story more impatiently. My wife and I were online hours before the box office opened the day the film was released. It wasn't just a disappointment, it was a kick in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> First, the story was "transferred to the outside", so to speak, including scenes not on the theater's borders. These boundaries are a large portion of the meaning and impact of history. <br /> <br /> Second and Third together (assign your order): one of the original songs, with a very dynamic dance number, has been removed; a song was added that was NOT in the stage production. What ?? I'm confused! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 2-star movie instead of 1 is my admiration for the talent and hard work of the artists. Now I've seen Chorus Line on stage 6 times, and I wouldn't mind seeing it 6 more times before I die. It is superbly written, with wonderful music and true and heartbreaking stories. If you want to see a musical that includes a "cattle call" audition, I recommend All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of A Chorus Line, watch it on stage.
