Maaan, where do I start with this terrible movie. Bad bad story. I don't know what the director was thinking when he made this film. Namaste London was a pleasant enough movie to be honest ... even though the soundtrack was good. But in this ... my good ... for a film that should be musical ... the songs are really bad. AR Rahman should have been the musical director. <br /> <br /> Considered two great actors, the director should have done a much better job. Even if the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie are OK. The performances of Salman and Ajay save the film from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you have nothing better to do. The last nice Bollywood movie I've seen (and I watch a lot) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
