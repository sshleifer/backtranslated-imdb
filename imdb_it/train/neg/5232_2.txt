Becky Harris plays the woman who has the misfortune of being in the shop at the wrong time and obviously the ONLY purpose of being in this film is to provide a reason to consume the remote controls! Miss Harris seems to me to be more or less fifty years old when she comes on the scene for the first time. Once the redheaded hooligan is done with her, it becomes clear that this is not an AARP queen. If these are not some of the best resources ever shown on celluloid, I want someone to let me in. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally ran out of my VHS copy capturing its charm. I'd like to know if this movie is available on DVD. <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is not really worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed in both respects. God bless Becky Harris!
