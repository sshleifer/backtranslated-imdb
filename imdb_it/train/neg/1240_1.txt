I think everyone was pretty disappointed with this science fiction movie. First, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of what a classic should be. I found it boring, disgusting and ridiculous. If you saw it, you know what I mean. Almost everyone in Imdb says it's crap and boy, they're right! If you don't have it, avoid it. He's a snorer. 1 in 10.
