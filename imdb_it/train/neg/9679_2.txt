This film was terrible in the worst way: you didn't care. You don't care what happened in the plot; you didn't care about the characters. All were heartless. I ended up going out for about 45 minutes because I just didn't want to think about it anymore. There is too much sex in the film. Sex can be okay; he can even make the film (hence the Karma Sutra) but the relationship here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't see this movie.
