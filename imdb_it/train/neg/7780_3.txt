I barely managed to stop myself or abandon this asshole, but decided to keep it out, if only for the reasoning that maybe * something * would happen. This is the work of a special writer / producer / director / fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie. This is what he wanted, anyway. What is discovered is a lot of acting, or slightly hammy or simply banal and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves like monsters ATTACKS in the waters of the river (oh, and how lucky, a woman understood be naked in it ... even if there have already been some disappearances!) <br /> <br /> This is just a nonsense stuff, but I suppose it's not too harmful; is not very obnoxious and once or twice give us a semi-interesting peek of the Brazilian "culture" (which is the father who walks around the city with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of "hey, this is NOT the America! "). But whatever the director's hope of launching Mitchum or Carradine is squandered in the best pedestrian dialogue and at worst atrociously trivial and stupid. It doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good view of the monster and the "action" happens, this too is foolishly staged and with only sleazy charm. Usually I would mind for a director who had a lot of trouble finishing a particular image - in this case he took the better part of the mid-70s - but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it's called ... nah. <Br /> <br /> If you happen to get Elvira's double DVD feature (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure you skip this. Unless, of course, you are not a hard Elvira and you can't make yourself hear her sensual comment; personally, I'd rather take Joel or Mike Nelson with the Mystery Science Theater robots on this turkey roast.
