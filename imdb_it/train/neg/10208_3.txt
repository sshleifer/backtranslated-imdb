There's something frustrating about watching a movie like "Murder by number" because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie that tries to appear. However, when the credits are released, it cannot be saved. The whole thing has almost exploded from the "cop side" of the story, in which the murder detective characters of Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin merge into an embarrassing sexual affair that becomes increasingly trivial the longer the film goes on. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it is not enough to save the sluggish script and the lazy rhythm. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a role to be forgotten (he did much better at the beginning of the year in the underestimated 'Birthday Girl') and also Chris Penn, who has such a thankless role that you feel sorry for a talent like him. However, the plot is actually not even a factor in this film. The two young murderers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to watch this film. Their talent and chemistry work quite well and they enjoy each other quite well. Too bad they weren't in a much better all-around movie. Barbet Schroeder is treading too safe a terrain for such an experienced filmmaker. Bottom Line: it's worth a rent if you're a fan of the genre, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except perhaps on the TV network with convenient commercial breaks.
