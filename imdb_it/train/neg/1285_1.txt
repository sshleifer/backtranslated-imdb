Born, raised and educated in Scotland, I was stunned by this disgusting portrait of a man who was neither more nor less than a cattle farmer. Worse still, the main theme of the entire film was sex in one form or another, by implication or verbally. To see it, one might think that 18th century Scotland was populated by a group of sexual and homosexual perverts. Lange was a joke that acted like the "young" mother at 49, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "bath" in a Scottish lake is NOT a common place as they depicted it, but it gave them another opportunity to show how sexually motivated we were. Save your money and look at Pinnochio.
