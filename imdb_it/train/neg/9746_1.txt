I remember this film, an exhibition in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for a week's time. Although it might seem unbelievable, and I can't offer any explanation for this, this film has been exhibited in a theater dedicated to ... high quality art films (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel, e. .. The Projected Man). Few people have seen it (fortunately people, no doubt) and no reference to this tedious science fiction film can be found in the science fiction encyclopedia of Peter Nichols or on the author of the original novel. Very indicative I remember, after all these years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that seem ridiculous effects of fact, and no more. It seems that in some countries the execution time is 90 mm. and in anothers 77 min. Well, it just means a little more pain.
