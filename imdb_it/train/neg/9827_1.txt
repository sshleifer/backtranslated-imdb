First of all, this film reminded me of the old movies I had to watch in religion class at school. It's NOT a good thing Basically, it's just a favorite and pretentious piece of dirt, just like the terrible "Left Behind" series. I am not offended by religious films ... but I am offended when these religious films are simply terrible. I just wish I could say nice things about a Christian movie, but it doesn't seem to be happening soon. I bet if you gave the Bible a decent budget, they wouldn't find anything good. Just avoid this. Also, the fact that the "American Family Association" (basically, the Reverend Wildmon lefties) talked about this film on their website is another reason to make me hate. In fact, after seeing this, I returned home and looked at my copy of David Cronenberg's "Crash" classified as NC-17. Forgive me father because I have sinned. Ha ha ha ha ha!
