What can we say about a poorly filmed and poorly filmed 16mm adult film in which the best and most attractive performer is a German shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this farce at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, since bestiality remains a taboo and illegal subject in the United States. I strongly advise IMDb to re-visit their weighting formula to establish assessments, since an 8.8 score for this piece of fecal matter is absurd! I'm not, at all, a prostitute and I spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; but this is an inferior product even for the looser standards of the male cycle (then illegal).
