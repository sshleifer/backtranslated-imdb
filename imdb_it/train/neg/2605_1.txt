Although I recently put it on my list of the 10 worst films, I must say that it's probably no worse than Burt Reynolds in "The Maddening" or in one of the sequels to "Look Who's Talking". Still, it's rather sickening, even with the sexy Drew Barrymore who plays something of a horror film response to Holly Golightly, moving from New York to Los Angeles, but discovering that she's being haunted by a resembling murderer. Poor Sally Kellerman, an eccentric highly successful actress in the 70s, has reduced herself to a paltry supporting role, and the protagonist of Barrymore, George Newbern, is the worst kind of sitcom actor, always paused for a laugh after every joke. The photo is drab, but Drew's bloody shower scene boasts spectacularity, and the identity of the psychopath (even though it came from an episode of "Scooby Doo") is interesting. But as for the ending ... it becomes reality! Who had to clean that mess? * from ****
