haha! you just have to smile and smile if you actually did all this movie. I like to say something about myself, I think. the film itself was created I think it's a kind of psychological test, or a kind of drug, to take you to a place where you've never been before. When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece, the tractacus (sp?), He said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you finished, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw away the work and see things clearly and with real understanding. this film is the same as I think. <br /> <br /> As a film, it is undoubtedly the worst film I've seen in such a unique way in a long time. first of all, this is snipes. I really enjoyed watching this guy in various movies. and I suffered through some weak ones. however, even if you know the movie could suck, you would never suspect it could be as bad as it really is. that is fun. I mean, this is a sniper. you know it could be good, but it will be fine, right? you smile. <br /> <br /> so this thing at every level is pure boredom, pure originality. the reference to the professional is at the same time obvious and obvious, yet so badly made as to be comic. there is not one character in this film that is interesting, at least. and to make it more surreal, they have a soundtrack that sounds like parts of various Bourne identity films, it's just not quite right. in fact, even if it seems close to the background music of the action movie, so it happens that it is done in a way that will scratch you in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> then all the scenes in total black tone, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you don't really care what will happen, but regardless, after that happens and someone is killed, you tell yourself, did I have to see it? what else? how about scenes with blinding lights, hateful strobe lights, for too long a period of time to bear. sure, let's throw it inside. when you strain and your eyes can't handle them anymore, do some more of these in the murders of the dark, where you really don't see what happened. and moreover, let me not make you interested. you were so bored from the beginning. <br /> <br /> so I drifted a couple of times, but I caught almost all of this movie. and it becomes something you can watch, without something that engages your mind at any level, so it becomes something with which you can effectively isolate yourself and start thinking about your life, where it is going, where it has been, what we are people. <br /> <br /> and that ... this is the real magic of this movie.
