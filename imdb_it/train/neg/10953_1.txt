This excuse of television trash is the single most terrible piece of trash that has ever hit Australian television. The housemates are boring, disinterested, ridiculously not intelligent and are chosen based on the fact that it is likely that you will try to kill them if you live with them. For me, Big Brother is the decline of Western society, showing how we as a society are on a steep slope to become deficient dead in the brain. Whatever happened to television that does not target the lowest common denominator of society? This cannot be classified as entertainment. I think it's true that Channel Ten can remove your soul. It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and, once transferred to Channel 10, he became horribly unpleasant. With the exception of The Simpsons, which was very cleverly made.
