While watching this film, a screenplay for a film came to my mind, entitled "The Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Producer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is we can take Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Scriptwriter: It's great! But what are the bad news? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: we can afford to hire you only for one day. I guess we'll have to take someone else. <br /> <br /> Writer: So let's take it for a day. A film lasts an hour and a half. A working day lasts eight hours. I can't see a problem. <br /> <br /> Producer: But ... you will have to spend time entering the character. <br /> <br /> Writer: So we make him interpret a character that is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Producer: But he will still need to understand his motivations and everything else. You're not saying we're going to make him play a big name actor who's shooting a low budget movie, right? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: it's ridiculous! But that's okay, at least we'll have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I imagine we will have to set the film in Los Angeles too. <br /> <br /> Writer: Obviously. <br /> <br /> Producer: This script is a bunch of shit. We'd better make money with this. Just in case, enter the character of Morgan Freeman, Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone will want to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Writer: Of course! <br /> <br /> Producer: Wait a minute ... what is this story about a small bodega with an "express lane" of ten items or less? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I guess it's pretty weird. But we can't change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt that my script actually has much similarity to reality, but then not even "10 elements or less". This is a case of good acting, but of bad writing, and I hate to see it happen. When you watch an independent film, you expect it to try to convey a sort of message. I think they could have tried for the tired old man "don't let something hold you back" a message that was made to die in much better films. In any case, with "10 items or less", the only message I received was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
