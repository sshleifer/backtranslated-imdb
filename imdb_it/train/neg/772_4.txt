This film is not as good as all the Christ movies I've ever seen. And I am quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well as the other films) are different. A very important issue is also missing: the resurrection. None of the other films skip this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies precisely in this event. As Paul says in one of his letters "If Christ has not risen from the dead, our faith is vain". A very impressive scene for me in this film was seeing in the streets the remains of the palm trees that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And indeed, he was also a Jew. There are many documents (religious and profane) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say, God becomes a man) that has really changed humanity. I highly recommend it (since he is a historian) to read Flavio Giuseppe, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the first. Century.
