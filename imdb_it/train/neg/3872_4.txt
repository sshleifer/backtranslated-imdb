The film never becomes intolerable to watch. And to put it plainly, he has nothing to show, except perhaps the sexy part of Alicia Silverstone in a nerdy character not sexy in revealing pretty sexy clothes. The plot is very easy to follow or there is nothing to follow - you can see it both ways. There is no suspense, little action, insignificant dialogues, unsatisfactory sensuality, the same boring and very bland places. Kevin Dillon is totally useless. Silverstone ... well, I didn't focus too much on his acting, I confess. Yet, as I said before, if one has nothing to do but watch a movie, it won't seem so bad. 4/10
