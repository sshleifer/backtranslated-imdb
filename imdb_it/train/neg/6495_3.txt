I rented this film about what the trailer showed, and of course about Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack joined David Lynch and Timothy Leary in making a movie, this would be the end result. I don't think I saw a movie like the one that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Street. <br /> <br /> It is a group of scripts in which the characters flash inside and outside of reality, or various realities, and the film does not culminate in anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. I wrote a severe review on my film review blog that essentially gives it all, and I won't do it here. It is a well acted theatrical piece, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say that, if there is a saving feature in this film, it is music. It fits perfectly. Some dialogues are incredibly good, and incredibly bad all at the same time. <br /> <br /> I liked parts of this movie, I really did it, and once it came to an end, I actually understood what was really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of madness to reach a salient point that minimizes the effect of the entire film. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film is not acting, that's all.
