Sometimes this movie was fun, sometimes it was even fun. <br /> <br /> The basic message I received from the film is that women are responsible for all human problems. Whenever a woman is represented in the film, she is lazy, slutty or harasses a poor boy for no apparent reason. I don't think the message in question is good for gay women or men. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and a work of art, so it's simply someone's point of view. Even if they disagree, they still have the right. <br /> <br /> A funny film, but some of the comments others have made are simply stupid. Best movie ever.
