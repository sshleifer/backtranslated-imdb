I'm basing this on my observations on an episode I saw last night (09/27/06). I don't think I'll be watching again. The acting was entirely in wood, the plot completely predictable, the end totally unrealistic - I mean who would have believed a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role - maybe he realized how bad the writing was !! I fully understand that the drama offered this season is rather poor, but they can certainly find better writers. Maybe they are outsourcing the writing in India or in China !! I bet we won't see this next season!
