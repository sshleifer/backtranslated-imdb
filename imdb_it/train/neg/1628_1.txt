Undoubtedly one of the most embarrassing productions of the 70s, GAOTS really does seem to really want to be something important. The tragic truth is that it is so completely worthless at all levels that you can't help but laugh. Reaching desperation for the earthly elements of Ingmar Bergman's films, a couple's day in the wild follows ... they walk along a shady path, placing themselves in the meantime like a U.C. Berkeley coffee horn. Almost all the tarradiddle lines of dialogue reported here are terribly bad ("I feel that life itself is made up of many small compartments like this pomegranate ... but is it so beautiful?") happening (well ... OK ... we are treated to a bit of nudity and a warm soft sex scene), there is finally a VERY anticlimatic comparison involving a couple of Nam vets who are doing the nature scene and they are performing rather tough folk ballads with an acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing that happens significantly or interesting happens IN THIS ENTIRE FILM. I thought that the photo of Larry Buchanan "Strawberries Need Rain" was a weak example of a tribute to Bergman. "Golden Apple" is just as bad, but the incessant incessant verbosity that it presents makes it memorably terrible. 1/10
