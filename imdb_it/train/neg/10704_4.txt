It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it's up to a cop, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop him. <br /> <br /> An action movie B that borrows from other films and is quite good with a good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these films) and three beautiful stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as a policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid action B movies, this is not for you.
