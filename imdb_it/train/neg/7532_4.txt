Something that I really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of the theme, especially in "Living with happiness". This film has beautiful origins - unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but it fails to have a clumsy exhibition dialogue, fragmented performances and much television coverage. <br /> <br /> Once again it is a fascinating television and a lot of ordinary cinema. The ideas are so detailed that they almost look like a TV commercial. But the feeling is good, so we can't complain too much. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to see this director do a whole animation and try and work with a producer that doesn't require so much boring clarity.
