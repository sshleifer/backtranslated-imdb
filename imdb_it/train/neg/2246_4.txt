I've never seen the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so I have no means of comparison. Also, some years have passed, but I found this story neither compelling nor romantic. The film tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are directed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a disenchanted, consummate, declining rock star who embarks on a love story with a new, fresh and talented singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. His dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline. <br /> <br /> The main actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left a mark on me. The film is noteworthy for me just for one aspect, Streisand's beautiful interpretation of Oscar-winning song "Evergreen". He really has a powerful and magnificent voice.
