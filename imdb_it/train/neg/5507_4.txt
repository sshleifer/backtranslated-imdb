This was yet another big screen release for a TV show in the United States in the 1960s. It's quite fun, but it was a real formula. Intelligent Martian lands on Earth and meets not too bright humans, according to his point of view. <br /> <br /> The usual oddity arises with the human, Bridges, eventually binds to him and helps him get home. Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> This is a nice trip for some beautiful Hollywood stars I haven't seen in a while. <br /> <br /> Nice enough to spend some free time if you have nothing better to see.
