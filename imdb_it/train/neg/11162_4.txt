Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie film for 14 years. Do I have to write another eight lines? Ana de la Reguera is in place to watch, like a Mexican nun who bears the rather forward and unkind advances of Jack Black. This film is a PG 13 version of an independent film. I really like a film that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film deeply explores Mexican culture. I just choked on his cultural rudeness: Jack Black is so rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most precious emissary in Mexican culture, so to speak. The culture of Mexican Wrestling is not the most diaphanous place of a white boy, as I could look for. I suspect that Mexico is culturally more opaque than Jack Black presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb has changed my review. Has anyone else even changed your review?
