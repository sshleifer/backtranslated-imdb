It would be useful to know why it took so long for a book ready for the film "as" The House Next Door "to be adapted to cinema or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason could be design problems of 'home'. The home in this Lifetime movie is really so bad that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact it's so ugly that someone would probably come and destroy it as soon as it was built. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy about horror books, but this was hard to criticize when I came through it about ten years ago, and the main characters are not the kind of people looking for something hidden in life, and this it is one of the strengths of the book: they are not people who would conclude that the architect was a type of demon .. (or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. avia, for the most part it's an unexpected book, and I don't think it appeals to the people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come out with another version of the book for years to come. A better home ... better music ... better script and darker lighting ... would certainly help.
