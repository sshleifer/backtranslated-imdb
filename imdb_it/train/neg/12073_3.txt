*** SPOILERS *** With a gathering of relatives and servants of the late Christopher Dean, John Carradine, to hear his last will and testament, somehow have a surprise that Dean's fortune, about 140 million dollars . The money must be shared between them but only after having successfully spent a week in the Dean's villa. There seemed to have been a confusion in the story when we later discovered that it is indeed a night-time pajama, not a week's holiday, in the guest villa to qualify for Dean's money since almost everyone ends up dying at dawn. br /> <br /> The first victim of Dean Curse has nothing to do with obtaining and the money from the property of Christopher Dean deceased the local sheriff Dan Garcia, Rodolfo Acosta. Acosta has his head cut off in the fridge and then served on a tray to a group of shocked guests. Later that evening, the cute little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow and Marry Anders, is found dead just outside the pond. <br /> <br /> The film has gathered all the people staying at the Dean Mansion one at a time until it is revealed who the killer really is. So we have what appears to be a double spin in history where the original killer is suddenly killed along with two of the last remaining guests. The real murderer ends up not only getting all the loot, 140 million dollars, but then ends up not having to share it with his accomplice by doing him or her, giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot. br /> <br /> Absurd that it did, and haunted house, film with a cast of characters so immoral and unlikely that even a mother, let alone the public, would have had sympathetic problems. There is everything you can think of in the move that involves selective guests that includes the S&M incest sadism and, of course, the double game and the backstabbing, not to mention the murder. You can't care less who of the guests survives to collect Dean's fortune at the end of the film hoping against any hope that then none of them will do. <br /> <br /> Even the big surprise at the end is not It is really a surprise, since the identity of the killer was disclosed with the director who forgot to keep his face in the shadows so to see who is even before it turns out! So we have a plot weave that eliminates the killer along with a number of remaining guests just to make the movie a little more confusing than it already is. The final twist, which you can see coming up to ten miles away, was just to show how clever the very obvious killer who almost deceived anyone by watching the movie.
