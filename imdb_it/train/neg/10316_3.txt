To be honest, at the time when I heard about this show for the first time, I think it could be a bad idea to do a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes about themselves, but it's the exact opposite. I realized that the show that does this can help people understand that if a Muslim uses a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it's a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, observing the show normal people will understand that although there may be bad Muslims, it does not mean that we are all bad, but we just try to live 1 day after day, as it was difficult for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like "Blow up" or Yaser that said we would wipe out the competition, and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim, I know that things like that don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are treated badly by watching this show and could make us think about how the act is. I'm glad a show like this came on the air. There are many shows that the people of Piotr Muslim like terrorists, many people find them funny for my opinion, it's OK to do it from time to time, because everything is teased by who we are to say that you can't make fun of it unfairly , but it is often done and really gives Muslin's people a bad name.
