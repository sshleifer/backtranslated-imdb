Recently, I saw the documentary "The revolution will not be broadcast", also known as "Chávez: inside the coup". At first I thought it showed a true internal view of events during the Venezuelan coup d'état of April 2002. What bothered me was the fact that the tone of the narrative and the accompanying music were suggestive, and that in no point to criticize Hugo Chavez. This is peculiar because if a documentary gives a non-distorted account of what happened, it should have been partly. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, a lot of additional information is available today, and it was not difficult to find, for example, "Urgent Investigation on Chavez - the coup d'état of the 5 European television companies that financed the film has obvious lies On Venezuela ". List the numerous errors and falsifications that are foreseen or unintended in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you'll find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of a presentation of the results of the numerous errors in this documentary, "X-ray of a lie". For me it seems to be a good counterweight to "Chávez: inside the coup" It is available on video.google. I highly recommend you after seeing "Chávez: inside the coup" to watch "X-ray of a lie" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowingly or not) part of Chavez's propaganda.
