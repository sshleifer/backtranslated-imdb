You might be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most useless films ever made. I kept waiting for something funny to happen, but nothing funny appears in this movie. Even the film industry recognized that it was a very weak film and did not even try to promote it. It is a wonder that it has ever been put on video. I wonder what kind of contract induced Sellers to act in this film. I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to make other bad films. Surely this film is a waste of money used to create it, and a waste of time for anyone to watch it. Surely there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a film rather than a plot.
