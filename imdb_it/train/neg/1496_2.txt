Evil Breed is a very strange slasher film that unfortunately is not good. The beginning of the film looks promising, but overall it's a disaster. The dialogue is rather ugly but not as bad as acting. The acting is brutal and unbearable. the characters deliver the lines horribly and even if this is on purpose, the method does not work because the characters become annoying. Some of the killings are innovative but it took too long to get to them. After about half an hour through the film we get the first death (except at the beginning) and then almost every other character is smoked in the next five minutes. The film then turned into a kind of parody with ridiculous-looking characters, unrealistic karates like fights and a scene where a man gets his gut pulled out of his sscrack. It's not funny it's just ridiculous. The film thus becomes ultra-rox and ultra useless. Most of the characters are clich√©s even by slasher standards and are as solid as but left on the counter for 5 days. Evil Breed is not even ridiculously bad, so he fails in his main task. Watch the Chainsaw massacre in Texas, just before dawn, or see no evil for a real slasher.
