Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were big as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What is his name was cute as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, banal and boring. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was designed like a paint of a child according to the routine of numbers. The characters were pieces of cut-out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and this completely overcame the acting, which was a shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, too bad that the writer was not the victim. Especially with the "early" lines of the child, which were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Once again, it is only acting that has prevented a much lower score.
