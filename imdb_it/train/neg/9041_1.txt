I liked the film despite the hectic pace. BUT, I didn't appreciate the comment that Canada was called Montana North. It is definitely NOT Montana Nord and it never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and this is one of the reasons why. Stop teaching children in the United States to think about owning the planet. This view of the centrist world is not becoming one of the great nations of the world. Even as a joke. I would never speak of the United States as of "Alberta Sud". Walt would never put us down, so why start now. Besides this, the film was pretty stupid, better luck next time.
