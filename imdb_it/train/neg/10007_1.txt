This film is mediocre at best. Angie Harmon is fun like a bag of hammers. His "Law and Order" bitch attitude continues in a failed comedy attempt. Charlie Sheen is the only one to come out unscathed in this horrible anti-comedy. The only positive thing to get out of this mess is the marriage between Charlie and Denise. We hope that this effort will produce better results.
