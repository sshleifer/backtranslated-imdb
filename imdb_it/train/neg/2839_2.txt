This film is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's great to laugh. The dialogue can become incredibly ridiculous and misunderstood (for example, "Manji, can we ask you some questions?" "Sure." "We think you can help us with the answers.") Every fight is more or less surreal. Make sure you look for Brock, the black and white guy who attacks the main characters. It has only two lines, but it's one of the best in the film!
