How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel not have ANY fun in it? Believe it or not, House Bunny did this better and more fun. I hope the presidents have had a great vacation and have had some money - this film is embarrassing for them all. It's a cliché from beginning to end. The clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This film does nothing but use clichés after clichés rather than ideas or scripts. Use the pre-existing actress personalities rather than develop characters. Bad, sad and garbage. Now apparently I have to have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT operations manager this is another example of sloppy coding.
