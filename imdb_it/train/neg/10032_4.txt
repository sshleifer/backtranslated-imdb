The plot was fine. Akshay Kumar was as good as ever and this was the only good thing about the film. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so much hue and tears on its zero size, but it didn't look leaner. I don't know why the hell Anil Kapoor has accepted such a bad role. There was not much for him to do in the film. Just because it's a Yashraj movie, doesn't mean that an actor should accept the role as bad as it is. He said Ali khan was fine. I think it's time for Indian filmmakers and producers to start thinking about Indian customers as a smart bag. What are we? crazy people !!!! What they think, they will show 2 men taking a SWAT team at two at a time and they will believe it. The Indian police are so stupid that they are trying to catch some criminals ... they take an entire team of 100+ policemen and nobody was there to surround the building. The action was disgusting and I've never seen such bad actions. Akshay Kumar was in the midst of a circle of 30-40 policemen who shot at him ... and he shot at them. None of the police bullets touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Crap. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the fight director who thought of this scene should retreat. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend NOT TO SEE THIS FILM.
