I am probably one of the few to read Stephen King's book, the one on which this film is based. After reading this excellent work, I couldn't wait to see the film version of it. After watching the movie, I was totally disappointed. The only thing this film has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put into a game. The main objective is to survive. But he is not in an arena. He went wild in the city and must escape the inhabitants of the game (I imagine you would call them), who have absolutely no resemblance to the characters in the film. This premise built a lot of tension and suspension and ended up very much with the climax. The film was absolute rubbish. There was no cinematographic quality. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he messed this up.
