this movie was as gay as if it were a mother's cat and son having sex, they are also afraid of kittens. they are burned by them. Does the mother thing of the cat kill a boy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn? they are bulletproof. Invisible. and what not the star of the film, Clovis, is the policeman's cat, Clovis leads the cops to find the alien mother, and after his mother kills the police, Clovis kills his mother by eating her head and then catches fire. this movie sucks. it was a lot more fun than it was scary, it wasn't even scary. the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera, tears it. then he goes and hugs her. the then grabs her and starts to rape her. once again, Clovis comes to the rescue
