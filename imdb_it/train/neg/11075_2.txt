Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book called "Little Fuzzy" about a man who discovered a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet. Mr. Piper died in 1964, but Hollywood and many of today's authors began to pillage his grave before his body cooled. This is the book from which they had the idea of ​​Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Skullduggery is such a repugnant "Little Fuzzy" rip-off. I wonder why I'm the only one I've ever noticed? <br /> But don't believe me on word. Here is a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of "Little Fuzzy" for free: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
