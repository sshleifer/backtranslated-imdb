Let me tell you another way: balls. Or how about stamp * ks. This is really terrible, more embarrassing than those who try to satirize. Julia Roberts is an experienced actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. This film is so devoid of direction, it also struggles to look clever. Normally she is the consummate professional, yet I swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despair. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved this move was the director's idea (Chris Walken) transforming the film into a secret documentary on the actors. Unfortunately, this theme has not been explored for its full potential. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was a Cusack and Crystal had to stick to acting. Buffy's two talented ex-stars have had different experiences - Green hopelessly misinterpreted, and under-used Balfour. Well done to Julia for almost keeping this from being the worst movie ever made.
