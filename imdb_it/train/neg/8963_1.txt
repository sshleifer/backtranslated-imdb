The killings in this film are not so bad, but certainly the film is. It's even worse than that. Nor is the wear and tear that might occur when you insert it into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear it causes on your shoulders transports it from the DVD-store, not to mention the money you spend renting and watching it. Horrible. <br /> <br /> It is beyond understanding how anyone can say something positive about this film. It was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that made me not stop watching, add to that the group's pressure from my co-observers. <br /> <br /> The manuscript is horrible, the direction even worse and the acting is despicable despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you don't see this as ruining your fun, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: don't waste your time looking at this garbage!
