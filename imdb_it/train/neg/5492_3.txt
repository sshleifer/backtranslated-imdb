People at Disney have a lot to explain. First of all, because someone thought that this minor sitcom material would ever make a film even half. In the extravagant 1960s script, the unique idea of ​​the Martians among us had not yet received the sophisticated X-Files treatment. The picturesque visions of little green men have long since been dissolved by the likes of ET, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and ALIENS 1-3. <br /> <br /> Every spell of the property was mainly due to the engaging relationship created between the late Bill Bixby as Tim and Ray Walston as the non-worldly visitor. The idea that the Martians have an antenna seemed after all. Now he looks positively idiotic. Still, Christopher Lloyd's Uncle Martin showcases metal appendages. In a first shot, the antenna on a sign for the TV station Tim works should make us think "Martian"! When was the last time you saw a TV with bunny ears, eh? <br /> <br /> Disney does not trust the features or relationships and kills this movie with special effects that include a talking space suit called Zoot! Yes, you read that right - Uncle Martin's silver space suit speaks. It should be a real hilarious! Figure again. I have more fun elastic socks than Zoot. Whenever the action is delayed (and is constantly delayed), the computer graphics are put into play to rekindle things. Tim is played here by the lovely Jeff Daniels, who can't (or won't) do anything to save this mess. Zesty Christine Ebersole brings a certain comic zeal to the role of her neighbor. Even Ray Walston himself is painfully dragged into the procedures - all without success. This alien visitor died on arrival. <br /> <br /> The constant talk of sitcoms that run on screen just makes me hope that the film I DREAM OF JEANNIE is not characterized by a complete speaking harem. I pray that Samantha's cat in the movie BEWITCHED has no lines. I live in fear that I LOVE LUCY - THE MOVIE will proudly exhibit a CG Conga Drum named Bongo. <br /> <br /> Paging Michael Eisner! Mickey Mouse - take me to your boss.
