Not one of Keaton's best efforts, this was perhaps a veiled attempt to take revenge on the family in which he had married - the Talmadges. A Polish / English language barrier and a series of coincidences lead Buster to a marriage with a great Irish woman, who (along with her father and her brothers) treats him so squalid until they think he may be an heir to a luck. The wrong identities abound here - the gags are set and, but for the principal they fail to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> This subway short has at least two real laughs - Buster is skillfully filming his lack of dinner using the calendar on the wall and his adoptive family's basic ignorance to literally bring the meat into his plate . The other is a family photo, with the whole group slowly collapsing on the floor while the camera tripod loses its stability. <br /> <br /> The overflow of yeast beer may have been the catalyst for a massive series of gags built on gags, but it stops short (for all accumulation) of development. <br /> <br /> The Kino print is sharp and clear and the score is one for piano, drums and sound effects. Not one of Buster's best efforts, but it's worth a laugh.
