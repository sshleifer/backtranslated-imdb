I watched this movie a long time ago (about 10 years or so) and I liked it then. I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. The second time was not pleasant. The acting is "so, so", the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. The plot ... there is no way to hell that those women would have gone off with the first robbery, much less the latter. (side note: why TT didn't realize that even if he found a lot of money for his date in court, they would ask him where he got it and he wouldn't have a logical answer! Ding, Ding ... we a scammer!). Black women are horribly stereotyped in saying that the only way black women can "beat the system" or get a great deal of money is to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. Sounds too much about sympathy b / c everyone dies in the end (bar Jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'They were so stupid, they deserved to die). You simply don't care about the characters, unless you are a superficial person. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this movie is worth more than 5.
