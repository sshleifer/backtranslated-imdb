When I tuned into this news for the first time, I thought "wow, finally, some entertainment". It was a little fun for a week or so ... But we have to face it, these news reporters (if you can even call them that) have TOO MUCH "playing" time. <br /> <br /> First of all, I thought Jillian was a breath of fresh air. But seriously, this woman doesn't have a minimum of journalist in her. You are very unprofessional. He continues to interrupt Steve when he starts informing viewers about a certain news bulletin. It really became annoying to the point that I can't see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, he's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. So, it instantly turns into a celebrity around celebrities who should interview. She is not very professional and probably perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a justly insatiable journalist - and that's all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than the necessary news about the world, the government, the United States or something that can benefit and / or serve the best public interest. They are too focused on the sensationalism that everything they talk about comes out as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are especially tolerable ... I think "Good Day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it's definitely not for people who really care about news. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE: (I really prefer to watch KTLA, but sometimes they try to entertain the audience, they are still a bit boring, oh, I'll just go to NBC "Today." Even the ABC "Good Morning America "okay ... until Diane Sawyer gets too serious.)
