I love a good love story (and I'm a boy) but when I rented "Love Story" I prayed for the end to arrive as quickly and painlessly as possible and exactly the opposite for the character of Ali McGraw. <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and irritated the devil out of me within the first 15 minutes. When we learn that she was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I could not help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss for poor Oliver or if someone watching this movie would also care. If she hadn't died, her grateful personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually brought them to court to divorce. <br /> <br /> People love this movie but it's one of the worst in the 70s.
