This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. The terrible acting, the terrible effects, the terrible writing, you get my direction. The stories are so far removed from the legend of Robin Hood it's incredible. It seems they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It could also have been called New Adventures by Mr. Bland Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you would like this show. This is a horrible approach to a TV series. A visual media like this should stimulate your imagination, you shouldn't force your imagination into something to make it good. It would be like the Simpson episode in which they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and start talking about who killed who or what. "If a film is boring, I just make a story of mine." <br /> <br /> In conclusion: absolute human rejection.
