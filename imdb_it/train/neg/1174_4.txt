"The Lady and the Duke" by Eric Rohmer is based on the diaries of an English aristocrat who experienced the French revolution. But it is a styled affair, with its strange and painted backgrounds and colloquial tone. In particular, this portrait of the age of terror takes place almost entirely at a point of true action; one sees very little of the common people in this film, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded far from the salons of the persecuted but spoiled, aristocratic classes. The result is often boring and ultimately not illuminating about the forces that sometimes push companies to the brink of destruction; is a disappointing film by an acclaimed director.
