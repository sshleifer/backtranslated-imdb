Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I got excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer, and being a lover of thriller, I expected to see first of all a film that moved quickly and breathed breath, that wisely tackles global politics and the relationship between oil, power and corruption, from a new perspective. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all the characters were stereotyped, braided editing made understanding of the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, you don't care in the end. Save money, save time, choose another movie. <br /> <br /> Robi Chernitsky
