In 1988, Paperhouse was hailed as a "thinking man horror film". Wow, could you say, sign up. This thing is a mess. Presents a young actress of once who has a range from 1 to 2. G. Headley with a bad British accent (dubbed), and a story without shivers, chills or spills. <br /> <br /> It isn also an interesting psychopath. You will only laugh at its economic effects and want a projection of Leprechaun 5. <br /> <br /> The story involves a girl with glandular fever who runs away in her dreams. What you get is not a good horror, art house or special after-school. I found myself after two hours saying ... where my two hours went. <br /> <br /> The management is not inspired and I wish it was even pretentious ... something interesting. It seems that the producers were lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the world of dreams things are boring. <br /> <br /> A brief no on this.
