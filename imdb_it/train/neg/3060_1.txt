This must be the most disturbing, twisted holiday film I've ever seen, and that's saying something. I know that the Mexican people have some strange ideas about religion, mixing ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead is not as scary as their interpretation of Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So..Santa is not a cheerful, fat, red-dressed alcoholic (take a look at those rosy cheeks sometimes!). Rather, he is a skinny sociopathic pedophile who lives in Heaven (or in the skies, anything), with a group of boys working harder than those in Kathy Lee Gifford's sweat shops. They sing traditional songs from their home countries while wearing such stereotyped clothes that I was surprised that there was not an African-American boy with a black face singing "Mammy". This Santa is a Peeping Tom pervert who observes and listens to everything that everyone does from his "eye in the sky". This is how he can tell who was bad or handsome (with an emphasis on those who are bad, I bet). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Claus, no elf (what do elves need for child labor?) and reindeer are mechanical spring toys! This floating phenomenon floats on a cloud, presumably supported by its silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's nemesis is ... the Devil ?! What is this, our Lord and Savior? Strange. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his servants, a rampant devil, creeper named Pitch, to try to ruin Christmas. Let me understand: the purest evil forces are trying to ruin a holiday full of commercial and commercial greed? Seems almost redundant, right? <br /> <br /> Pitch is totally ineffective. He tries to speak ill of some children, but he doesn't have much luck. I was very impressed by the plot of the child Saint Lupe, whose family is very poor. All he wants is a doll for Christmas, but parents can't afford to buy one (they spent all their money on the cardboard they built their house from). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. Actually, it's the only way a poor girl could ever have a doll, because being holy and praying to God and Saint Santa doesn't really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to take you behind her, and is rewarded by a doll that is so disturbing that you know it's Chucky's sister. <br /> <br /> Along the way Pitch manages to catch Santa in a tree (uh-huh) from where he was saved by Merlin! Merlin? You are making a fool of me! Since when did the mythical Druidic figures appear in the Christmas stories or do they have something to do with a Christian religion? And does God not disapprove of magic? They would have burned Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the aid of one of the Aspects of God (or this is what I presume Santa must be, to go against Satan). Is this film a long HUH? from beginning to end, and you will ask yourself if that eggnog you drank wasn't added or something. Probably it was, since this film is like a giant along DT.
