I realize that the US military was demoralized in 1971, but this film was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a true enemy of the army. The sergeant psychologist who continued to beat the shit of people belonged to a prison cell, and the useless black superior sergeant should have been fired as well. These men went abroad, the receiving units would surely have asked themselves where all the damaged and unusable recruits came from, and an investigation would follow. The scene that made it explode completely was that of electrocution. Farrell, the alleged barracks lawyer, would have had the barrel instructor for issuing an illegal order (to torture prisoners of war in violation of the Geneva Convention), a real assault on an enlisted, a sexual assault and unseemly conduct to an officer. Meanwhile he leaves. After this, the discipline is reduced to a crazy level and the film becomes unwatchable. I don't know how it ended, I went to bed.
