I can't believe how awful this movie was. I feel magnanimous also referring to this as a "film". The acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot left many important questions unanswered. The premise was OK, if not original: a small group of aliens lives in the United States and is trying to slowly conquer humanity. But it goes downhill quickly from there. How could they convince a "human" to accept an alien like his wife to make them human-alien hybrids they need? They show a larval alien but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon who can produce a perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. They launch the immense alien monster with teeth. The finish was almost too painful to watch. I guess I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner has something to do with it. How could he tell the huge alien monster with his teeth: "Get away from him, son of a b * tch" with a straight face? It is a long fall from his 5 days of Babylon. Avoid this at all costs.
