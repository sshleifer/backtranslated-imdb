"Fever Pitch" is not a bad movie; it's a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible that the public and the critics of American cinema are so numb and lobotomized by the droppings that Hollywood produces that will praise the skies even a mediocre film with few laughs? This is the only reason I can think about why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use this term freely because there's nothing funny in this movie) is getting good reviews. <br /> <br /> I went through this stunned film that the writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even think for a moment that their script was fun. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into film. He adapted "Fever Pitch" for a British film with Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002) and when "High Fidelity" was Americanized for a film in 2000, the writers D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg were not wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's intelligence and humor. They made one of the best films of that year. <br /> <br /> So why is the American version of "Fever Pitch" so painfully wrong? The English version was not a masterpiece, but it was fascinating, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters that we could appreciate, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have eliminated everything that is fun in Hornby's work. In Americanizing history, they slaughtered it, removing all that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replacing it with a conventional drivel. <br /> <br /> They have turned a fun story into a formidable romantic comedy, never once turning from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of whom has a distinct function. One is overweight, the second is cynical and ambitious, and the third is romantic. Want to guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" so much fun was not just a good man and a leading woman, but engaging supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch", the six support friends do or don't say anything particularly funny. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason I'm in the movie is because the formula requires it. Poor Ion Skye introduces himself as one of Lindsey's friends in an ungrateful role. The beautiful Skye should have wished that Lloyd Dobler would rush and take her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent Ben. Sure, Cusack is too smart to stick to such a boring script. <br /> <br /> There is no single solitary moment in this film that looks original or unforced. Every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke is telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel work to laugh. The first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow, you wonder if these guys realized they were writing a play. You can mark the plot turns in this movie with your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote it with the formula of a writing guru on a screen glued to the wall. When they came to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says that time must happen." It is early! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the film. They have no idea how to introduce their story and characters (they give the narration V.O not to the protagonist, but to another boy who sits behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to extremely awkward writings, we have to watch Barrymore and Fallon stumble in their unpleasant initial encounters. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is cute and adorable better than most. She is as good as Goldie Hawn in her golden age. But even his sweetness cannot save this extraordinarily terrible film. Try to get energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes into the movie, Lindsey tells Ben, "You're funny." The only explanation for his remark is that he was in the script. For Fallon, Ben never says anything even remotely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor amusing; when he makes the comedy, he exaggerates. <br /> <br /> Fallon has never been good on "Saturday Night Live". He was probably the least funny person on that show. Do you remember that nasty sketch of a radio DJ who made all the voices? The only reason why "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was because Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows a few things about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are actually funny. This is true for Fallon. He thinks he's hysterically funny when he just laughs a little. His babbling, uncertain make-up didn't work on the small screen; it's bad on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this photo also requires some dramatic moments. If you thought his play was bad, wait until you get a load of his dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the second in front of Ben's school - are painful to watch. The scenes require an actor with a dash of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even flow in the range from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has neither personality nor depth. Often, he comes across as an idiot. And unlovable for that. It prevents the mind from finding what Lindsey would find attractive about him. Compare the performance of Fallon with that of Firth in the English version, and you will understand how terribly flat, not fun and forced Ben of Fallon is and how wrong he is for this role. Watching Fallon in "Fever Pitch" makes Ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comic nuance be desired! <br /> <br /> Just as "High Fidelity" did, an Americanized "Fever Pitch" could have worked brilliantly. He just needed better writers, more competent directors and, of course, a stronger, more fun and more intelligent man. Do yourself a big favor: avoid this rotten movie; rent the English version of 1997 and read Hornby's book instead.
