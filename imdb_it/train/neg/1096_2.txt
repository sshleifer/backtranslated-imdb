While some training scenes were realistic, too many of them were military instructors like ex-Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the script were either anti-military types or wrote a film for that audience. <br /> <br /> I am a veterinarian from Viet Nam and, even during this period, military instructors who behaved in some of these probably would have remained in military jail. <br /> <br /> And I really liked the scene where the "hero" and his friend (both privates) are sitting in the Captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cursing with the captain as if was their friend. This sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose of the scene. <br /> <br /> Finally I asked myself, "What was this film about?" he seemed to wander everywhere without fire, except "I hate all authority". Thank God I got it from the library and I didn't pay to rent it.
