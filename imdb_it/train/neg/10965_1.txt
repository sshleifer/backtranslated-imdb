I'm actually watching this movie as I write this. . . If the following comments "show my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker", then so be it. . . <br /> <br /> But. . I thought (I'm still thinking how I'm currently looking) at this movie. . . to put it mildly, it is very, very overrated. Once again, a lot. <br /> <br /> It looks like a really bad student film made by someone with extremely limited resources. . . and those who have not paid much attention to details. <br /> <br /> I don't want to keep talking about all the different ways I find this movie lacking, but. . . well . . . I just don't understand (I remember, I fully admit that maybe it is ME who is the idiot here - not the director - for not getting this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented it on a whim because the reviews were really great. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
