Yes. I'll admit it. I believed all the hype surrounding this work, the trials and tribulations of 6 people who lived in Mexico City regarding their sex life. And so, I really expected to finally see a Mexican film (in age) that was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately the film was disappointing. History presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third person enters the life of each couple, their problems reach a crucial point. Or absolutely absurd. The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is patently stupid and childish (I imagine humor should have been). And everything goes from bad to worse. The exhibitions range from the good (Miss Zavaleta) to the mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his first work. However, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc., make the film fail. Miserably. SPYL had an (impressive) good reception at the box office. Believe that the hype is at your own risk.
