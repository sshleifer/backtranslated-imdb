First of all, this film is not a "thriller". Nor is it "compelling, tense". It may have been so based on the script, but the slowness of the direction makes it difficult to enter. <br /> <br /> The plot itself is very interesting and brilliant. Unfortunately, we only have an idea of ​​* how * ingenious after the image is finished. This leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with the music playing on them interspersed with action scenes that do not capture the viewer, and scenes of "cunning cleverness" that inject a little more evident intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller promised by the box. It would have been an exceptional film. Instead, Spike Lee made him advance along the end.
