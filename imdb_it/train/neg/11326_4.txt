This is one of two post-apocalyptic fantasy films made by Albert Pyun in 1993 - and he is the villain. Apparently all his energy came into "Nemesis" which was a fun non-stop action movie, and looks much more expensive. "Knights" is awkward and poor, a sci-fi on the bottom of the barrel that too often resembles a video game (new opponents jump out all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this film from the trash is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient combat machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at that time (58), I hope his stunt was well paid. (* 1/2)
