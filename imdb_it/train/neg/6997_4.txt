I saw it with a growing sense of unease. Why would God, in the form of Ian Hunter, help these particular people in an attempt to escape from the island of the devil? And what was he doing there in the first place? I mean, I know that God works in mysterious ways, but to help thieves and murderers and prostitutes to find redemption, forgiveness and change of heart in a place so forgotten by God ... In any case, it is a difficult film to accept. Whatever Gable had in terms of charm, missing in this portrait of a completely selfish man, Crawford is as captivating as ever for me, not at all, and the whole aspect of the film makes it seem like it was done as if it were done years before . Compared to contemporary films like "Stagecoach" and "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town", it seems prehistoric.
