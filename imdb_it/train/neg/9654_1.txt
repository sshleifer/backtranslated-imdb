The film is ugly. Simply terrible. Bollywood's bad movie series has no end! They must be running out of excuses to make films so horrible (or not). <br /> <br /> The problem seems to be mainly with the directors. This film has 2 good actors who have shown in the past to have the ability to offer great performances ... but they were headed so badly. Even the poor script didn't help. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of ridiculous moments and bad editing in the first half. For example: <br /> <br /> After his first big concert, Ajay Devgan, he meets Om Puri (from whom he fled about 30 years ago and talked about it again) and all the Om Puri are saying is staying beware of his friendship with Salman !!! What a load of shit. Seriously. Not to mention the baaad soundtrack. Whatever happened to Shankar Ehsaan Loy? <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgun is a total mixture of portraying a rock star. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace is good performance in the second half. Ajay shines as his character shows his dark side. So does Salman as the drug addict. <br /> <br /> Look at it maybe only for the last half hour.
