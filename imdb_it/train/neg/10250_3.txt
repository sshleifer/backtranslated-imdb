Shocking, economic and sci-fi science fiction, done with an almost total lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher messages from outer space is run by ONE MAN, and is VERY poorly guarded at night) and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but also offers one of his shows "I'm here strict for the money". (* 1/2)
