don't get sucked into renting this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from death row, despite the title (English). I can't think of one good thing to say about the movie. Poor acting, poor editing, poor direction ... a laughable "plot", and the sound / music was so irritating, it's a wonder that this movie doesn't have a warning label. The only possible way to sit in this film and enjoy it is its historical quality. They just don't make films that bad anymore.
