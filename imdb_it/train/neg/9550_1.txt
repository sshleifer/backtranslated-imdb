After Highlander 2 (to which I am still denied), I thought it was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so ugly. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this film is inaccurate with the details of the computer and the details of the original film. The original Wargames had at least some hacks that worked. Anyone who wrote this film didn't know ANYTHING OF COMPUTERS, except how to use a word processor. I doubt he even watched the original film. The acting is not even convincing. Please save yourself, under no circumstances watch this movie. I don't care if the channel is locked on the TV and you can't turn off the TV. THIS FILM WILL RULE YOUR LIFE.
