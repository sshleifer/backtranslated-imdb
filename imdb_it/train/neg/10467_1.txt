If there had ever been a call to make a bad movie that would reflect how stupid humanity could become, that would have taken the prize. The plot focuses on the Bible prophecies found in hidden scripture messages that push a group of thugs in search of power to try total control of the world. How stupid is this writer believing that people are actually? <br /> <br /> Acting was bad at best. Casper Van Dien has wasted his talent in making this film. Michael York's work was right for the role, since it was the center of the film, and he did a good job. <br /> <br /> This plot was disgusting and very disturbing. No tender or immature mind should see this film. This is how a basic plot against evil can go astray. <br /> <br /> There must be a lot of mental illnesses floating in movie circles, looking for ways to market this kind of junk. There must have been something censored to get a PG-13 rating, but it was still terrible.
