I noticed that this film has suffered the weight of many insults. He probably earned some, but it wasn't so bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I don't hate this movie, he tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film could work very well actually. I just think the filmmakers were wrong to write about which path to take when they did this (they should have added more fun parts if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a great movie. But like satire, it did not work in its current form - many scenes did not fit the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in history. However, it was not the worst independent film ever made - is it in the Top 10 worst? It is debatable.
