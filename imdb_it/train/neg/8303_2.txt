Since its release in 1983, "A Christmas Story", the story told by Jean Shepherd of his alter ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. "My Summer Story", however, still has Shepherd as a storyteller, but it has absolutely no charm and the characters are by no means close to the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> "My Summer Story" is basically a mixture of mediocre and simply not very interesting stories, which include the nearby hillbilly and battles. Charles Grodin, who I normally like, is extremely unpredictable in the role of the father (more appropriately played by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems to be forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor replacement for Ralphie, and the little brother is almost forgotten here. Only mom seems to have some value here and maybe it's because she fakes a movie manager with a gravy boat when she pushes her luck too far with angry housewives in "free dish night". <br /> <br /> The stories in this are mostly irrelevant and very thin. It can appeal to the extreme not excessive but as a sequel to "A Christmas Story", it is very poor and not worth it for most people. 2 out of 10.
