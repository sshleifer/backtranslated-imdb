One of the real clinkers of Boris Karloff. Essentially the dying Karloff (about 120 years older than him) is a scientist who needs money to finish his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco, where his funds are transferred from someone else, he goes to the south of France, where he works as a doctor, while trying to raise enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he made a deal with the rich young wife of a dying cotton baron. She will finance it if he helps her poison her husband so that he can take her money and continue with a gigolo (which I think is married). If you think I realized that you were wrong when you were watching the movie, I had to read what other people have written to understand. Why? because this movie made me lose two minutes. I had no idea what was going on with its many characters and multiple converging plot lines. Little is written and a lot is not said until the end, at which time I didn't really care. It is a macabre world of pure interest in Karloff's performance, sometimes quite strange. To be honest this is the only time I've seen him venture into the bizarre territory of Bela Lugosi. Not all the scenes, but few and I wonder how much they have spent.
