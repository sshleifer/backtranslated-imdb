This film reminded me of those "erotic thrillers". I used to stay up late and watch Cinemax when I was 13. I would label this softer film, since there is not only a bump and a simulated grinder. There is, however, a lot of nudity - the opening scene is in a strip club, we see Kester Hodder's keester (or at least a stunt) and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a naked female werewolf that appears to have assaulted the Munster for a costume. 13-year-olds rejoice. <br /> <br /> Beyond that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I've seen in years. The shots look like FMV from the Resident Evil video game in terms of quality. The wolf is too ugly to explain and, despite the poor quality of the suit, it is shown too many times. <br /> <br /> Plot and acting don't make sense. There is a strange past history of werewolves and hybrid werewolves - the Darkwolf is the second, but from what I can tell hybrids it does the same thing that all werewolves do - it looks human, wolves and kills people. The Darkwolf is trying to find a companion, but strangely he can't find his partner but he can sniff whoever he touches. Once again, this ability proves to be of little use since the Darkwolf ends up killing several people whose target has never touched, met or even seen as best I can. The partner does not know that he is a werewolf and is fighting the transformation or something. <br /> <br /> You would think it would be difficult to fool a simple movie of monsters like this but, well, they did. You want a low-end quality werewolf, go for rent Dog soldiers want a lot of T&A this is your movie.
