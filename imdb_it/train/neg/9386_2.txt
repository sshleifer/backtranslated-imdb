In many films that I have seen Warren Oates, I have come to a definite conclusion, here is a talented individual. I first saw Mr. Oates in the 1960s television series called Stoney Burke. From that moment on, I closely followed his career and felt he was destined for great roles. This happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him the best salary in a film entitled "Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia". Of course, his biggest fame claim was his magnificent role in "The Wild Bunch". I always thought he was capable enough to bring a certain magic to any character, that is until I saw him on this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the iron fist detectives of the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because, the synopsis said it was a hard-nosed private eye, it immediately interested me. However, I sat patiently throughout the film and discovered that it was a boring, disinterested, slow-paced, twisted and confused saga that if it had a theme or a storyline it must have been left in a dark self. Collectively and with some of the best Hollywood stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this film has had enough power to reach Mach five, however, it has vanished on the launchpad and has not gone where is it. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a poor quality vehicle that never took off. **
