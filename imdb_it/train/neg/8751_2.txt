How can you get Disney? Rich and caring girls behave like idiots, buy a lot of stuff and learn a lesson. Is Disney trying to teach a lesson to herself? That maybe he should still be human while he buys everything? Whatever the psychoanalysis, this film has been sucked. <br /> <br /> Girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then the money disappears and they have to use their wealth to make the milk factories (yes, milk) employ employees. They keep it afloat until dad comes home. And the man at the beginning, who seems to be the one who takes the money, is the only one. But the ending is stupid. Webcams in the Cayman Islands? Eh? My time is never worth more. <br /> <br /> But it's better than Howl's Moving Castle. "D-"
