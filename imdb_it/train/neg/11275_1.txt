This is a real "LOCK STOCK" clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many great British actors have signed up for this junk, they must have been corrupt. A lost game of a plot goes on forever and if I had not paid a good price, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. It is not the worst film I have ever seen, that honor goes to the really pathetic bramoll used in a film "(I use the term freely" GUMMO "(I want to denounce that so-called" director "for the lost hour and half of my life) but this garbage is almost right there with it. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Things like this remind Hollywood that they don't have the monopoly of truly horrible movies.
