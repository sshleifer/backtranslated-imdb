I was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the Oscar for best film of 2009 and so went to see The Hurt Locker. unfortunately, all I got for the two hours invested was the sad confirmation that this film had won awards exclusively for reasons out of the screen. <br /> <br /> the direction and visual style of this film are among the weakest you'll ever see. when he is not busy being yet another Bourne Identity tribute with the terrible and annoying visual "cam", he shows all the distinctive signs of a second-level daytime soap opera in terms of goals. <br /> <br /> the "plot" is worn out, the characterizations are as developed as the Beetle Bailey comic book ideas rejected and the dialogue - in cases where the film refuses to be "minimalist" and for no apparent reason transforms one or two soldiers in the right chat - it's a bit of the worst ever recorded. in all honesty, the actors do the best they can in these circumstances, simply not enough to obscure how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> the whole film has the feeling that it is intended as a kind of "mockumentary" that timed was lacking in humor and therefore re-edited as best they could in order to pass it on as a serious drama. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours in this film, you will never have to go back and spend two hours wasting your time for the rest of your life.
