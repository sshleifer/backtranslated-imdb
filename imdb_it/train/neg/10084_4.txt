This film was fine, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born that way", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and simply fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems that Kate's gender preferences turn on and off like a switch, making this movie a bit simplistic. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, as is common with films that try to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the movie who had questions or disapproval of the gay lifestyle were labeled "bigots". And there was no happy medium. Either Kate's friends and relatives have totally embraced her or totally avoided her. This is not typical of the interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect without necessarily condone the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film showed none of these types of interactions. For a film that tries to interpret tolerance and acceptance, it struck me as a very intolerant film! Then in the end, Kate apparently decides after all these years that she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what it means to be gay actually? Come on!
