WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. Richard Burton / Elizabeth Taylor's roadshow arrives in Sardinia and links up with the artistic director Joseph Losey for this incredibly ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich and dying widow clinging to her servants on an island where she loudly mentions her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When the scoundrel Burton introduces himself as a poet and an old friend, Taylor realizes that his time is up. Ludicrioso in the extreme --- it is difficult to determine whether Taylor and Burton are misbehaving or whether Williams intended to make their characters so unattractive. If so, then acting is brilliant! Burton mumbles his jokes, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screams at her. It's really horrible. So Noel Coward is Taylor's confidant, the "witch of Capri". <br /> <br /> Presumably BOOM talks about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves --- two standard Williams themes, but it is so badly addressed by Losey, that Taylor and Burton have not explained for the public during their mostly insignificant monologues, any substance in the film would have been completely diluted. <br /> <br /> BOOM has an extraordinary photograph --- the camera should have been out of focus to ruin the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast includes Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli in the role of Taylor's ingenious doctor and Michael Dunn in the role of her ugly dwarf security guard ... both he and her dogs make a number on Burton!
