Sometimes I will rent an action / adventure film just like a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important. This is why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality film, but it makes me laugh and lets me relax for a while. One of these days I'll probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and some Monty Python movies for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something like a badly written episode of Xena, and the acting of Kathy Long was very community theater (not bad for a professional kick boxer and an amateur actress). There were some highlights from the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get actors pretty good at playing bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die damn fast. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts films, the more you enter the film, the more emphasis there is on action, and the plot (which was not strong at first) deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting. However, the more he fights Kathy Long, the more time the director dedicates to his backside. At the end of the film I was seriously thinking of watching it a second time only to count the number of times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were in the center of the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was not enough meat for this film to make the curiosity satisfying that it is worth seeing the film a second time. If you are a passionate Xena fan who needs something to devote to a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend the 0.50 cents on the rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect anything but being slightly amused for a few hours. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, you like the derri√®re of Kathy Long. THEN you may want to purchase a copy.
