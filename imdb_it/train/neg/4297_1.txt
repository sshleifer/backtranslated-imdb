I wake up suddenly, aware that I'm drooling over the plastic bedspread, and I realize it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I hit my head? Or do you accidentally swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxations? Could it be adult narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I stopped temporarily on Cheap Seats while browsing the channel, and the incredible lack of humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I obscured it. <br /> <br /> It is so shaking of the head, open mouth, bravado at the shoulders. But I have to give credit to these moral and boring twins for selling this idea. Maybe they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive they had on me, and when they woke up, some horrendous episodes were already in the jar and he / she was hoping that since all the spectators have fallen asleep, no one will now horrible and will be able to maintain the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been notified.
