Until the last 20 minutes, I was thinking that this is perhaps the worst film by Jackie Chan (excluding his pre-1978 work, which I am not familiar with). The last sequence of combat has changed everything: it is long, good and intense, indeed, one of the highlights of Chan's career. But to get to it, you have to go through a lot of "comedy" that could amuse five-year-olds (oh, look! Someone threw a tomato in front of that boy) and endless scenes of "football". Not to mention dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - look to find out what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth being rented for the final fight alone, but the rest of the film is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films.
