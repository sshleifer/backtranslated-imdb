How disgusting! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this film was a very direct story of a man who had already died and was driving through purgatory. The original film had a lot to say and didn't bend over backwards to say it. And he had a naked girl on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version strikes me as something that a producer has purchased the rights and then abandoned for lack of interest. It seems that a group of people deliberately decided to adapt it to the nineties and changed ethnicity and gender just to be nice. The film is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a final act of challenge. It's about a man trying to get to the hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason why this movie was made other than to make me angry ...
