John Wayne and Albert Dekker compete for oil rights in the Indian territory, and for Martha Scott's attention in this Republic Pictures film shot in Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting genre western because of its characters and its more modern environment, with Wayne and Dekker interpreting the old and new factions of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis who co-writes the script with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell directs as a man of work that suits his career. A rather banal story is actually saved by its third final, where fortunately the action resumes and we are treated to something that looks like an impulse. The light approach to the romantic line is not entirely correct, and a glorious fight between the two protagonists is ruined by the fact that Rogell is not able to mask the stuntmen who do the work. But hey, the stuntmen always deserve their moment of glory. The solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual they have a lot of charisma on the screen, especially when they launch his gun. But despite its better than usual Republican budget, it remains a film of interest only for Wayne fans of the 1940s. 4/10
