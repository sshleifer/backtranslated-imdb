Amateur in the extreme. The work with the camera is particularly complicated: camera operators do not have to go around ALL THE TIME. <br /> <br /> The script is really crazy, and the acting is even worse. In addition, the plot is disjointed and tortuous - with some holes in the logic. At one point the protagonist wants to be thrown into prison to deal with suspected Al-Quada agents, and then get an interview with Osama. I found the story quite incredible as a result of so many flaws. The role of "director / protagonist" actually depicts a rude and idiotic boy. The only element of interest is that the filmmakers filmed on the spot. It is really a shame to have wasted the opportunity to do something interesting. <br /> <br /> Who financed this shit?
