Interesting film about a real event that occurred during the civil war in Vermont. He kept my attention to the end and I don't regret having seen it. I've never read anything about this raid incident, so I was curious to see if the rebels took it away. I like historical films from that era. <br /> <br /> My main problem concerns the Confederate currencies. They look too beautiful !!! Sometimes acting was a little stiff. I like the old man who ate mashed potatoes because he had no teeth. The wounded soldier who was playing with a hunting dog was a bit strange. Overall, it was a downhill movie.
