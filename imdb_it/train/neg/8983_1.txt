Ulises is a literature teacher who arrives in a coastal city. There, he will fall in love with Martina, the most beautiful girl in the city. They will start a torrid love story that will end with the tragic death of Ulises on the sea. A few years later, Martina married Sierra, the richest man in the city and lives a peaceful happy life surrounded by money. One day, the appearance of Ulises will increase her passion and act without thinking about the consequences. The plot is pretty absurd and none of the actors play a decent part. Moreover, three quarters of the film are sexual acts, which, although well taken up, are rather tiring, since we want to see a further development of the story. It's just a bad Bigas Luna movie, with lots of sex, no stupid arguments and characters anywhere.
