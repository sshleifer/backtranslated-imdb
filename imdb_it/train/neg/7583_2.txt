David Lean's worst film. Even 'In Which We Serve' was not as bad as this. Usually a film with a good reputation like this, has at least some redeeming qualities, which makes it clear why it could be considered a classic. But after looking at it I just couldn't understand why this piece of shit had so much fun even in 1945! I didn't like acting, the stiff upper lip British mannerisms, the story, the script (which can be quite funny at times but totally unattractive) and the soundtrack. The character of Elvira is conceivable to be charming and attractive, but in reality it was ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another film that convinced me not to trust a movie's reputation. Another very overrated "English classic".
