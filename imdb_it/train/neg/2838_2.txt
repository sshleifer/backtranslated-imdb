Skip the mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took Living Legend parts 1 and 2 and locked them into a plot with the horrible Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica has suffered from network-controlled writing and lack of time to prepare for adequate production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, by itself, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, look at Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between the science fiction produced by the net and syndicated science fiction.
