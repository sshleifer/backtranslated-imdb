I suppose any novel is as depressing as Moby Dick would find much favor in Depression-era audiences who had enough of their problems. But any resemblance to Herman Melville's classic novel is pure coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the film is a prequel to the main story, as we know it, not that it has been preserved too much for the film. First we meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother) as a happy and fortunate soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett, daughter of Father Mapple. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, wants to marry Bennett too. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in a top performance. Barrymore had not mastered the cinema of sound enough and succumbed with all the histrionics of the silent era plus a stage voice that would shake the beams of any cinema to which this film was playing. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab losing his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I must say that the amputation scene was rather macabre. Of course this was all before the Code. However, I'm sure the 1930s crowd shuddered. <br /> <br /> After that the story of Ahab hunting the whale that he thinks made him unpleasant in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no female characters in Moby Dick as he wrote. <br /> <br /> One of the things that Melville did was invest the Ahab ship team, the Pequod, with personality. In addition to Queequeg, the cannibal harpooner, there are names, but not personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs could also be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would see this version of Moby Dick strictly out of curiosity and nothing else.
