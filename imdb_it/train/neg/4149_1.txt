Dear me. Where do I start? Dad is nowhere old enough to be the girl's father. Corbetta on camera in the first 5 minutes of the film. The favorite exclamation in this film is "Jesus Christ !!!". The zombies are agile, stupid and few and far between. The reasons are absolutely incomprehensible and a narrative does not exist. People rush to their destination in jeeps driven at 3 km / h. It seems that the world is proceeding normally but these should be the final days. The breasts appear for the taste of the breast. Normally such an approach would provide some ransom, but the rest of the film really made me uninterested in the breast or the future of humanity. There is a dog with no reason and thin, orange blood that makes the stomach turn. The general and his "Shut the f ** k up!" it is the only saving characteristic. For the rest, I sincerely hope to hear that they did the right thing and killed themselves.
