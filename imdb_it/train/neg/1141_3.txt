Having low expectations, the new opening movie (clocked at over five minutes) on "Husbands" was a pleasant surprise. I will not say that the new video was a grade A material, but it provided a very solid basis for what "could have been" a good original film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a one-day shooting period. After the new movie, Jules White has decided to make a simple pushpin of images from "Brideless Groom" in this short, making the transition of the story not exactly smooth, that Jules and Felix Adler try to remedy with a small piece of new film to the end, giving us the old, worn-out final of the boys (Moe & Larry in this case) fired in the ass. <br /> <br /> 3/10
