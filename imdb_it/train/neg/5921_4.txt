What exactly was happening during the Second World War in New Zealand when there were American forces? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to see. Can you imagine playing Joan Fontaine as Sandra Dee's older sister? Fontaine looked more like his mother. Even more fun is that Fontaine gets pregnant in the film. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such great chemistry on screen 4 years later in "The Hustler", have no scenes together in this film. Laurie plays another sister who goes to Wellington to wander there, despite being married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. Jean Simmons is a widow and finds love with Paul Newman very submissive. There is also romance for the young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The image has little or no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is right in love and in war? If they are, they did a terrible job selling this. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly eliminated. This is what should have been done quickly in this terribly disappointing 1957 film.
