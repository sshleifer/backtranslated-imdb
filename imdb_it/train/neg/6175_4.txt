Was it a thriller, as I thought when I saw the cover of the video library? No. Was it a "thoughtful food" as perhaps the author was trying to make it? Not exactly. So what was it? It was a very mediocre film, which had great potential, and was well directed but disappointed by a confusing story with no strengths, beginning in the middle and end, with a mediocre acting expected by the serial killer, who although he seemed too zealous in some places delivered the best cast performance in general. It was a beautiful photograph, with beautiful colors, fantastic hi-tec things, beautiful scenery but it leaves you lost on where it is going and where it has just been. And with the feeling of wrapping it quickly at the end. OK to see if there's nothing else on TV.
