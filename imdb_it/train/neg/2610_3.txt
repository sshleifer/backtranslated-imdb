102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I was not a fan of the previous episode and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a stupid stuffed storyline, a terrible interpretation of Glenn Close, which sums up all the scenes as if they were playing for his own fun and the incredibly boring and uninteresting main actors. Once again dogs are the only "actors" that seem "real" and this is a trait. Another effort wasted here. GRADE: D
