I couldn't wait to do this tour, and I was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I enjoy the roller coasters and amusement park rides very easily. <br /> <br /> The roller coaster part was okay - and this was all about 30 seconds of a 90 second lap. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> He was desperately trying to be like a mixture of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain and Disneyland, and failed in every respect. <br /> <br /> It wasn't exciting or exciting at least.
