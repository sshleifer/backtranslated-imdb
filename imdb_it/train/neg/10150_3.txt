Humphrey Bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and had to play a Mexican part or be suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Presumably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried a sequel with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, like Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh and the ubiquitous John Litel, but they have made the huge mistake of trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really do bad things, because he has shown one thing, and that is he can't sing. The story wasn't so bad, but even with Bogie clearly baffled, it turned out to be a poor western that was too long, and on a low budget, but in all honesty, the color wouldn't help.
