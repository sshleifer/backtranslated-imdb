Three Russian aristocrats absorb the decadence of Montecarlo, despite the fact that they have fallen to their last franc. To support their lavish lifestyle, the three use the services of a counterfeiter and use banknotes in casinos, hoping to exchange the fake coin for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, a US envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen, and the three decide to make friends with the visitors, hoping for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, plans to go further, with a continuous advance towards Elena, while disappointing the count's maid, who loves Sergius. In the end, the circumstances play against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim was trying to convey a message (with the madness of American women and the misbehavior of the aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the film can really bore the modern public, like me, easily doing it. Even the acting, which is great following EvS as Greed and the March wedding, is just a run of the mill here. The film could have used improvements at various levels. Evaluation, 3.
