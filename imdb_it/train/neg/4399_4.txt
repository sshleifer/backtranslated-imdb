"Tapeheads", a travesty, intermittent and entertaining parody of the music video business, may have been the perfect comedy short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly swinging the meaningless chaos. Two semi-expert security guards in Los Angeles are playing starting their company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties and a deathbed star. It is a pity that the filmmakers had to invent a dark plot for the time of execution (cheating that involves a crooked politician and his henchmen who does not do much except take away the main force of the film, bringing into play the musical culture of the late 80s) . Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerds but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys have the same wave nut, and they never got down. They are the real things about comedies. * 1/2 from ****
