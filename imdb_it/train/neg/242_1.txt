From an elaborate plot plot that has almost no sense the bad dialogue and the disconnected scenes up to the extreme downer, to bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) "Finding John Christmas" is better to let go. Ms. Bertinelli's performance lacks depth or emotion, as do her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as a love interest for Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch and even less listen to the song. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's screenplay is at its most youthful. <br /> <br /> Every year at this time I look for TV guides and look forward to seeing some of the classic Christmas movies and inspirational holidays appear on the small screen. Films such as "Miracle on 34th Street", the delightful "The shop around the corner" by Ernst Lubitsch and, of course, the 1951 version of "Scrooge". There are Frank Capra classics "It's a wonderful life" and "Meet John Doe". Hey, forget the classics. What about "Home Alone" or "Home for the Holidays" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /> <br /> My gift to you is advice. Your time would be better spent searching for these films than finding "Find Christmas at Christmas". Merry Christmas!
