This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, but I didn't even expect this stuff. To start with, the corners of the camera work against you in this game. The bike is your means of moving. The bike is the worst part of the game. Every time you come across something, you stop there and don't move. Never fall off your bike or wreck for that matter. The main character barely speaks, even if he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. Pedal through the trees on your bike. The camera makes it impossible to fight the enemy. This game would not even be worth renting.
