I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and I loved the movie so much - even "not moved" - that I decided to watch the entire "Deathstalker" movie series. I bought I and II and settled for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Nothing on "Deathstalker I" was fun at any level and when the titles were pulled I was embarrassed and sorry I bought it! Too much ugliness and nudity. I suppose "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or that the MST3K was really very modified because I was expecting something similar, that is stupid, carefree and simple. I was wrong. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I haven't even opened "DS 2" as I will return it tomorrow. Now I probably throw this DVD away because I can't return it and nobody wants it - including myself! So really, don't worry about it. Even nudity (a lot of things like that) is uninteresting and icky.
