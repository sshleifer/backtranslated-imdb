No, I'm just kidding. It was horrible. <br /> <br /> I was watching my local sci-fi station last night, which plays movies, every night, with a monthly theme. This month is "Space Turkeys, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Bombs". Such bad films should never have been made. This was a good selection. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is absolutely horrible with two exceptions, the gore trick (which showed potential) and editing (which slightly did the rest of the film, in terms of being horrible) . The acting is horrible everywhere, the dialogue is horrible, the script, the direction. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two forms of special effects, gore and archive footage of the space. I will focus on blood. Watching this movie, I thought to myself, "What was the motivation behind the making of this film?" People like to do stuff, sure, but I was hesitant to think that anything good could have happened to anyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this film was made as a means to increase the boy's Demo Reel of make-up effects. He (Rick Baker) actually started a very nice career, he worked on STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996), and also THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981), plus a number of other noteworthy films. On top of that, I can't say I've ever really seen a real man who melts live - incredible, or otherwise - but I should say that this seemed to be a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> Now, when I think of bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone talks on the phone and then, in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps behind him, or something like that. This film really serves to highlight the fact that bad editing can take many forms. In particular, scenes that are too long and absolutely useless. Most of the scenes dragged on longer than they should have, from a little dead air to that crazy crazy scene with Cleaver Girl. And that head cut off in the river, the head is thrown into a river (in slow motion), the film continues for a couple of minutes, and then we return to the floating head and watch a waterfall fall. While I'm sure they were all very proud of their severed head, WHAT THE HELL ???????????????????????????? The slow jerky movement tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion originally, but later decided they "didn't work that way" and then slowed it down. Oy Vey. In any case, if you ever see another film in which a hysterical fat woman runs down a hall and then directly through a closed glass door - all in slow motion, mind you - remember THE INCREDIBLE FALSE MAN, to * this * is where it all started. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are best seen at home with a group of friends. This is a little slow most of the time, but this is just the time to invent your lines. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty damn bad.
