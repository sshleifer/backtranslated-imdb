This had high intellectual pretensions. The main protagonist is to give a "deep" "significant" rendering (with a voice for his mental thoughts in a natural way) and was certainly influenced by the "method" of the Fifties / Sixties, which, when the script and the direction it was useful gave amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here the plot is abysmal. Also, it moves too slowly, you can change at least 20 minutes - including unnecessary flashbacks - and the plot wouldn't change. Sometimes, it is very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his character "Uncle" and his portrait often borders on parody. An interesting side is only touched: the boy / hero relationship - if we admit that the hero is himself a bit of a child - When he tells the boy that he would not let anyone hurt him, a certain tenderness emerges. But it is messed up and only the final scene returns to it. <br /> <br /> Word to the wise: Take instead "at close range" of Foley: he has two great actors (Christoph er Walken and Sean Penn together!), it is also an unusual film, but it is compelling, full of suspense . Here my hitchcockometer points neatly towards zero everywhere.
