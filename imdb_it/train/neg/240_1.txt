I never like to comment on a good movie, but when it's a bad movie, I really have to try. Speaking of Vivah, this boy, Sooraj Badjatya, seems to have completely lost him. After the success of Hum Aapke Hain Kaun, he thought he could make money with poor marriage videos. Vivah is so rough that Badjatyas left Johars and Chopras behind. <br /> <br /> There was not a single moment during the movie where I can say "Oh! at least this is good". Aloknath does clich√© in a role of Girl's father, Shahid kapoor seems fat and Shahrukhed, Amrita rao is another disaster besides ugly-looking sets, poor costumes, hackneyed plot, monstrous stepmother, difficult actors to perform, cacophonous background music , cheap soundtracks. <br /> <br /> Now the spoiler, I warn you guys that, as happens in all his other films, after a calamitous incident film ends with a happy note.
