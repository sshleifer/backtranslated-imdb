Expectations were a bit high for me when I went to see this movie, after all I thought that Steve Carell could not have been wrong by coming out of great films like Anchorman, The 40 Year-Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Guys, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I will start with what is right with this film: in some places Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell. There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh, and it's almost entirely due to the fact that he was given the room to do his thing. He is undoubtedly a talented individual, and it is a pity that he signed for what turned out to be, in my opinion, a total disaster. <br /> <br /> With the one out of the way, I'll talk about what went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Dan Burns, a widower with three girls who is considered to be a national syndicate consultancy column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his close relatives gather for some time with each other. <br /> <br /> The family is at the top of the list of things that make this movie terrible. No family behaves this way. It's almost as if they were transported from Pleasantville or left in Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think is a family when we are 7 years old. It reaches the point where they become hateful and simply frustrating. It touches football, crossword games, family bowling and talented shows ARE NOT LIKE THE CUSTOMER. It's almost nauseating. <br /> <br /> Another major flaw is the woman Carell should be in love with. Watching it in its first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine should be unique and original in this woman is slightly delayed. <br /> <br /> It makes me think that this film takes place on another planet. I left the theater wondering what I just saw. After thinking further, I don't think it was much.
