I rented I CURIOUS-YELLOW AM from my video store because of all the controversy surrounding it when it was first released in 1967. I also heard that it was initially seized by US customs if it ever tried to enter this country so being a fan of films considered "controversial", I really had to see it alone. <br /> <br /> The plot focuses on a young Swedish student named Lena who wants to learn everything she can about life. In particular, he wants to focus his attention on making a sort of documentary about what the average Swede has thought about certain political issues such as the Vietnam War and race issues in the United States. In the midst of asking the politicians and ordinary inhabitants of Stockholm about their opinions on politics, he has sex with his theater teacher, classmates and married men. <br /> <br /> What kills me of I AM CURIOSO-GIALLO is 40 years ago, this was considered pornographic. Really, the sex and nudity scenes are few and far between, even if it is not filmed as cheap porn. While my peasant mind finds it shocking, in reality sex and nudity are a staple in Swedish cinema. Even Ingmar Bergman, probably their answer to good old John Ford, did sex scenes in his films. I thank the filmmakers for the fact that any sex shown in the film is shown for artistic purposes only to shock people and make money to be shown in pornographic theaters in America. I AM CURIOUS-YELLOW is a good movie for anyone who wants to study meat and potatoes (without puns) of Swedish cinema. But in reality, this film doesn't have much plot.
