First of all there was really nothing in this film that really grabbed me. It wasn't a bad movie, just another movie where I said "Well, it was nothing special" after seeing it. There was probably drama and stuff like that, but it just didn't catch me, but more semi-opaque. As I said in the title, it was very cheap in a sense. The quality of the film itself (the images) was of poor quality and reminded me more of a cheap movie for a TV movie than a very respectable English filmmaker. The shots and shots were very amateur as in my opinion. Actually I didn't have close-up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. I have not seen many English films and the ones I have seen have not really impressed me more than this and have presented a sort of similar fact done with camera work, colors and so on. "Game" tried to be cooler, more fashionable and smarter (see my review of "Lola Rennt" on this, if you wish), but it didn't succeed for me either. Overall just a slightly indifferent film that was nothing special (at best, I'm afraid) and basically unfortunately more than two hours wasted.
