I confess: Emma, ​​in my opinion, is the single largest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is at best a schedule. <br /> <br /> Comparison with Gwyneth Paltrow's version is inevitable - that version is much more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and much more pleasant to look at. <br /> <br /> There are some good elements here - Kate Berkinsale (having already played Flora Poste on Cold Comfort Farm, clearly the most intelligent spiritual twin of Emma) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard creates a properly decorative Frank Churchill. The production is beautiful, but the interiors are too dark. <br /> <br /> However, there are many important problems. The first is Mark Strong - first of all, it doesn't seem fair to Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role of a Victorian and censored pastor. He is very out of tune. <br /> <br /> The second problem is in length. Simply put, the film is too short - to have the right feeling, it should be double. <br /> <br /> Finally, and significantly, there is the quality of adaptation. Austen is the dream of an adapter: all dialogue is already there. It just needs to be pruned and properly placed. Andrew Davies seems to think differently. First of all, this is a rather gloomy film, and the last thing Emma should be is dark. More significantly, Davies considered it appropriate to rewrite the ending as a sort of bucolic festival. From what planet or minor work of Thomas Hardy does this come from? It is completely out of style and the spirit of the novel. And I think it's extremely presumptuous to try to improve - perfection. <br /> <br /> Watch the Paltrow version or watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
