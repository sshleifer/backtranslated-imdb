Such an ugly film should be picked up from all stores around the world. So full of boring, boring and unimaginative characters, and with a leading character with such an annoying attitude and a dry voice that constantly gives a carefree voice for every action and feeling, this film holds the record for the most challenging film I've ever seen. Since I paid money to own it, I felt the need to see it and regret it. My head hurts everywhere because of the terribly boring characters and their useless lives of fewer lives. A group of kids who know nothing, are all cold and worst of all, they have terrible dialogues everywhere, they just mull over when the main character tries to have a date with the girl. Boring, so much so that my friend was trembling with hatred and I was red from the embarrassment I had thrown away. The DVD was on eBay the following day, and I didn't earn much of my money. Avoid like the plague.
