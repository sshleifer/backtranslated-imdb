"A Town Called Hell" (aka "A Town Called Bastard"), a British / Spanish co-production, was created in the wake of Clint Eastwood's success in the made-in-Italy trilogy "Man With No Name". The model used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and doubled their voices. This film is no exception except for the fact that they also used some British actors. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to summarize the plot, but here it goes. The story opens with rebels or others, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau who break into a church and kill everyone inside, including the priest. We advance quickly towards the city in question some years later, where the character of Shaw is masquerading as a priest. The mayor of the city (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who thinks of nothing with his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw in the mix a grieving widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) who is looking for her killer husband. Add to this the fact that she rides in a hearse that lies dead like a coffin because God knows why. After the mayor was murdered by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri) the city is invaded by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I'm sorry but the name escapes me). The colonel takes control of the city and begins to summarily execute citizens to force them to reveal the identity of the leader. <br /> <br /> Even if they opened the film side by side, it is difficult to understand from the dialogue that the characters of Landau and Shaw know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. It does and .............................................. < br /> <br /> I'm sure the presidents regretted making this film. My dreaded "1" vote is simply horrible and well deserved. Shaw spends most of the movie staring at anyone who is within reach. Even Landau cannot save this film. Even the beautiful Mrs. Stevens is completely wasted. Having just released "The ballad of Cable Hogue" by Peckinpah the previous year, I found it strange that she appeared in this chaos of a movie. Savalas has made many of these images ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) during the pre-Kojak period. Michael Craig is also somewhere like a character called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey has appeared in many of these "westerns", although he would have emerged to play the villain in the two films "French Connection". Al Lettieri will also come out with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and will move on to other memorable roles before his premature death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the version I was watching was only 88 minutes long that the longest time of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb, however I can't see where 7 or 8 more minutes would make much difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
