Maybe I'm really getting old, but I missed this completely and the old Funny Bone completely. Surely there must be something very wrong with this Irishman (it's me, Schultz!). Lordy, sir, what would I give to see the light! First, the manic energy, the wit and the drive of Phil Silvers were an integral part of comic education and general education of life, if you will. Although it is possible that the series, entitled "YOU WILL NEVER GET" (1955-59 *), could have gotten someone else in the CBS TV Network's main role as sergeant. Bilko, it is very difficult to imagine another actor / comedian in the world wearing the sergeant-major's stripes. <br /> <br /> Such a strong identification is inevitable, even if not the same kind of demolition of the career of a nightmare that has revealed itself to other guys, like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ( "THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN") and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> One of the main obstacles to the successful adaptation and updating of a work from 1950 on the TV screen until the 90s. The audience that comes out of the cinema is our collective memory. Without being sure of what percentage of the crowd he remembered the character of Bilko in seeing the original race and the first revivals of the syndication, and their number was certainly considerable; even a large segment of young people had seen replicas of Bilko in recent times. It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles; or even light years apart. <br /> <br /> So, to avoid being considered an old fool all square, please consider some other points. <br /> <br /> Right here today, the 14th day of November in the Year of Our Lord 2007, let me swear and affirm under oath that I was a fan of Steve Martin for almost 30 years, moreover, I appreciated the wit and talent of Bilko's 96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and the late Phil Hartman. After all, they were the talents of guys like this and many others, "NBC; s Saturday NIGHT" and "SECOND CITY TV" Alumni that made the last quarter of the twentieth century laugh. But a reworking of BILKO; it simply didn't click. <br /> <br /> Maybe if the film was made as a service comedy (they always liked it!) but without the names of Bilko Show and giving it some self-identity it would be more appreciated by grumpy old people like me. <br /> <br /> So, we've already had so many series of sitcoms and cartoons turned into movies lately, what are the prospects? Howse about someone doing Hal Roach's World War II army sergeant comedy series DOUBLEDAY & AMES and the first "CRUSADER RABBIT" TV cartoon series? Remember where you heard it before! POOLLE SCHNITZ!
