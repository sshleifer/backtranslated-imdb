This episode of Masters of Horror was terrible. Apparently, Mr. Carpenter needs to learn a thing or two about rhythm and decent and plausible dialogue. There have been times when I literally shouted on TV for something to happen. Maybe he thinks he's creating suspense, but Carpenter needs to cut that overly simplified musical score of his (or his son's) and move the action forward a little. How many times the girl said "Oh no, I can't have this baby!" and "Oh, no here comes"? Carpenter takes elements from much better films (Assault on Precinct 13 and The Thing) and projects them here as if we were to recognize and appreciate his brand style. What is missing here is genuine suspense and energy. It is as if he had sleepwalking during the film making process. <br /> <br /> For Carpenter's best films, follow the tried and true classics - The Thing, Halloween, and They Live. For the best masters of horror episodes, take a look at my favorites: Family, Jenifer and Dreams in the Witch House.
