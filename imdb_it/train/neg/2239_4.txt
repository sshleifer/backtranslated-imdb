The plot has already been described by other reviewers, so I'll simply add that the reason I wanted to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all her unquestionable glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake must be one of the sexiest and most beautiful examples of "posh totty" that have been entrusted to celluloid. Of his age and his age, only the equally exquisite Jane Asher approaches. What were the actresses with their musical brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) For those like me who admired Gabrielle, her scenes in this film will not disappoint. He has a magnificent figure and nothing is left to the imagination here. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very poor and at the same time, very cheap. The song that covers the opening titles seems to go on forever and it's horrible.
