I chose this because the music was made by Hans Zimmer, a customer of modular Metasonix synthesizers (produced by someone dear to me). The art of the jacket says "the 2003 version". <br /> <br /> I give him a point for a strong woman, a point for cheezy dialogue and a last point for Meg Foster's blue eyes, of which there are many shots of. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see David MacCullum casually swimming (the pool has a plexiglass viewing window!), while his beloved was chased by a psychopath in Greece. <br /> <br /> The sets were marginally impressive, ie the houses of the rich in L.A. and Mendanassos (sp?), where the castle was. I found myself wondering how they were able to keep clean with all the dust that blew around. The wind was not violent enough to be credible for me. I kept thinking that animal skins on furniture had to be bad ... etc. and I realized that the film must be pretty boring if I'm wondering about these things when the alleged plot was taking place. I ran into things like that, why did he light the fire, turning off the game, then throwing the game into the fire ?! Stupid stuff like that It was at its most awkward. Oh good. Robert Morely had a little fun with his bizarre geezer character and a nice vacation out of it.
