First of all, we all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor, barely even, sometimes just bad. Anyway, in this piece of @ *! ^ Called SnakeEater, the film industry as a whole sank. <br /> <br /> First, let's start with the plot. A Vietnam veteran, Jack Kelly, known as Soldier (who should be as hard as a leather strap and then a bit, which can be believed when he sticks nails through the feet of two boys and puts them on the floor), is to know that his family was killed and his sister kidnapped. So he goes on a solitary mission to save his sister. It had some potential, but still rather thin to begin with. <br /> <br /> Now, the acting. Being an actor myself, I am qualified to say that this was one of the worst acting in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is, well, himself. The jackasses that play the Clampets / Deliverance scraps should be tuned and fired for their so-called performances that offend actors around the world, especially the talented ones who never get their big chance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the action. The shooting is so-so at BEST, and fighting with fists is regrettable. I saw more real fights at the Renaissance Festival (and those were really fake)! <br /> <br /> Readers, listen to me: AVOID THIS CACA PIECE AT ALL COSTS! IF IT WAS THE ONLY FILM IN EXISTENCE, YOU WANT TO EVEN WANT TO AVOID IT! For your brain cell count, DO NOT watch this thing!
