I will keep this brief; thanks to Greg for helping me to say it briefly: imprisonment speaks of a boy who drugs a girl's drink, imprisons her and tortures her, then goes into captivity to have sex with her. This is the only turning point in the film. It's a torture like rape in slow motion. And it's not even a good movie. It's not so bad it's good; It's just bad. <br /> <br /> It must also be said that among the critics there is a "spoiler code" that they dare not break, although some have been tempted about this because it is so vile. Because nobody had the courage to come forward and say, "this is garbage, and that's the reason", it's beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't give your money to these poop street vendors.
