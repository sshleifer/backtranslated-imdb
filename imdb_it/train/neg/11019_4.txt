Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even with regards to film directors B, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his best films. Yes, slaughter the great story of Poe 'Sepature Burial' and yes, it has a fickle and irregular rhythm, but it's also quite fun. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a cute and fragile housewife whose useless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to get away because he needs money to pay a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many soft-core films of the 90s, actually gives the best interpretation of the film as a slutty lover. You'll also like the small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a beautiful cameo in one of the best scenes. The ending didn't make much sense!
