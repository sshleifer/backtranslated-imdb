MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> Well, I sat late and watched this movie, mainly because I enjoyed and evaluated some of Singleton's previous works like "Boyz n the hood". However, I have to say that this was a great disappointment and that is all I hate about invented "message" films, clich√©s and so-called. <br /> <br /> Acting is mainly poor, (pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors ... take note), situations that are difficult to digest, (does the rape victim become lesbian during the night? ... please!), but the worst of all reinforces every messy stereotype you can think of. From the second part of the film it became a cartoon like in its characterization, making you lose every bit of empathy you might have had for its one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once has any valid point been made about the intrinsic causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it simply ends up sensationalizing the results of these problems. His message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of cohesion of the plot. As for the conclusion of the films, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and slightly offensive. For a film called "Higher Learning" I have to say that all I learned is to never see it again. <br /> <br /> If you want a real comment on some of the themes that this movie can't fully process then go to rent "American History X" .... unless you were just looking at it for Tyra Banks, then go to take on a life.
