I gave this film a single star just because it was impossible to give it less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have developed a formula to replicate any organism. In their laboratory (a ruined warehouse in L.A.), they create a T-Rex. A group of industrial spies breaks in to steal the formula and the rest of the film is an endless pursuit. <br /> <br /> Of course the T-Rex (a rubber puppet) loosens and starts sweeping away the cast. He has the extraordinary ability to sneak up to 2 or 3 feet from someone without him noticing and then bites quickly. <br /> <br /> A cast member escapes in a police car and spends the rest of the film driving aimlessly through the city. He has such superior mental capacity that he can't even make the radio work. He never makes any attempt to go to a substation or a donut shop and seems hopelessly lost. <br /> <br /> The T-Rex creates havoc throughout the city, there are cannon battles and buildings (cardboard models) explode, but only one police car, or army, nor anyone else shows up . This activity must be common in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can only hope that a sequel is not planned.
