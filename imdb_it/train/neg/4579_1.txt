"What do Bleep know ?!" It was one of the worst times I ever went to the movies. It was less than a movie and more than a special after-school, but at the same time nothing special. The attempt at a narrative in which they founded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost no one will tell you. Marlee Matlin in underwear shouldn't happen. I will not dwell on this. What I will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. This film, although boring, has also suffered from a tremendous flaw in reasoning. It was horribly contradictory because it required such a manipulator, to become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, unscrupulous piece of propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a great feast of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our surroundings with our minds. He completely neglects that there are other people with the mind that could control us, which seems to be more true. Or at least the structures in which we exist limit us a lot. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnection do not mix if you are not almighty God. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) By all the beautiful things that this film will reveal that you can do. Otherwise, you'll be very disappointed, a moron, or maybe both. Also, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble telling people not to see the movie because I think it is too late to mention it by name. Shame on everyone involved
