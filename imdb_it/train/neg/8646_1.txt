This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was about to get up and leave for Tape 4, but I blocked it. Now I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on guys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide the Sanskrit posters? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was particularly inept. Regardless of the bad acting and the most zealous movement of the camera, I thought of using the events of September 11th as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, on a screen near you" shameful and irreverent to the victims of September 11th . Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, presumably from one of the terrorist planes held that day, was terrifying. The movement of the camera didn't make me sick, that cold-hearted acrobatics.
