I honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now. Death (and making fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adults threatening children, cruelty, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, baby sitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, policemen fat people and children who sneak off of the house in the middle of the night - yes, it certainly sounds like a children's movie - NOT !!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman who owns and transforms into a home and keeps her loving husband prisoner inside for over 20 years, and even terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet it is for children. PARENTS - this is exactly what you want your children to look at - is this what you want to teach them about life ?! <br /> <br /> This movie is too scary for kids, and I'm afraid kids could live a bit of this movie scene today - so why rub it in the face? As for an adult audience - you won't find it scary or funny - just boring, inventive and predictable. And the characters are simply wrong - incompetent parents, ignorant cops, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and boyfriends who drink beer and women. What great material for children: does this really sound like a children's movie? Even computer animation and good vocal work are not enough to redeem this terrible film. Save your money, save your time and save the minds of your children - go rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - ANY of them is much better than this horrible movie. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame about both for making such a disaster and then having branded it as a movie for children / family !!
