My nose is slightly out of shape as I write this. I sent a previous comment about this film a few weeks ago that hasn't appeared yet, so I assume it was rejected, even though it met all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes, in particular the performance by Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who appeared in important productions such as "Blow" and "The Alamo". Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything ends up with the weight of a really terrible and melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of free nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or even lends an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a wonderfully filmed work of art. <br /> <br /> A real day trip to the beach of Valencia would be much less difficult than having to meet these fictional characters again anywhere, anytime.
