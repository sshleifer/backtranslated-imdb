The show echoed the "bubbling" sound effect used to put me to sleep. A very relaxing show I think I could have slept through the parts where there was danger or danger. I also heard that some shots for a sponge divers show were shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume that Lloyd Bridges never dived there. I only remember the show in the replicas and, although it was never exciting, we would have invented our underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... imagining the boiling sounds that echoed and told our adventures in our heads. I thought "Flipper" had a better underwater action. Of course, he had the advantage of being in his natural environment.
