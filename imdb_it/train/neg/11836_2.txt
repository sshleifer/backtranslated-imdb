After all, too silly and useless. Yes, there is the metaphor of the golden cage, but probably most of the boys will not notice that. Forgettable. Immediately. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as expected, super-real. The plot could be described as subtle but tenacious. Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me. <br /> <br /> The underworld of the sewers is a pretty disgusting reflection of the world above and, somehow, wealth and money seem to count a lot too. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest with the female who is the most intelligent, most experienced and lover of the couple - this in itself is quickly becoming a boring (anti) stereotype. Your kids will probably love it anyway.
