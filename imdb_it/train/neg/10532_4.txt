Madison is not bad - if you like the simplistic, non-offensive, "family" fare and, more importantly, if you know absolutely nothing about unlimited hydroplanes. If, like me, you grew up with sport and your heroes have names like Musson, Muncey, Cantrell, Slovak, etc., get ready to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Professional film critics have long commented on the formidable nature of the film and its inclination to use every clich√© in sports in the book. I don't need to repeat what they said. What I sadly missed was the sense of the true excitement of an unlimited hydroelectric race in the "glory years" (which many would have claimed had already passed in 1971). <br /> <br /> Yes, it was wonderful to see the old classic boats roaring along the way you are at the edge, although it was clear that the restored versions (off hats to volunteers at the Hydroplane and Race Boat Museum) were being nursed through scenes at reduced speed. But where was the sound? Much of the thrill of the old idros was the deafening roar of six Allison or Rolls-Merlin aircraft engines, wrapped in RPMs never imagined by their designers, hitting the starting line right in front of you. You didn't hear it, you have FELT. The real hydroelectric know exactly what I'm talking about. There is none of this in Madison. Instead, each race scene is buried under what should be a "heroic" musical score. <br /> <br /> And then there are the close-ups of the pilots, who drive easily and comfortably in the cockpits as if they were relaxing in the latest luxury limousines, in some cases taking the time to smile maliciously while meditating on the best way to foil the poor hero of the hometown. Or, in a particularly ridiculous shot, take the time to identify Jake Lloyd who makes a "rocky" salute from a pier of a bridge. In fact, some unlimited pilots wore bullet-proof vests to minimize the beating they took when boats crashed into rock-hard water at speeds in excess of 150 miles per hour. <br /> <br /> As a review says so appropriately, "Sport deserves better." <br /> <br /> Finally, as another user has resorted to anachronisms, I will add one: l image of Seattle shows the Kingdome and the Safeco Field. Neither of them existed in 1971
