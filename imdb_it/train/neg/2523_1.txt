R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the master. <br /> <br /> Grotesquely horrible. <br /> <br /> Endless; no closure. <br /> <br /> Completely and absolutely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" as the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely unexpected disorder, unmodified, unwritten, not directed, not produced by a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just discovered - MADE A SECOND ONE! I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating their films. This mess of one thing makes those movies just bad - not terrible horrible and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie for which I ever said this: REMOVE FROM NETFLIX - NOW !!! 10,000 people out of 10 found this comment helpful.
