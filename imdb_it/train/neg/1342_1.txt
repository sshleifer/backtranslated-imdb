This film is the freshman effort of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While suffering from some problems, like any low-budget production, it is a good start for Mrs Beaton and her company. <br /> <br /> The story was not terribly new in films like The Burning and every Friday 13 from the second part. But the performances are heard. So many big-budget films have only the actors who face the scenes, it's always nice to see the actors really trying to hone their art. <br /> <br /> The story is about the murder (and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others have sworn to keep the secret, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in life. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome gruesome known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You have to look. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't worry. But if your taste gets closer to Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then take a look at "The Bagman".
