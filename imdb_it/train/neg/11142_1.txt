This is absolutely the worst piece of shit I've ever had to look at - actually it was so bad that I just had to watch it :-) <br /> <br /> The CGI is so bad that it's fun! It's not even close to Spawn's crappy CGI animations, it's so bad it is, very difficult ... <br /> <br /> I'm amazed that some distribution companies have actually put the money down to release this on DVD , but I guess they'll get more out of it this way, 'because the cost of making it can't be more than a few hundred dollars. <br /> <br /> It's so terrible that a kindergarten could have made it. <br /> <br /> Watch it and laugh!
