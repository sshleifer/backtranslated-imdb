I have rarely seen a waste of free talent. There is almost nothing constructive to say about this impalpable swamp of a film. What few interesting trends that the film seems to promise initially prove to be little more than simple fakes. High-caliber actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are lined up in roles that go nowhere; an occasional genius director produces a film that seems filmed through a coffee-stained photographic lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit discovers new depths of inactivated inconsistency. The film has an economic feeling, lascivious - but barely at the level of comments - it really is part of aesthetics. Normally, I come to IMDb to write balanced, generally grateful comments. This striking disaster of a film makes me want to produce an infinite and bilious outburst. I will not, but only because I no longer want to occupy my "mind" with this garbage.
