I was very disappointed with this movie. Basically she was weak to the limit of the fool: souls that can influence reality the way they do it? An apparently critical mission for the Soul Hunters entrusted to one of their younger members? And the whole story of B with "holobrothel" and the lawsuit against the station was so terrible that at one point I blurted out on television, "Why are you wasting my time with this?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "River of Souls" did not delve into the soul issue in more depth than the original "Soul Hunter" episode. We see that the Soul Hunters can make mistakes, but we still have no feeling for their culture. (Are there any female Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> The acting was ok, given the material they had to work with, and the special effects - especially the planets in the first act - were really impressive. But overall, I'd say give this a miss.
