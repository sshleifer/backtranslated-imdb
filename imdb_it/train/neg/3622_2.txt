I took it a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show of my youth, I decided to watch it with my 4 year old daughter. I should have taken some psychedelic mushrooms to do it, because it's just weird! Not only is it a musical with annoyingly forgettable melodies, the necessary effects of cheese and cameos of stars that exceed their collective prime numbers, it seems to have been produced as someone's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children all too old for this kind of crap ... in the words of Krusty the Klown "uuuuuugggghghhhhh! What was I?" If you are a big fan of all of Sid and Marty Krofft's work, try doing it; otherwise, unless you are willing to go around before looking, stay away, far away, far away.
