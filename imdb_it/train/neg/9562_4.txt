I think this may have been a decent movie, and some of its parts are OK ... but overall it's a B movie. The same goes for the plot, the parts are OK but it has several holes and oddities that don't add up. Acting is mostly OK, I've seen even worse than this. :) <br /> <br /> The beginning defines the level, with the cars driving in the desert, making "fresh" but totally useless jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! Cool!), as if the drivers do not had never seen sand before ... It gets slightly better from there, but not much. <br /> <br /> If you want to rent this, take another one and use it as a heater. Keep expectations low and it might work for you.
