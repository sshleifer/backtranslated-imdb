This is even worse than the original game of death. A confusing and inconsistent plot leads to "Billy Lo" falling from a helicopter on the ground below, killing him, while we are left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only are we starting to follow a Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that and makes us follow another thirty minutes into the story. The main reason for seeing this is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is obviously a boy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, which is usually really cool, but his screen time is very small. Mostly seen this and the original game of death because they are part of the Bruce Lee set. No wonder they are included in Lee's works. No one would buy them otherwise.
