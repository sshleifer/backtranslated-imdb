I mistakenly kept watching last night last night. The only thing I could say well about this horrible film is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. The set-ups were useless and deceptive, and the excessive use of split screens was wasted because sometimes they couldn't even synchronize with alternative shots. If I could give this a zero or less rating I would do it. Unfortunately, it's not even worth the time for some laughter. <br /> <br /> It's just a sad example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I waste my time even thinking about it.
