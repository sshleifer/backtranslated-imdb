I was expecting a lot from this movie. A bit like Lee as a Naustradamous character, but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. He had wooden acting, a terrible script based on passages from the Bible such as hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. But that was the end! For the rest I had to wait and hope that something significant would happen but it is not. This film is about a couple trying to discover the changes going on in the world as places in China where there was an earthquake and end up in a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent ends up being the key to the misshappenings. The whole film is misleading and boring. One of the worst in Lees.
