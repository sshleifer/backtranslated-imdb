Not that "a film by Ulli Lommel" filled me with hope, but I must confess that ZODIAC KILLER managed to sink under my lowest expectations. There is a recent trend among young filmmakers to use digital videos for their first projects, which is good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive movie stocks. But many of these young filmmakers have also decided to filter the finished film so that it looks qualitatively more similar to celluloid. The effect is never perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really only works for the "mockumentary" style, because it doesn't look like anything other than video. Here lies the main problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera on a murderer. It does not seem to watch a movie. And what is even more unforgivable is that Lommel is NOT a young director. He should know better. He should know that it is practically impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) On video. For the love of God, this boy has been directing since the 60s! He could be the only director who failed to improve over forty years in the industry. And luckily we also wrote the script! So you can expect complicated actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior and at least a really pretentious plot element that will leave you completely unsatisfied. Please, please, lose this movie. You can thank me later.
