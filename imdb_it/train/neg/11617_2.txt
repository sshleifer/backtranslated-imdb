This "Joshua" movie is extremely disturbing and utterly useless. It actually makes me shudder to think that there are people who would like to watch it. Without revealing the story it is a young man's reaction to his newborn sister, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this film, the viewer is subject to some of the most disturbing childish behaviors imaginable. Adding insult to injury, at the end of this film there is absolutely no real result except the enjoyment of pure evil at the hands of a child no less, who has outsmarted a whole group of stupid adults. There is no redemption, no justice is served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is happening around them. Frankly, I didn't like watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who might like horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well played, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to 90 minutes waiting in the waiting room of a dentist waiting for some painful dental procedure.
