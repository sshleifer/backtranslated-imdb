The night of the dance: the most important night for any superficial girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when a tiny event occurred in their tiny lives. <br /> <br /> There is really no excuse for the dance night. There is nothing original about it and I would really have given zero or fewer stars if it were possible on IMDb. The only part of my vision that I appreciated was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play "ghosts". It was much more exciting than what was happening on the screen in front of them. <br /> <br /> The plot was basically a boy who was furious. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting fury. Perhaps if the boy had been frighteningly remote, rather than a tame Robbie Williams with a baseball cap, I could have sat there slightly anxious. The fact that I was less interested in the characters than it was in the color of the cinema carpet certainly did not contribute to the effect. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and unaware. The hotel staff did not seem to notice or worry that one of their waitresses had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognizable after shaving. I was incredibly surprised that the bitch and stereotypical girl in blue dress was the only person to notice who she was. He understands it and then falls down the stairs, gets caught in a plastic sheet and then spills a pile of paint buckets. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> The worst thing was, I think the director is trying his hardest absolute. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any real murder happening. Shocking! And the music doesn't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as undressing at a funeral. <br /> <br /> I would really like that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, safe and sound, has any reason to see this movie. The mainstream cinema seems to go downhill and films like this make the situation worse. If you want to see this absolutely horrible movie, listen to my plea. Don't do it There are better things to spend six pounds on. Like a sheet with which to play ghosts.
