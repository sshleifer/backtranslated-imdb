Roy Rogers and the company try to bring "Sintown" back to life: it is a ghost town that could explode if silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (as "Cookie") around. Jane Frazee (in the role of Carol) loses a piece of her whores with Mr. Rogers' sharp-eyed leer. Foy Willing and the knights of the Sage Viola argue (or is that singing?) For the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the children of the pioneers. James Finlayson (from the films of Laurel and Hardy) adds to the "slapstick" look of "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floorboard offers the winning comic performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks his heels. There are also human energy performances - but the material is not Grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine
