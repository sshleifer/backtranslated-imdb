Wanda Nevada is an adolescent fantasy film that uses ideas from 1979 about what constitutes an illicit novel for 13-year-old girls. Script, rhythm and direction are uniformly terrible. Action sequences challenge beliefs. The characters speak with the simplified diction that is usually found in films aimed at the set of sub 10, but also includes multiple sexual references involving the character of Shields and even graphic death. <br /> <br /> The film wants to be a comedy of some level but it is never fun, an image of adventure but plot and action are insipid and a film for children, but it introduces pedophilia and rape of children as real possibilities. He also wants to be a friend, an animated film, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual film, a travel journal and a western. The general affection is of enormous stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see many beautiful Grand Canyon shots. Which manages to do well.
