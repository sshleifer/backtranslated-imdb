It is rare that you come across a film so horrible, annoying and irritating. It is without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot, when it's not a blur of confusion and unnecessary flashy changes, is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a tough bitch? Because her gold fish died when she was a child and this "traumatic" event leaves her emotionally stunted and hates everyone. When the dialogue is not trivial or trivial, it is littered with ridiculous lines such as: "There are three types of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and all the others". At some point the bounty hunters have a guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. Because of a confused phone call, instead of rolling up their sleeves and reading the number, they blow his arm with a rifle. At another point, bounty hunters take a bomb for a meeting organized with the mafia and threaten to detonate the bomb unless the mafia lets them go ?! Clearly not going to the meeting would have been too easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is not convincing and terribly annoyed. Mickey Rourke manages to regain some credibility from this mess. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Tony Scott's previous films, True Romance is one, but all I could think of while suffering from this drivel was that it must have been done by a complete idiot.
