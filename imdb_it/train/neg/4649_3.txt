A 1957 (yes, it's the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; must be a successful comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a gag movie: watching people be shocked at the sight of a small alligator. The music is launched, most inappropriately and hopelessly. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what was he doing in this movie? Diana Dors is here too, providing really bold shots to use in the previews. His acting level is not bad, but it is in the film to offer someone to watch it. Well, one has to do something to complain about during this movie. The film is sold on VHS now by people on e-Bay. Save money and waste time. A comedy without a laugh. A musical without a memorable song or dance.
