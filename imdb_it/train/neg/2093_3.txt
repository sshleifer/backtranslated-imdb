If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you, as far as I'm concerned, it doesn't work for me and after seeing 3 episodes I can't see it anymore. It's boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100,000+ years ago if the basics of the battlestar galactica chronology of getting to earth seem to have all the same things around like the 100,000-year-old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the famous brand LCD TVs for 100,000 years. The same goes for the rest of the sets and the show, there are only a lot of things involved today to not neglect, I think they could have done a lot better than a job to get around these problems and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same problems but not so bad. As for the rest of the show, it's not nearly as good as BSG was and is it a poor pre-sequel ??
