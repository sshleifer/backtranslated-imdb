This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not at all funny, and even boring. <br /> <br /> I can only take all of these 10 out of 10 favorites. the film's all-time comments are actually the actors themselves incognito. <br /> <br /> Idk what is the runtime on this film I'm sure is listed on this page. Surely it seemed like an eternity <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a difficult challenge, try sitting in this horrible movie. <br /> <br /> otherwise <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time like I did on this
