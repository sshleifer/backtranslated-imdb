I understand the jokes well enough, they are simply not good. The show is horrible. I understand that, and that's another horrible thing about it. The only interesting character that EVER was on the show was that hobo in that episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is horrible. It's not fun, NOT fun! I don't want people to say "Only smart people understand it" because if they are so smart, why do they judge people they don't even know and say they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "The sky is red" but never look outside. But in any case, this is absolutely the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they are simply horrible, his controversy is very disgusting, his jokes and other jokes on the body i liquids are really stupid and usually consist of really bad acting. I'm not sure what these "smart" people see in this show, but judging others when they know nothing about any of us isn't exactly a clever comment.
