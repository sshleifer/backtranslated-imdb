Wow. What a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel. Here are just a few complaints. - The writer eliminated two main characters from the book. - The plot has been grotesquely altered. - Voiceover sounds like they are directly raised by written passages (which can read well but are not the same when they are spoken, especially with Chabon's writing style). - The acting is more wooden than a log cabin. (Exp. Bechstein) - Should it be set in 1983 ??? It looks more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> To be honest I couldn't finish watching this movie, so it's possible that he redeemed himself ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one paid to see this, or at least no one who read the book hoping for something decent (a la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but he should be ASHAMED of this adaptation. <br /> <br /> No stars.
