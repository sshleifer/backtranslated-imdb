The story at the beginning is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem is that he intentionally punishes two of the enemies favored by director Richard Fleisher: Arabs and Germans. To make us believe that very Arab-looking men would be free to wander around and easily capture blacks in West Africa, it is as credible as the whites who hunt slaves in the "roots". Obviously both businesses are / were managed by locals and involve (d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicit in today's child sex slave trade, Israel is one of the worst violators according to Amnesty International. So why only indicate the Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious prejudice and hatred for those people by a Jewish director. <br /> <br /> The acting is above average, especially of Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is as good as ever.
