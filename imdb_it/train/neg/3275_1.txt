DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM IF YOU LOVED CLASSICS LIKE TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, BEN BEN JONES! THIS FILM WILL BE DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY! First of all, this film begins with Bo and Luke performing moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would never do it in the real series! This film portrays unimaginable characters who do things that would never have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest and law-abiding. In this film, he is a criminal who is making moonlight and smoking grass with the governor of Georgia. Also, if it's an extension that joins the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have a question: HOW WOULD YOU PUT JESSE TO DO MOONSHINE WHEN Did he die before the dukes of Hazzard in the Hollywood movie? AND HOW THE BOSS HOGG WORKS WHEN He died before the 1997 meeting movie! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE RETURNED TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DIED FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, it should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000 and create a family film with the original characters that made it the show of what it was and still is compared to this disgusting and dishonored movie! If you want to watch Good Dukes movies, buy the original series, or go to walmart.com and buy the 2 DVD set that includes Reunion and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies! Both are protagonists of the original cast and are suitable for families! Don't waste your time with a movie that is not worth the CD on which it is written!
