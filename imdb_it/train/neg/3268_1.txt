It is a real challenge to make a film about a child who is eaten by wild dogs and the mother is wrongly accused of a funny murder, but against all odds this happens. Meryl Streep gives the performance of her life, melodramatic, exasperated but with that comic genius that makes you laugh even when a mother fights with the utmost horror. <br /> <br /> If the children's comedies that are eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you may be uncomfortable watching it and, yes, it is a strange choice of topic for a farce but actually very little film has something to do with one in which it focuses on giving Streep a showcase for its Australian accent and facial contortions. <br /> <br /> Launching a momentum against media prejudice and sensationalism and contempt for truth or ethics gives the film the chance to make the bold point that those things are bad.
