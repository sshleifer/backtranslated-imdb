I'm still shivering at the thought of never seeing this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies, I also liked a lot of them, but that's too much. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have the worst actor ever (Sly Stallone) who plays the lead role, but the film's plot is so stupid from the start (why not steal the money while the plane is at earth, it would be much simpler) that requires a person with IQ lower than his or her class to believe in it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the plot has no real turning point, a three-year-old could guess what will come next. It's a set of clich√©s (of action genre), with Sly playing even worse than his other films (it was even better in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than an action film). Now there's an actor who can't play A) surprised B) sad C) nothing but his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would still like to point out that this film has two factors that could make some people pleasant. EXPLOSIONS are exceptional, but then ... you can see better on July 4th. THE LANDSCAPES are magnificent, but then ... there are documentaries on the Alps and the Himalayas, so you can see the best views in this way, rather than waste time in this film. <br /> <br /> Look at some other films instead, there are hundreds, even thousands of best action movies.
