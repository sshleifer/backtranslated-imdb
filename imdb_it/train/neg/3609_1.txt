This must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it first came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I went out to buy the DVD once it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother going into the plot because it's so transparent that you can still see it through. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to gum effects and bad acting, but these people take him to a completely different level. It's almost as if they were intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if that was their goal, they passed. If they intended to make a film that should have frightened you or made you believe in any way, form or form that was real, then they failed ... MISERABLE! Avoid this movie ... read the synopsis plot and see it!
