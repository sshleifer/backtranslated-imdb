Seriously, why do American and French actors who pretend to be Czechs have to speak perfect English with a fake Russian accent? I'm a man, so I liked free nudity - but a soft porn movie would have had more, and at least it wouldn't have pretended it was artistic. <br /> <br /> All the political statements in which they are painfully didactic - has the director heard of subtlety? The acting was also woody and melodramatic, and the comic relief was never fun. The characters were very superficial and I could not identify them at all. <br /> <br /> The point where I laughed was when they cut the actors in archive footage of the demonstrations in Prague - and they were in black and white and then in sepia to match the footage - simply ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I read many of Kundera's stories (not The unbearable lightness of being), and there are good things about his writing style (although his themes are a great male fantasy) and, I have to say, the film has NOT transmitted anything of the goodness of Kunderas' style.
