For me, every work of art must be judged on the basis of these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey seems dedicated to shapes: beautiful shots and sometimes interesting acting. The long close ups suggest a function that the viewer can fill out on his own. Due to the lack of texts, the story becomes a quiz. An introverted person suggests having depth, but sometimes it appears that he has nothing to say. This film behaves like an introverted person. If you haven't read the synopsis you can't see that it was suicide (and the unanswered question Why?) That changes Anna's opinion on life and makes her suspicious. "Why do not you talk to me?" asks Sebastiaan. Anna doesn't answer, she just starts looking at him for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that shot? What does it mean? My question is how Sebastiano: what does this film have to say? What is meant by this film? The answer for me: it shows us a handful of people with the passion of a glass of water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. The reasons behind their actions are not shown. The rest is: skins, dwellings, landscapes. Beautiful and artistic, but meaningless without having "instructions for use". In my opinion this film is made for other artists, not for the common spectator.
