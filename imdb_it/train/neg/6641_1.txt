I've seen this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantastic fantasy film. I'm also a film / theater director and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see that the events are happening at the same time with the 9/11 incident. No history, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Only empty images. <br /> <br /> What most Romanians don't know, this film is for French viewers, not for us. They really believe that it is reality in Romania. Even for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making films. I really don't know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such an image in Europe. This was a reality, but it is no longer. A good friend of mine from the Brithish Embassy said: "You have no idea what a long way the Romanian people walked by Ceausescu".
