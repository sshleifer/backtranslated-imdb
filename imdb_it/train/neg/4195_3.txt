Given the people involved, it's hard to see why this movie should be so messy and boring. The writer, David Ward, wrote the incredible caper movie "The Sting" two years later, Jane Fonda has just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland has just done an excellent job in films like "Klute", " Start the Revolution Without Io "and" Kelly's Heroes ". After all, the film is a tale of capers, with a small band of miserable misfits planning a great blow. At the same time, the film wants to be fashionable satire, a series of comic sketches of the kind that the NBC TV show "Saturday Night" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits apparently clumsy and forced and the disconnected comic fragments destroy any kind of suspense that could have hit. It is literally a film that continues to shatter itself, just as cars in cars in demolition scenes are intertwined with one another. <br /> <br /> The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. His "Iris Caine" should be a carefree version of his dramatic character from Bree Daniels' prostitute in "Klute". However, it is not believed for a moment. It is always Jane Fonda who pretends to be a prostitute we are watching. It's a terrible performance as his performance in "Klute" was fantastic. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to direct the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be big or pathetic. It suggests that the actors are as good as their writers and directors.
