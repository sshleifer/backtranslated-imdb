I watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it is. Someone was murdered or maybe not and maybe someone did or maybe not. That brought back the good old days (bad old times?) When all the Canadian CBC films were smelly. Lately the stinkers have been the exception, but this confusing mixture of fashionable feminism, flashbacks of the mind and mumbled dialogues makes up for lost time. I never found Margaret Atwood books that were easy to read. This film continues that beautiful Canadian tradition. It is not easy to look at. Maybe the trendy people at the chi-Toronto cocktail party will pretend to like it. We people in the boonies are a little less pretentious.
