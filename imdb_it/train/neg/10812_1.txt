What a pathetic movie. <br /> <br /> I won't waste much time commenting on it. I'm still trying to make up for the couple of hours I've wasted. <br /> <br /> Let me just leave it with - Shaq HAS NO COMPANY being an actor or singer. He is completely lacking in talent in both clubs. It's a shame that many talented people waste in community theaters and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to get cast in movies and cut CDs immediately. <br /> <br /> Much of the failure of this film was the pathetic non-talent that is Shaq.
