This was a better than average film, I thought, because it was on cable. I had expected something along the lines of mischievous melodrama and bad special effects seen in classics like Christmas Rush or First Daughter / Target / Shot, etc. <br /> <br /> The cast was well chosen ... I particularly liked Ron Livingston as the SWAT pressure commander. It's nice to see him revisiting the same material with which he was so lucky in Band of Brothers. Producers and designers did their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they were made that day in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you have the chance to watch this movie, I'm sure that since FX repeats all 50 times ... take 2 hours and have fun.
