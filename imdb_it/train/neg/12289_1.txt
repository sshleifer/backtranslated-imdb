I'm getting sick of movies that look funny in a single line synopsis and end up being up to what is at the bottom of a compost heap. <br /> <br /> Who knows: "Witchery" It may have seemed interesting in a field of studies, even with a cast of big names (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent of Hildegard Knef (I don't know, some women ...). <br /> <br /> But on the film, it shatters faster than a papier-mâché sculpture in a storm. It seems that these unfortunate people are trapped in an island villa off the east coast, and one of them (a woman, I imagine) has been targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offended in grotesque, tortuous ways. <br /> <br /> Ok, here is a cross section of plots from "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "Ten Little Indians" and a few other minor films in satanic worshipers line friend. None of this is very funny and, for the most part, you will restrict yourself from one scene to another until it is over. <br /> <br /> No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help much. There are only to collect a salary and do not seem very willing to give them their "everything". <br /> <br /> From his appearance, Hasselhoff probably would like to be back on the sidelines with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda ... well, who knows; a PETA award for celebrities or a pro-am golf tour or whatever it is nowadays. <br /> <br /> And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You will see people shut their mouths shut, dangling inside roaring fireplaces, perching in trees during a violent storm, ships bursting from their necks, etc. Etc. Sheesh, and I thought "Mark of the Devil" was the most sadistic film I had seen .... <br /> <br /> Don't bother. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you how much I did. If you look at it, see if you can count the clichés. And yes, Blair is possessed, as if I hadn't seen THAT coming down Main Street followed by a band. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchery" - these witches will itch you.
