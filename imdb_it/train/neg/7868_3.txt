I have seen many of Guy Maddin's films and I liked most of them, but this literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is too hectic and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence that shows a line of heads that breaks to look at an object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the public. <br /> Another thing I didn't like about this film is that it looked more brutal than Maddin's previous works - even though his films have always had obscure elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the film a feeling dominant of humanity. This seemed harsher to me than hardness. <br /> <br /> Since I was asked to add more lines of text before IMDb accepts my review, I will mention that the actor who plays "Guy Maddin" handles his facial expressions quite well.
