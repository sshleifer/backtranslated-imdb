Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two fundamental things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE sees Gene Hackman as a prisoner unleashed from prison to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his agents --- presumably working for the government, but this, like much of the film's plot, is never made clear. Hackman asks many questions to which he has NEVER responded, so the film is absolutely not going anywhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well photographed, but even that works against it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any style. It's a very sunny movie! <br /> <br /> Acting goes well with Hackman who proves to be practically incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are appropriately evil and Albert is well represented as Widmark's cruel servant. Even the usual heinous Mickey Rooney is as good as Hackman's partner. An oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We have been told that he has run out of time in prison and he seems to be trying to set up some sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of ​​making her look like junk trailer is to have her wear an ugly brown wig. It is a role that is best suited to characters like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
