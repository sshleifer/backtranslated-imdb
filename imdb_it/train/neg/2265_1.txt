I love watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this excuse for a soft-core porn movie is unnecessarily offensive, lacks anything that looks like wit, and simply serves as a self-promotion vehicle for Springer. Even if it runs for 90 minutes, the movie drags on horribly, and I should have had the good sense to go out. Simply atrocious.
