I didn't watch the whole movie. I couldn't see the whole movie. I stopped the DVD after watching it for half an hour and suggested to anyone thinking of looking at themselves before removing the disc from the case. <br /> <br /> I like both tragic and comic mafia films, but Corky Romano can only be described as a tragic attempt at a mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Corky Romano simply tries too much to make the audience laugh, the plot seems to be an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) from one scene to another. Corky himself is completely exaggerated and lacking in subtlety or credulity - all his strange mannerisms seem invented - Chris Kattan is clearly "acting" rather than taking on a role - bouncing out of history. Each scene is completely predictable, the comic event that will occur on the set is evident as each scene is presented. In comedies like Mr. Bean the disasters caused by the title character are fun because you can empathize with the motivations of the characters and the initial event and the situation in which the character ends is not wired. However, Corky gives the impression that he is deliberately ruining himself in a desperate attempt to provoke laughter from the public. <br /> <br /> If Chris hadn't played such an alien character (who never really connects with the other characters in the film) and whose behavior is completely inexplicable (except for trying to get laughter) and the comic scenes weren't so predictable and stereotyped - all the jokes seemed too familiar - this movie could have been watchable. But it is not. Don't watch it
