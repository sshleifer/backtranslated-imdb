This film is a collection of incomprehensible analogies and ill-conceived plot devices. <br /> <br /> Story of the film: The director of this film was a pervert who traveled around the city to shoot random women. When his wife discovered the film's reels, he was forced to quickly invent a story. He claimed he was making a film called "The Brain That He Would Not Die." In the end, his wife asked to show her his "so-called movie". That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "The Brain that would not Die" was born. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Synopsis Synopsis: The main character's boyfriend is killed in a horrible car accident (which he caused by ignoring clearly marked road signs). Grab the head from the wreck and revive it. After reviving his head, he goes to get a group of prostitutes. This is pretty much what happens to the rest of the film. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a prostitute and I assume they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Side notes: the final credit screen states that the film is called "The Head that would not Die". <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
