This film was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called that?) I was expecting something artistic and thoughtful with beautiful images. He had some interesting images, but these often seemed random and made no sense. In fact they seemed to have been inserted to fill the time. Eventually the effect was listless. I think the film should have been atmospheric, but it wasn't. The lack of a coherent plot didn't help things. You could say it was mysterious, but I think it was simply inconsistent without atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The main character seemed to be disturbed, but the plot didn't appeal to me enough to worry about his situation. Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not an idiot but the sex scenes (there were different ones) seemed useless and confused me further, I recognized Lulu but I wasn't sure it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or she a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered that the hairy back was destined to belong to his lover. This film managed to make what should have been shocking (the dream sequences involving Lulu's mother) seems a bit boring. <br /> <br /> Nail filing actually made more sense, as it indicated Lulu's emotional state. I don't want to criticize the actors because they don't have much to work with. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the lack of context or flow in the film was due to ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can't be bothered to talk about it anymore.
