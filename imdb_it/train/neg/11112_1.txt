Wow, how bad can it be. This was badly bad. Not in terms of gore - which was mainly resable in CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible: the main character's arc was a complete joke. Within a few nights of Vinnie Jones' stalking, he starts to become "tormented" to the point of crying while photographing his girlfriend. Um ... are all New York photographers so childish, suggestible and weak? His character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and in the end you laugh out loud for the absolutely predictable and totally absurd turnaround your character takes. <br /> <br /> The bloody moments were clearly only a weak effort, little respected by themselves to jump on the modern MTV style wagon - all cgi, blood but no real emotion. These parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting to their self-awareness - disturbing camera angles, etc. <br /> <br /> Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters in the end) is ruined in favor of the self-criticism of "look at me". This film was not made and the public - it was created for a CV - a deeply selfish motive.
