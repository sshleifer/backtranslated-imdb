What can I say about Seven Pounds ... well, I saw a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and since the flight was long and boring, the film didn't help me. The character of Will Smith, Ben Thomas, is almost completely unlikely even with his redemption at the end. The two hours plus the running time of the movie waste most of the time on the screen with random junk that just slows the plot as much as possible. In the film, the character of Rosario Dawson adds a bit of life to the film, though not much. I don't understand how anyone can really cry during this movie when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Even Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the end proving that killing himself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.
