I saw this movie as a girl (I'm 27) and it scared me for years without doing anything. I had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to music for (obviously) violence. My parents continue to argue about who allowed me to watch it and they both say they would never let me see a movie like that. I think they just say that I know I have such strong feelings about it, 0) I'm currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic) and it's really a great story. However, I don't think it should have been turned into a cartoon. Never. Well, maybe kids today would find it characteristic but they gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and I still have trouble seeing similarly designed rabbits. Each time it gives me a little heartbeat. I am a wuss but I strongly suggest that any parent who wants to show this film to their children, read the book or look at it first to make sure it approves the content. Not everyone finds it as disturbing as me, but we are out there; 0)
