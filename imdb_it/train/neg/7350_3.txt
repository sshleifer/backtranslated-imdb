Despite the rather negative reviews, did I have to start this movie ?? after all, he's the Hong Kong star, Shu Qi, and 6 other beautiful fans of the oriental movement like a team of all-action cat thieves. Surely worth a try? Well, when children's games go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is of high quality. Shu Qi looks fantastic as always, and the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang have caught my wandering eye in particular. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if you have to judge this film with any other merits, it's an absolute stinker! The story is weak, the poor action and the pathetic special effects. Director Clarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photogenic cast and little else. <br /> <br /> If Shu Qi is the only reason you're thinking of seeing it, you'd be better off watching Sex and Zen 2 again!
