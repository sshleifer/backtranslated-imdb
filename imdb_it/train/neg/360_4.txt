I read the book and loved it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the film I was very disappointed. First of all, don't disrespect Deborah Raffin but she was too mature to play a 24/25 woman. Even the late Christopher Reeve was a mixture, the same reason. Will, according to the book, was about 30. I would have liked to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's journey to see him as it was an important part of the character's storyline development. Miss Beasley was also upset because the book said she was a bigger lady. I know the film does not have the budget of the "Madison County Bridges", which I believe was published more or less at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me this was a poorly made, low budget, reckless film. As someone said, I would like Miss Spenser to come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they should be. He knows his characters better than anyone else, I hope you can also consider casting. The film disappointed me!
