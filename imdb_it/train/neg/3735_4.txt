The actress Patty Duke wrote a penetrating, amusing, crude book about her acting career, her crazy quilt, her manic-depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost turned her away for good. With this rich material from which to draw (and Patty who plays herself in the final act), one might think that a television director like Gilbert Cates could put it all together in a film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of the autobiography of Duke. For those who have not read the book, the outlined fiction (which jumps forward in time) is not absorbent, we are never allowed to come to terms with what is happening and the production seems to be stunted by a low budget. The actors are uncomfortable, and the value of finally having the same Duke does not seem to pay off - the fake reality of the film is so thick that Patty cannot bring stability to the scenario. It seems that the producers were sincere enough (and mindful) to direct the film towards Duke's final diagnosis and mental freedom, but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process.
