The potential cinematic extravagance, set during the 19th century, failed to produce. With famous actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the film to fail. However, the film lacked an ending, had an excuse sorry for a plot, and fell to pieces with its continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, gathered by love and destroyed by beauty (or lack of it) and disapproval, has a moving side to the premature death of a mother and an absent father. The father, played by Finney, is a disturbed man, who torments his daughter both in life and in death. He believes that his daughter's lack of good looks can ruin his fortune by marrying them under their social status. The actors tried in vain to save what remained of the plot. Washington Square is a black hole of ruin and destruction, wasting the precious time of those who look with sadness. I give this film a 1 instead of a 0, purely for the actors' attempts. Save yourself, stay away from Washington Square.
