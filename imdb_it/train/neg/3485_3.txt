This film was quite absurd. There were some fun parts. It goes straight into the basket of films in my memory where I think, "Hmm ... that film had some fun parts, but on the whole a fairly ridiculous plot (or lack of)." <br /> <br /> I thought it looked like Ben was trying a little too hard to be a fun and funny guy. And I didn't understand how he was a self-taught multimillionaire and still such an idiot. Anyway, I like Ben Affleck. It sucks, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked Jersey Girl, I didn't think Gigli was all his fault, I like him in general. I guess it's kind of like the kid you're sorry for the fact that he can't get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice is to avoid this movie. It didn't really develop into a viable plot and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. weren't used as they could have been. They deserved better. Overall, this movie is NOT home alone, NOT a Christmas story, NOT a Christmas holiday or one of the other classics. Forever forgettable.
