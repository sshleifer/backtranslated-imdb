I can only believe that Garson Kanin must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the funny "Born Yesterday" and co-wrote such excellent scripts as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and then the one who wrote and / or directed such a boring, sad drivel as "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and this. The cast tries, but the script is so tired and predictable that even the efforts of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro are defeated. The script comes down to his nadir in the really offensive sequence in which Janssen's character tests Drivas's character to make sure he's not gay. A bad sequence, but unfortunately one that could easily play in a movie today. The "ethnic" jokes are now totally verbose, but the "frocche" jokes are still "good, clean, fun for the family".
