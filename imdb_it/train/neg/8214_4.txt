This is not enough to delve into the depths of Creepshow 3, but it gets closer. He also uses the same technique to use some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is nothing short of simplistic. <br /> <br /> It is also rather irritating to tear off The Twilight Zone (with the bookshop comparable to Serling's later Night Gallery). Unfortunately, producers and writers have forgotten that Serling would have created sympathy for his characters before messing with them. None of the characters is particularly nice or interesting until the last segment. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West is ... well, himself. Does not go to the campy Bruce Wayne / Batman 60s, but rarely does it. It simply sounds the not-particularly-enigmatic "Jay" (there's a creepy ominous name to compare with the likes of Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper), and makes some slightly embarrassing / disturbing statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: "A Stop in Willoughby" by Seren Rod Serling? Then you saw this. The nutso's wife's red herring is introduced without purpose, but even the main character's friend identifies him as a weak one. As direct as can be expected, but fundamentally inconsistent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: recalls various stories of Serling's time travels, mixed with "A Meeting of Minds" by Steve Allen. Most of the actors are not bad (except Josh Astin as Cassius, who can walk, talk and even breathe awkwardly), and the idea is slightly interesting. But like Abernathy, it's not going anywhere. The main character raises some relatively reasonable questions, bugs out (a little who doesn't?), And for some reason ends up being exiled to a nuclear hog. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: not a bad piece and manages to prey on both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something that people are fascinated by the magic properties of remote controls. The main character is moderately sympathetic. Nothing substantially innovative here, but that's fine. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: see the shot that comes a mile away but, like the main character, has a little heart and is a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> <br /> Final: So ... why do people end up in cold storage in silver clothes? I don't know. It doesn't make sense. So ... all the protagonists entered the bookstore and were trapped? A little undermines the happy ending of the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the guy from the first segment is dead. So how was he trapped? He visited the bookstore before he died, was trapped and ... is he not dead? What? Eh? I suppose this doesn't make sense, because it's supernatural. But still ... <br /> <br /> In general: basically not unlike the two most recent Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second are probably worth it. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
