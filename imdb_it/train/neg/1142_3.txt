You were beaten and beaten in submission by my harsh statements about the "femme fatale" / "guns n 'gals" movies! Now comes another race in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movies! Many of these I've seen before, and let me tell you, I'm not all that broke to be! They usually don't stick to the point. This, among all the others, has no originality! What does a ninja have to do with the prevention of a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And shouldn't this also be a "martial arts" film? Does a lot of shots sound like an incredible action movie? Is blood the number one reason for loving him to death? Will you lose some of your hard-earned money with a lady singing in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions can be found in THE NINJA MISSION, which should be in the martial arts section of your video store. For even more fun ninja fun, try taking a look at those Godfrey Ho movies aired by Trans World. Get what you deserve and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
