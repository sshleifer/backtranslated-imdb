NOTICE SPOILER! ! ! I personally don't understand why Pete didn't help save Williams' life, I mean it would be nice to know why William was motivated, or forced. I think the members of the Secret Service are every day, and there is a rumor that the writer was a member of the Secret Service, now his motives are clear, well known. But as a rental this movie doesn't satisfy you, it causes the old, but also the turns, the average acting - these are just things in this movie, just to keep you. Wait for the end. this time, and I still wonder how the producers (for example Michael Douglas) left this movie at the cinema.
