I went to see this at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> As a movie it was painful, but seeing Bret Carr in person was seeing despair at its peak. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film was to see BC hit it in the face with what appeared to be a "C" battery. The jury is still out on this. He was from a dildo and was in slow-mo. Yes. <br /> <br /> "Just shoot the left side of the face ... people get famous asking for things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr wore a chicken suit for some reverse psychology, wandering the streets of Clifton hitting his movie. He should. This is right to hit the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul got irritated after this movie. <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be a cult leader, or smart enough for that matter. This is the feeling you get in the What the Bleepesque pile of brainwashed neo-yuppies that came to see this piece of work by Bret Carr. <br /> <br /> It is an emotionally draining experience thinking of writing about this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> - Anonymous
