When I go out to the video store to rent a movie, I usually trust IMDb's point of view on a movie and, up to this, I had never seen a movie with a rating of 7.0 or higher on the site I didn't like. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, is really cut down by doing one of the biggest mistakes a director can make: filling the cast of a film with absolutely unlikely characters without real qualities. <Br /> <br /> I like films with imperfect characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is, we all have a little light too, we are all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet has crossed this line by filling this film with totally unpopular and almost masochistic pitch characters. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife who hates him and a daughter who thinks she is a loser, which he is very much. His indecision and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he is too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan that falls apart and the mother is killed. The moment he gets up with his older brother at the end of the film, he is more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke interprets his character well, but he is not given much to work since he is portrayed as someone with a boot permanently printed on his face and does not particularly care that he is there. <br /> <br /> By the way, his character's wife is just as bad. Almost every single shot of the movie she is in is she verbally reproaches him for rent and money for child support and continues to grind into his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, that's all the character does. His harpy behavior borders on the wicked. Albert Finney plays the father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth Open a half grimace on his face as if he were suffering the worst attack of constipation in the world . For someone who was an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he would be better suited to emulate. Although he doesn't show much, his character is supposedly distraught and full of anger. And when he suffocates Andy at the end of the film, it is as if Dr. Frankenstein put the monster he helped create out of his own misery. <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei does not have much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy's world begins to move unchecked, it logically skips the ship, but in reality it doesn't make it any less selfish or selfish than any other character in the movie, but probably the one with the least common sense. <br /> <br /> And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason why I classified this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of heroin addict, misguided financial manager who it's "perfect crime" to steal his parents' assured jewelry goes wrong is mesmerizing. His descent from calm general planner of an imperfect scheme to an unstable and unbalanced homicidal maniac is credible and tragic. The character of Hoffman ends up being the criminal leader of the film, but it is difficult to surrender against him since the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father admitted as a self-taught bad parenting has led to the possible psychosis of the son and murder indirect and involuntary of his mother. <br /> <br /> Ultimately this film really deserves to be seen for the great PSH performance and for the nature of the family train wreck. Don't expect any characters to cheer about, because they really aren't.
