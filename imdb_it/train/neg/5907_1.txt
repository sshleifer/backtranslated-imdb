Yes, this summarizes everything. This film was horrible. Two minutes in which I wanted to dig my eyes. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not even good for the members of that church! I don't think any human being should be so victimized by watching a movie of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that no effort has been made at all in this film. It seems that the horribly squalid, casual and banal plot has been put together by two crazy weasels somehow imbued with the gift of a coherent thought (at least semi-coherent). Then, there is acting, which is sad to * everyone * involved. Even the cameos fail to revive anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget that our protagonist is a superficial asshole that we would like to believe can change, but that road is full of embarrassing bad dialogues, frighteningly horrible "gags" and a lot of Mormon "jokes" that anyone be right, LDS or not, should simply consider * stupid *! This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
