"Sundown: The Vampire in Retreat" is nonsense. The acting is terrible, the atmosphere is non-existent and the characters are not interesting. The only scary thing about this piece of scum is that most IMDb users have given it a 10. This is really terrifying. No blood, no suspense, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("The Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely wasted, even the supporting cast is terrible. Yes, someone might like this photo, especially a mainstream company, but hard-core horror fans or gore-hounds won't appreciate this piece of shit. Personally I hate horror comedies, I prefer to watch serious horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" or "Last House on the Left". opinion, a real horror film should be scary, overly bloody and disturbing, without stupid humor, which usually ruins the whole concept. This isn't scary, it's not gory, it's not even as fun as a play, so don't waste precious time
