Carlos Mencia continuously, violently, hatefully screaming "B ** ch!" women are like shouting "N ** ger!" to black people, except it's worse. Remember, the word B, unlike the word N, is the only pejorative term that is still associated daily with violence. "B ** ch!" it is the last thing women feel before being raped, beaten or murdered. This boy is perpetuating violence by hatefully using the language of violence. It looks like he may be a gay guy trying to cover himself with women, so he looks like a hetero. And what about all the white Nazis in his audience who give the fascist salute as their stupid white twin girls whine beside them, clearly terrified to protest this wave of hatred for women. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia does not believe or support freedom of speech for THEM! Come on, Carlos ?? do you want women to have freedom of speech for b ** ch-you slap strong, violent and big like you, or do you think "freedom of speech" is only for men to suck women ???
