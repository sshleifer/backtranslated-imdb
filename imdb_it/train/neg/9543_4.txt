Let's face it: if you've rented an STDVD sequel to a forgotten 80s gem, and you expected it to be better than the above, then you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary sequels that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this don't need spoilers, because you already know them. <br /> <br /> The "plot" of this "film" is as follows: Nerd meets the girl; the girl likes the nerd; the nerd loves the girl; the nerd is accidentally involved with the computer of the Top Secret Government; nerd and girl go to another country; the nerd and the girl end up being persecuted by government suits in the other country; the nerd and the girl meet some important old man who dies in the key point of the "film"; nerd and girl are caught; the Top Secret Government computer goes mad; the nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; the nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer as the first "movie" Wargames; the nerd saves the day; the nerd gets fucked. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> Acting, script, effects, score and cinematography are what you would expect: B-grade. Some familiar faces are here and, unless you're a big Colm Feore fan, you should avoid this. Sure, the movie won't make you crazy enough to eat your toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap STDVD sequels, then you're right at home. <br /> <br /> Sadly also Mathew Broderick involved with some "masterpiece", which could not even make a five-second cameo in this. But can you blame him?
