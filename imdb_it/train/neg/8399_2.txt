I'm a big Stooges fan but the one and only quality that redeems this film is that Curley is in it. Done long before he started drinking heavily, it's his classic self in this (and Larry isn't bad either). Moe's character is a straight part (mostly) and this movie would be called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Not that any of the Stooges films were very good (in my opinion), but as a commentator said here, it's sad that this film has real potential. The casting was good, it was well directed, filmed and edited, but the plot tried to talk about something serious with only a few Stooges antics and musical numbers (which I imagine were good then) thrown in. The best thing you can do with you during this movie if you really think it should be better to mow the lawn and take out the garbage (which is the subject of discussion) is to wait for the Curley / Larry scenes and sleep or find something in the kitchen from eat during the rest.
