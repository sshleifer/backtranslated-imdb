I'm sorry to say that this movie is really bad. It reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with a big difference: no porn. <br /> <br /> History and dialogue need a complete overhaul. Perhaps then the bad acting would not have been so obvious. At the very least, the pace should have been taken. <br /> <br /> While accepting that this has a low budget and the director did a good job visually, given the few resources he had, he would have to spend more time on the story or even better, ask someone else to write it. Many action scenes were simply useless. <br /> <br /> It was a total waste of my time.
