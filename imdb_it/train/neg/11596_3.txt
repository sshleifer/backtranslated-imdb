"The Dream Child" from 1989 is the fifth film in the "Nightmare" series (generally overrated) and at the latest from this moment on, the series has become total garbage. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's 1984 original and the third part, "The Dream Warriors" from 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and it was the fourth part where the formerly frightening madman Freddy Krueger started to annoy with constant idiotic jokes. This fifth entry in the series has almost nothing to recommend, except for the images (certainly grandiose) and a disturbing scene, a flashback sequence about how Freddy Krueger was born. The rest of the film is composed mainly of our joker-razor-maniac maniac who screams stupid jokes and the old formula of a group of boys, desperately trying not to fall asleep, because good old Freddy is waiting for them in their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a bunch of uninteresting crap, like a super-silent "mysterious" nursery rhyme, is added for no other reason than having some sort of justification for making this sequel superfluous and boring. .. In short: no originality, only a decline of the old formula, and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) 3/10 rating is due to the great graphics, and above all to emphasize the difference with the terrible sequel, "Freddy's Dead", which is horrible beyond all imagination. If you are not a fan of Freddy Krueger, "The Dream Child" should be avoided, and even if you are, it is more than likely that it will disappoint you.
