Supreme Teamo are three children, composed by their leader: Captain Crandall, Rope Girl and Skate Lad, all with their own battles (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And clothes and moves. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and playing that game. They also lead normal lives and have family and school duties, but most of the action takes place away from the bad guys in schools. The bad guys all have unique and singular characteristics, like Mr. Vague and his men who never seem to know what their plans are, but they still act. From an evil robot to an evil baron the three must meet them and stop their evil, and often strange, plans to gain power, take revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is quite beautiful and fluid, but the style seems to be purposely simple. The backgrounds have overlapping colors and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is quite nice, and the show is not bad at all, even if the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> The plots are almost always meaningless and ridiculous, but after all this is a cartoon and you can't blame them for that. However this would not be in the same position as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
