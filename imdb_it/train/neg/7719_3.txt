The simplest way to describe this film is like a satire. The goal of satire is quite vast, from the US government to American companies. Nor is it a pungent satire, but rather a fool. <br /> <br /> Think of this film as a mix between the Kentucky Fried series, Airplane and Police Squad, made on a much smaller budget and not as fun. I can see how this film is a satire of many sci-fi sci-fi films of the 50s and 60s. I see this film as a major influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. Genetically modified giant tomatoes become "crazy" and begin to attack people and cities. At the beginning there is a cover and then it explodes into a full-blown war. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the range of characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (a clone of Lois Lane), a very ambitious president Press secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked from the Bay of Pigs), a useless president (who seems only able to sign his name and attack New York), a Congress even inept, a bit shabby CEO of marketing, and the Mason team composed of an obese swimmer of the East Germany, a diver, a World War II parachutist and an expert on African-American disguises (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally tomato). I also forgot to mention, many and many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes, from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to split tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. They are not so good and seem to be nicknamed. The best melody is by far the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's too catchy and you could end up humming it or singing it in public. Watch out. <br /> <br /> Much of the film is quite funny and shows the absurdity of various real-life situations and various kinds of entertainment. I don't think I was led to laugh, but above all he smiled and scratched my head. I highly recommend this film for fans of B and C films, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
