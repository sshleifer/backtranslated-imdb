This film does not have much to do with its predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a nice premise of giant robots that fought each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this film and instead presents a totally boring story that, apart from that, is not very original or intelligently written. Too bad he tried to be very different from his predecessor, because otherwise it could have been a more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Just like "Robot Jox" this is a B-movie but with a big difference that is not very good. Perhaps this is also due to the fact that "Robot Jox" was made in the 80s, when the B films still had a certain charm and class, even if the film was released in 1990. This really cannot be said about this movie. He's just lame, badly made, poor and not exciting enough. It also has an ending that lets you think 'This is it? That's all? ". <br /> <br /> What the film in his story lacks is really a clear main storyline, perhaps a good main villain would have been a good idea and some other things like a real point in the story, some action or characters funny. <br /> <br /> Seriously what they were thinking when they chose the actors for this movie, all of them are not just funny in their roles and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves as if he were a gift from God for the woman and Mr. Perfect who can compete with anyone They were not even able to get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For a film so futuristic, with a concept of having "Big battle droids, this film certainly lacks its action. If they had included some bigger action in the film, the film would have been at least more fun to watch. But now we have a film that does not impress in almost every imaginable way. <br /> <br /> You can better watch an episode of "Power Rangers" by "Mighty Morphin", to have more action and sympathy. <br /> 3/10
