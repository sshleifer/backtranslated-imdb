Rating: 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> While this mini series was approaching, and we were well aware of it for the last six months, while the Sci-Fi channel continued to show its shows with BG ads, I confess that I felt a growing discomfort as I learned more. <br /> <br /> As with any cinematographic work that has stood the test of time, many people have worked to see different things. In this regard, when people think of Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some it is the warrior chrome with the red light oscillating in their visor. For others, it is the affection they have held for special effects that were quite evolutionary for their time. Many forget the state of special effects during the late 1970s, especially those on television. For some, memories are resolved around the narrative arc. Still others remember the reports on how the relationships themselves helped overcome the challenges they faced. <br /> <br /> Frankly, I come from the latter group. The core of Battlestar Galactica were the people who joined together to save each other from an evil empire. Yes, evil. The Cylons had nothing to gain but the extermination of the human race, yet they did. As the basic stars moved, men and women joined together to confront an enemy with practically unlimited resources, and somehow managed to survive until the next show. They didn't survive because they had better technology or more firepower. They survived because they took care of them and trusted each other to go to the next show. <br /> <br /> The show had its flaws, and at times it was cheesy, but they were people you could rip. <Br /> <br /> The authors of this current interpretation seemed never to understand it. He somehow took the less significant part of the original show, the character's names and a version of the narrative arc and created what they called nothing less than a reinvention of television science fiction. Because that was their goal, they can be judged based on how they achieved it: failure. He was far from a reinvention. In fact it has been in many ways one of the most derived from science fiction for a long time. It borrows freely ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. I find him unlucky. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been a contributor to popular science fiction for more than a decade, and has contributed to some of the most popular science fiction television programs you could hope to see. One of the difficulties that it seems to have had is that there would have been no conflict in the crew of the bridge of the Enterprise D & E. That was the inviolable rule of R: Roddenberry's ST: TNG. Like many who have lived under the rules of others who then take advantage of every opportunity to break the rules when they are no longer under that authority, Ron Moore seems to have forgotten some of the lessons learned from the well-known science fiction master: Gene Roddenberry. Here, instead of writing the best possible story, he created a dysfunctional cast like I've never seen him with the intent of creating as many casts as possible. Besides being dysfunctional, some of these were not the least credible. Anyone who has ever been in the army knows that someone who has unsuccessfully hit a senior officer would not have had only a couple of days "in hack", they could have gotten the execution and never come out the next day. It would not have happened, period, especially in time of war. The thing I remember most about Ron Moore's early work was that he condemned the death of Captain James Kirk. He killed Captain Kirk and, alas for me, he killed Battlestar Galactica.
