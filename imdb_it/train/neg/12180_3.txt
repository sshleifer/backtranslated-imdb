This film is absolutely horrible, but sometimes it can be hilarious, even if this humor is completely involuntary. <br /> <br /> The plot was beyond all limits. I don't even think a 2-year-old would be convinced by the ridiculous idiocy that the directors tried to slap in a story. However, on the positive side, some of the horribly inane twists provide a great deal of humor. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her backyard!" It gets worse (and even more fun), but I'll spare you. <br /> <br /> Acting is generally ridiculous. Most children's roles are pretty, but not very credible. On the other hand, Annie is pretty awful in the round. Adults don't take their roles seriously, but this is largely a good thing. If they had tried to be credible, the film would have been even worse. Which is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Once the overall film crap is overcome, there are actually some sensational moments of near-non-crap. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son escapes with the waitress is surprisingly fun, even if it's an annoying disappointment when they are caught by the police. The character of the butler, although very minor, is a ray of sunshine that almost, but never completely penetrates into darkness. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain. However, there were some parts that saved him making it almost watchable without starting to bleed internally. Judged for its good parts alone, the film would be around 5; unfortunately, the rest of the film barely deserves a 1. So, I give it a 3. <br /> <br /> This is pretty generous, I'd say.
