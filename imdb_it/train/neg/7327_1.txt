Moral moralism. Writers who use characters as spokesmen to speak for themselves. Unpredictable and predictable plot points (say five times faster). Imitation of a child of Britney Spears. This film has all the characteristics of a rejection for life. <br /> <br /> I honestly believe that Jesus Nebot and Julia Montejo have decided to create an exciting and stimulating film on a difficult topic, exploring the idea that things are not always in black and white, what by definition is a criminal is not necessarily a bad human being, and that there may be extenuating circumstances, especially when the well-being of a child is placed first. However, their seriousness ends up being channeled into a preaching dialogue and trivial situations planted to move the plot along. The decent production values ​​and the interesting use of the documentary style film are not enough to reach their goal when the script and the acting fall flat. <br /> <br /> Logic is often compromised to create tension: Soid first tries to blackmail Pablo to participate in his documentary in exchange for helping them escape, then in the same breath he basically tells them not to trust her because they don't he is helping with altruism. Well, duh. And for a man on the run, Pablo is too influenced by an outburst of anger. Cristina's well-being is so important to him that he flees from capture, prison or deportation for her, but is willing to risk all this to placate her when he doesn't want to go to Mexico. Right. Speak above too permissive parenting. Thirdly, when Pablo Charlie's employer gives Detective Bright the phone, he is remarkably unprofessional, especially given his seniority - did he really think he was persuasive? Oh yes, I would have changed. Detective Wims of CCH Pounder could clean the floor with her. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would like to list the things I liked. Um, I liked the dwarf. And I liked the fact that the dwarf was called Sexy. There is cross-dressing, always an advantage; youthful cross-dressing, nothing less! Harry is infinitely nicer than Cristina. But my favorite moment in the film must be when Cristina kicks Detective Not-So-Bright. I also find it interesting that, in a heavy minority cast (which I greatly appreciate, by the way), the black character is the racist one. Too bad it's just thrown out there and not explored further. <br /> <br /> There is a distinctive, unconventional score, but it is generally non-specific, does not improve mood or tension in any scene, except the pathetic, distressing lament whenever the main character is distressed, as if he thought his acting didn't prove it enough: "In case you weren't sure, he's upset, and we have the musical indications to prove it." <br /> <br /> Stunned and cliched dialogue leads to a depressing lack of subtext; everything must be stated in dialogue, even when the body language has been active until it has transmitted it well. For example, every passionate speech that Pablo makes, and the lament of Mrs. Knight that her baby will not crawl into bed with them in the morning. <br /> <br /> 'Papi, tell me again about the mother' - what a shameful display that introduces the dead generic wife! (She is always the most beautiful woman the widower has ever seen, the kindest I've ever met. Why can't we see a man crying for a woman like Shakespeare? She can be fat, ugly, hateful, but her love for her is as deep as the oceans? Now _this_ a story that would have moved me.) <br /> <br /> The police are always literally a step behind them and give many scenes the feeling of a French farce out of place. Most of the annoying foot chases of all time - Bright and Lightning are so out of shape and easily deceived (it's certainly not lightning fast, and she, well, I don't feel the need to spell things out). Some guy who drags a small child over a bicycle cop, complete with a macho biker who fights a fight but is then shot down by a child? To quote Margaret Cho, it's so sad. Could we ever see it on "Cops"? <br /> <br /> Hackneyed and over-the-top deus ex machina: as an employer, you really want to give up checking your green card just because you can quote the author of an inspirational saying on a poster behind your desk ? <br /> <br /> Also several scenes, including the previous one, threaten to turn into porn: "Well, I will do this favor for you, as long as you do something for me ..." I can almost hear the bow-chicka -bowm-bowm. <br /> <br /> When parents watch the footage shot of Pablo's remorse, the strange pain mother is the most real that the film feels. Unfortunately, this is diminished by the fact that she seems completely influenced by her emotional speech until she becomes ballistic. A more ambivalent aspect would be more convincing here. <br /> <br /> I am constantly impressed by the stupidity of the main character who does things for the sake of the plot: holding a maskless convenience store, visiting the dead girl's grave. And why doesn't the mother recognize her face since she saw him before he left ?! "You look terribly familiar ..." <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of that totally useless and somewhat free scene with Soid and the artificially enhanced bartender? Character development? Tch. Too little, too late. <br /> <br /> Speaking of unnecessary traits that never went anywhere, Detective Lightning is saying that the skeptical Detective Bright must be a Scorpio that shows how little he knows about the occult. And I don't think that believing in destiny can be considered a voodoo mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> In the end, when Bright keeps Pablo dying - wait, why do you care now? His character is as inconsistent as that of Soid. What, should she shoot him just because he said 'Stop, or I shot'? (She cares very much about her integrity so far.) He was unarmed. No need for lethal force. What's wrong with shooting him in the leg to immobilize him? <br /> <br /> Finally, Cristina's infantile acceptance of her mother's death that gives Dr. Knight peace over her daughter's death - so forced. And the expedient of the family whose child was killed becoming Cristina's new family ... It makes me angry that she can be a "substitute" for their child. It is also unrealistic for a white couple to take on the Latin daughter of the man who killed their daughter. I'm not saying that there are no generous and loving people who would do it. I'm just saying that the characters here have never been developed enough to make me believe they would. <br /> <br /> I find it offensive that another IMDb reviewer said that, of course, as a woman, she was moved from the sloppy scenes. I am a woman who reserves my emotional movements for moments that are not sentimental in a traditional way. <br /> <br /> Co-writer, co-director, co-star Nebot said he was wearing too many hats during this production. Too many cooks can ruin the broth, but a cook alone could end up creating an after-school special. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the title of this film has less to do with history and much more to do with a feeling of regret, helplessness and loss that accompanies the revelation that you will never see your money again.
