You might want a viable idea like "the invisible man" to work better and be handled more carefully in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally, the last 20 minutes of the film are fresher than a crazy mad scientist of the 50s. There are some great moments, especially because of the incredible special effects and the very idea of ​​an invisible man chasing the streets. But alas, soon we are back in the narrow prison of the underground laboratory, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic. <br /> <br /> There have been many remakes of old movies or TV series in the last 10 years, and some of them have their charm. But it's becoming increasingly clear for every film that the idea of ​​putting old classics under the nose of enthusiastic fools like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is really bad. It is obvious that money is the key problem here: the time and energy included in the script are not close enough and, consequently, "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined by clichés, mushy characters, predictability and lack of depth of any kind. <br /> <br /> However, the only thing that really impressed me, apart from the special effects, was the oath. When making this type of film, modern producers are very interested in allowing children to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, violence and sex) is very attenuated. When the whole world explodes, the good guys go "Oh, dammit!" and "Oh my God". "Hollow Man" gratefully dismisses that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are free to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something that went wrong is swearing - but it makes it more credible if SOMEONE actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for this.
