Oh my god what the hell happened here? !! I'm not going to say it again, but what kind of backlog is this? The dubbing in this is worse than the dubbing of "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller had to be the worst actress and the suits are really bad. It is on a villain named Dr. Anyone gets henchmen to build a gorilla robot that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks it builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (when Linda Miller becomes boring) he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes. Then Dr. Who sends the robot behind him. <br /> <br /> Later, when I was watching the movie, I had a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started complaining. As I sat through the suffering of watching the DVD while playing I was hoping the movie's madness would end until the fight. The ending had to be really bad because they could show Kong back on his island fighting the dinosaurs again. <br /> <br /> Do not watch the film under any circumstances or if you do ... beware of the disappointment you will receive.
