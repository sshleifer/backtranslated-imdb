I fully agree with Variety's review that the film is never so funny, lively or insightful about the creative process as its premise would seem to justify. Narratively it is messy and lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven, poor lighting does not improve acting and sometimes it is difficult to observe actors' facial expressions. Many non-South Africans will have difficulty following the English spoken in the film and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I saw the film at the Cape Town film festival of the world last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a welcome departure from the movies about our painful past. Unfortunately Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African New Wave, but some of the extraordinary films on our apartheid history will indeed be rated among the best in our 110-year history. No coincidence that the film disappeared from the Cape Town cinemas only two weeks after its release and from most of the cinemas in Durban and Gauteng. It has a clearly limited appeal among the South African public.
