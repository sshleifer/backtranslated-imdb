I'm sure Operations Dames was a drive-in favorite later in the day. There is absolutely nothing in terms of plot that you could lose if you were otherwise worried. And if you needed to get into the mood for other activities, you had shapely cutie on the screen to make you in the mood. <br /> <br /> Otherwise there isn't much that Operations Dames has. It is set in the Korean War, where a platoon of American soldiers along with an English gnat goes a little too far and must return to the UN lines. Bad enough, but these guys also meet a series of USO girls and their choreographer in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what is sad about this film is that it took generations of women to finally accept the army and in combat situations. These OSO bimbos have made the liberation of women in the last light years. In fact, not even the hard-bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it was probably better to remind someone of what they were at the drive-in for. This cast is no good to me by not recognizing any of them for an individual effort. <br /> <br /> Operations Dames is definitely a team flop.
