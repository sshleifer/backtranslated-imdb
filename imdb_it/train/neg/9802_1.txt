Many people here say that this show is for children only. Hm, when I was a child (around 7-9 years) I watched this show first. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other guys about this and, of course, other shows and I know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize the stupidity of something (on TV or in anything else) we said "Uh, just like the Power Rangers" and we laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there are actually MMPR fans. It was so strange for me that I decided to look at it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not like this vision. But it occurred to me: maybe I don't have enough imagination? Could be. However, this argument is not enough for me to classify it more than 1 star.
