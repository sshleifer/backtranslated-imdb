Probably the only thing that got the film up to four for me is the fact that I love Peter Falk. One of the greatest portraitists in the world of bumbling incompetence. . . yet it is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster. Like Pops Romano, it provides a respectable mix of gangster and man charm straight to the crazy madness of Chris Kattan. Reputable shows are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the tormented boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented FBI female agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk and Benedict Arnold's advisor. <br /> <br /> The concept of plot actually has wonderful possibilities and, in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase, could have been a great comic vehicle. Kattan, who seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, offers only confusion. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray his maladjusted brothers, are both very far from their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very funny scenes, but they are too few and separated by too many boring ones. What I really miss is what has always attracted me to Leslie Neilsen's films. There is no "second level" of spirit that rides the farce. No cultural references that only adults get. . no two-way. . It's just silly. <br /> <br /> And by the way, this does not mean that I recommend it for your 9 years, because we hope they have better taste and less charm for some of their body parts and their functions.
