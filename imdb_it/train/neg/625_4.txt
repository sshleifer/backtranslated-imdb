With all the excessive violence in this film, it may have been NC-17. But the blood could have been pg-13 and there were several curses when the mother had the friend of the bad-looking guy. There was a lot of character development that made the movie better to watch, then after the child came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a brainless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was excessively excessive and I think the number of people was more than twelve, which is a large number for films like this. Almost all the characters of the film are stabbed or severed the head, but the teacher who calls him "white trash" and "hoodlum" (even if the character lester is anything but a hooligan, not even close, I know the hoods and I do part hood, do not draw in the classroom, sit there and throw stuff to the teacher). The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than any other character, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two suspense scenes in the film, but they didn't last long enough to be scary. As I said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the plot get their heads cut off. If the gore was really fun to watch, then it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body they find in the cornfields, describe it as much harder than it actually was, they explained to the policeman that there were worms crawling in the intestines of the boys. His stomach hadn't even been opened, so there was no way the worms were in his stomach, although I would have liked to see it. The acting was pathetic, the characters were losers and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastic acrobatics. I suggest renting this movie for the scenes of death, I won't see it again soon, but I liked the excessive violence. Also, don't worry about the sequel, I watched five minutes and I was bored to death, it sounds good but it's not. In fact, the original scarecrow really interested me.
