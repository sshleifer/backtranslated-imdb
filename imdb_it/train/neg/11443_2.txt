Here's one you can look at with a straight face, with such a bad script, even Will Ferrell wouldn't be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. The Punch-Dance. Rod "needs to go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he is giving life to a passionate, exasperated bodyswerve for the tensions of a band that wants to have Europe's fake-big metal guitars. > <br /> 2. You're The Voice of John Farnham. In one of those epic sequences in which the star and her cohorts make The Slomo Walk on Main Street and the citizen follows on his heels in support, the soundtrack is the gag. Why did the filmmakers come across this Australian recording artist? A great Australian vocalist (and a real talent) who achieved notoriety in the early 1970s for Raindrops Keep Fallin 'On My Head, then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're The Voice, the hymn of John Farnham is so wonderfully cheap, he leveled the mountains in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two highlights of the film - both ruined however with the slippery writing - the rest of the film is like smothering someone else's vomit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who never made a leap. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he's driving a scooter in the heart of darkness. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, someone actually thought it was funny. <br /> <br /> Without a jump under his starry belt, he is planning an extravaganza of 15 buses - which would surely kill a minor comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his stepfather and at the same time eliminate cancer and so on ... who watches these films for the plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moral leaders in these plays), he marks a healthy chick (Isla Fisher), which must surely be delayed to consider exchanging the chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost phoned during her performance - then changed her mind and simply hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
