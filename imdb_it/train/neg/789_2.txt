five minutes after seeing this, I logged into IMDb to warn all of you out there not to worry about this movie ... genre: horror? he had moments of slight suspense and for the whole film I thought to myself "something must happen soon" was not ... when the film was finished I felt so embarrassed for the writer / director that I was never the most big fan of patrick rea this guy doesn't know how to make movies and after looking at this sorry excuse of a horror movie I went by was not the biggest fan of not watching another of his works .. <br /> < br /> I was greeted by the plot summary please don't make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors ... they weren't bad and it wasn't their bad direction ...
