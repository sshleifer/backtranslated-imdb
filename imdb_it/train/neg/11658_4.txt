Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, because there isn't much plot, bad acting, rather boring and some really trivial jokes. But. And this is great, but there is a good actor, a good recurring joke and a good start. The good actor is Tim Curry, the only recurring joke is the terrifying, strange butler with the disgusting hand who always does the cringey but laughs at worthy things. And the good start is the parody of the Excursist. <br /> <br /> The plot of Scary Movie 2 are the main characters of the original and a series of new characters along the way are invited to spend the night in an old house nightmare, but will they survive the night? This film is not very nice, but if you are bored you could even watch it!
