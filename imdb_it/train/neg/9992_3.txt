Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable film. I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately after the incident where, while the survivors were desperately looking for matches, at least half a dozen burnt fires ?? without an apparent reason ?? at various points in the wreck. Fire seemed to be a predominant theme throughout. They looked for corpses for lighters and matches, and finally found a box to light a fire every day, apparently, 12, but no one ever picked up wood. Then when the vegans (hah) burned their bodies, what did they use for an accelerator? I mean, were these guys frozen? well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature, everything he ate bleed. Maybe it's just me, but also in an absolutely incredible story (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the end), if you take care of the little things the bigger business becomes more acceptable . Oh, what does the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the film? And the revolver, warm enough to hold it, froze and didn't fire. Give me a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently adorable Canadian girl. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. <br /> <br /> Well, I might add that the rabbit that ate (although it looks like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if he had been a squirrel (or a mouse) he would have been a rodent, but he still looked like a chicken. And the writers have not had the opportunity to point out to someone "It tastes just like ..."
