* Sigh * Leave it to us Finns to take a stupid idea, swell it out of proportion and try to market it to the fullest. Lordi is at best a mediocre band, and a single device will only take you so far. <br /> <br /> For all the marketing idiots in circulation: this is the reason of the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when Finland tries to export something. <br /> <br /> Lordi is not scary. Lordi is lame. Lordi is ABOVE. <br /> <br /> I want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic-faced idiocy. Of course, they won the Eurovision. <br /> <br /> No, wait - Eurovision won. That's all. I have nothing to add.
