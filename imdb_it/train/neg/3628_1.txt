The dream of an art house. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; a pretentious m√©lange that not only did not deserve the Best Picture of 1951 for its merits, but was diminished by competition from the beginning. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the invisible man; call it, if it came out in '51, it's better than this crapola copyright. The closing ballet is crap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less capable (at acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My # 12 worst of '51 (I saw 201 films), and among the 5 worst Oscar winners.
