While three-dimensional animation (the highlight of the show) did its job well, most of the other elements fell flat. It was as if the filmmakers thought "well, it will be 3-D so we don't have to work so much on the plot or character development". And the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely not an excuse. The public is attracted to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's Dad) as much as they are attracted to three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that showed one of the main characters was the two-dimensional Scooter that from time to time distorts the plot with his compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? The appearance of Buzz Aldrin at the end (after seeing a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) arrives on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the "main characters" of the film and announcing that the situation was put forward on the screen was actually impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Did you just want to tell the children that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus don't exist while you're at it?
