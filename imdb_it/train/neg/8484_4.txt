"A cast of theater companies is terrified when a bizarre murderer known as" The Fiend "targets them for death: a couple of journalists and their clumsy photographer set to work telling the story of" The Fiend "and yes targets are found, how do you think our trio of heroes has solved the case, another breakthrough is being launched that is asking you who the killer really is, "according to the synopsis of the DVD cover. <br /> <br /> Taking "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" in Hollywood, the lack of studio settings by producer Sam Katzman probably helps "A Face in the Fog" to be interesting, especially towards the end (the 1930s traffic). The direction could be improved; for example, the angle of the camera on the combat scene is not useful. The budget seems slight. Under the circumstances, most of the silent crossover / talkie cast performs amiably. <br /> <br /> **** A Face in the Fog (2/1/36) Robert F. Hill ~ Lloyd Hughes, June Collyer, Al St. John
