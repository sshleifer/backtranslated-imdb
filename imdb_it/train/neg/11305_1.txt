This is a bad western especially because it is historically inaccurate. It looks like it was shot in a back lot in California, instead of where Jack Slade, Idaho, Colorado Territories and Montana lived and died. Imagine all that is known of this mysterious "bad man", "good man". The script is horrible; there is very little direction and bad acting. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to interpret this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a superintendent of the stage line. He was feared by his local inhabitants for his hard drinking. When he drank he would start arguing and cause more trouble in Virginia City, Montana. To make sure he could never terrorize them again, the vigilantes lynched Jack Slade after ignoring their warning to leave the city immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can't recommend anyone to watch this movie except to see how Hollywood takes history at will until today.
