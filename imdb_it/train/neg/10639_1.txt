Carefree, ignorant, ill-conceived, killer of careers (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), Rubbish profoundly inappropriate. It is no wonder that Reb Braddock has not directed anyone else since then - anyone who has the chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself, and creates something like THIS , anyone who believes that THIS was a story that is worth telling to the world, does not deserve a second break. Given the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told and do it well. It's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
