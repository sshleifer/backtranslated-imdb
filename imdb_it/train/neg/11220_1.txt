For a film with so many promises it was disappointing, subtly traced and the acting took place between the horrible and the unbelievable. The plot had more holes than Swiss cheese and is the worst end of a clich√© I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have ripped my heart out, if the whole movie hadn't been so painful to begin with. I was numb! From the first scene - one wondered if her sister was trying to reach her twin for help, or simply scaring her to death that it would be better for the audience and save us from two hours of the worst acting. I've seen until today. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
