I'm not sure what HK movies have been watched by other reviewers, but Enter the Eagles is by no means near the top of the heap in the HK action. Michael "Fitz" Wong should be glad he could get an acting job in HK, because he couldn't go to a wet paper bag in English. Shannon Lee looks good and is a fantastic fighter (even better with his father's leg fight), but his acting skills are also below expectations. In fact, all the dialogue in English (90% of the film - even more than in Gen-Y Cops) is so bad that I switched to Mandarin audio just to spare myself the misery of bad dialogue and the redundancy of English subtitles. Of course, there are some decent shootings (but nothing that we haven't seen before) and good cinematography, but the tasteful visual effects really ruin the action. <br /> <br /> That said, it's worth the admission price to look at Shannon and Benny "The Jet" Urquidez. Spectacular, and almost worth watching the rest of the film for. <br /> <br /> Finally, you might notice some scenes that seem "familiar" to you, in particular a shootout in an open-air market (think Matrix) and Fitz diving from a helicopter wearing a black suit (think MI: 2). I think someone thought it was worth at least a couple of things in this movie.
