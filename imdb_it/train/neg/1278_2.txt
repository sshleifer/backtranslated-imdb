Imagine a woman alone in a forty-five minute house where absolutely nothing happens. So this goes on two more times. Writing is flat and lifeless, and jokes are not fun, and bad acting prevents you from caring about any of the characters, even when they fight wolf packs and are beaten by members of the fraternity. Anyone who has rated this film higher than a two is not completely sane.
