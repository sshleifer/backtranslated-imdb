86 wasted minutes of my life. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and I must say that I never go to the cinema. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a useless plot play so forced, and can only assume that the actors were as tough as the lead writer supposedly was in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Everything in this terrible adaptation is outdated. And if it is not the wooden acting, almost as if you were seeing the teleprompter, then the apparatus itself, which is illuminated and interferes in ways that are completely superfluous and too unimaginably dressed, is enough to discourage you from the whole farce. <br /> <br /> Regarding the alleged shock of a detective in disguise, anyone who does not see that - like all the rest of this ridiculous plot - has telegraphed light years in advance, should check their sight immediately. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, and two very decent actors, coupled with the overdirection of the Branagh brand, hyper-coded, is enough to make you want to use real bullets rather than empty yourself. <br /> <br /> On top of everything, there is a completely laughable homoerotic undertone in this, intensified towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a flop that people will never try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.
