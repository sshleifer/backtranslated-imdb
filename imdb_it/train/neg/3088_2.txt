1. Aliens look like stuffed toys and hand puppets, even though their arms don't work. <br /> <br /> 2. Aliens have learned intergalactic space travel, but they don't know how to push an open armored door, but they can push a door closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. The old security guards know how to get a hold of C4, and they are just waiting for the right time to use it, for example, when they are suddenly fired for no reason to explain. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, the US Army training camp, in the 1980s, involved several "garden tool combat" sessions, including the pirouette of death. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your demure friend, you must "save the world ... err ... the neighborhood" from the aliens. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are sluts, openly or secretly. <br /> <br /> 7. Uncomfortable nightclubs look like ugly diners. <br /> <br /> 8. The "awkward" waitresses also act as dancers for Le Fontanelle (how did they talk about this?) Who can only do the bad dance moves of the 60s. <br /> <br /> 9. Private soldiers of the army secretly dream of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. The grenades apparently have a "flash-bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11. Apparently, being burned alive leaves only one with minor burns on the arms. <br /> <br /> 12. Sargeants of US Army personnel seem to always be in the area and do nothing about aliens in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Aliens apparently always "go home", which means going back to the vault where they were not blocked. <br /> <br /> 14. The aliens are attracted by bright lights, which apparently in the Los Angeles area the protagonist's house is supposed to be the most enlightened thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience sound better. <br /> <br /> 16. The vans of the 1980s apparently have horrible suspension systems. <br /> <br /> 17. The comedy should happen in this film. <br /> <br /> 18. Horror should happen in this film. <br /> <br /> 19. Spoofs and giveaways should happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> 20. This film treats insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools emit electronic keyboard noises whenever they are used, not just in fights (tell me I'm not the only one noticing). <br /> <br /> The simple truth is that this movie has just come out wrong. Period. There's not much meat on the bone, and it doesn't do anything really good. Even in the media. It's just ugly. However, I've seen a lot worse, and the rake fight scene is pure comedy of gold, intentional or not. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 was worse than this. At least the film never took itself seriously.
