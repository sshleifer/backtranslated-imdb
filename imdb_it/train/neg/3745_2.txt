First of all; it is very amateur to try to describe the way of history only from positions of guns, germs and steel. The same tried to make Marxists from economic positions. <br /> <br /> The reason for Western success cannot be just nonsense, the benefits of plants and pets. We see that all over the world any advantage and bonuses are useless unless they are managed wisely. In Japan there are not huge natural resources, but Japan is one of the first world economies, the same situation in Singapore, but in Nigeria, a country with rich oil resources, success is medium-low. Both of these nations had and still have access to technology and Western inventions, but why this gap? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, Daimond stated that it is very important to understand the factors of weapons, germs and steel, to UNDERSTAND. Perhaps the main factor of the difference in the world is not geography, but the ability of people to understand and use things? The mental capacity to understand. And in this case the geography is only subordinate.
