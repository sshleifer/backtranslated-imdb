I couldn't wait to see this movie. It's a good family film; however, if Michael Landon Jr.'s editing team did a better job of editing, the film would be much better. Too many scenes out of context. I hope there is another film in the series, they are all very good. But, if another one is made, I ask them to pay more attention to the editing. This story was everywhere and didn't seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other films in the series have been fantastic. I like the story of Willie and Missy; they are both great role models. Moreover, the romantic side of the spectators always enjoys a good love story.
