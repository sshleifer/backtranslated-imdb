I read the book a long time ago and I don't remember exactly the plot, but I remember I liked it. Since I'm sick at home on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It's a Lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The film is populated by actors and actresses of the series B. <br /> <br /> The female cast came out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show, but there are many commercials for the show and I get the essence of it. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not for life. <br /> <br /> The male cast are all pretty effeminate and reciting but the girls need to have husbands, I suppose. <br /> <br /> In a scene a woman is struggling with a male, for his life, and what does he do ??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love this, but let me tell you something about girls ... It's not as easy as it always was to look. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad at all. I've had shivers once or twice, so I have to give someone credit with that.
