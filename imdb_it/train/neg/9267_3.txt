After the already disappointing "Final Conflict", the series hit the bottom with this very weak fourth entry. At least the third film attempted (unsuccessfully) to continue Damien's story, while it simply resumes and copies ideas from "Omen" (animals are afraid of the Antichrist, a man's death is very similar to the death of the photographer in the first film). But what seemed exciting and creative there just seems stupid here. And the child just looks like a spoiled child.
