Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who is obviously trying to direct. "A Walk on the Moon" seems to have borrowed other better-made films. Current history takes place in the late sixties in a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock. Pamela Gray's screen treatment is not very successful, so it is an enigma because Mr. Goldwyn decided to approach this film as his first attempt at directing. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spends time at the resort. We see them arrive at the small bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the weekend; he works in what appears to be a small household appliance business that repairs televisions, above all. In a few days the first man will walk in space, so excitement is evident. <br /> <br /> The women of Kantrowitz are left behind. Perla, Marty's wife and her mother-in-law, Lilian, spend quiet days there until the "blouse seller" arrives. Perla goes to look around and she finds much more than a shmatte; she also receives the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sex life. After two children, Pearl, who seems to be sexy and with a good libido, is ready for extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> This is the basic premise of the film, which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter, Alison, decides to play with her boyfriend and go to the nearby Woodstock festival, where, a horror of horrors, she bears witness to her mother who makes out with the blouse seller! What should a girl do? Well, stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parts are happily reunited from the bedside of the little son when he gets stung by the wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy, and dad is called from the city, after learning about Pearl's betrayal the youngest stallion. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane went to make "Unfaithful" later, which is the high-level version of this disaster. Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who addresses his solitary female clients by whispering something small in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cuckold husband, doesn't have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebel Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana, who would like to have stayed in the city to watch her soap operas instead of witnessing a show in her backyard in person! <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk, or insert the DVD into the television when you have a fun crowd at home and really want to have a laugh, or two dishing of the movie.
