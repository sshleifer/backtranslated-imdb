The sense of rhythm, editing and the Japanese soundtrack must be different from American tastes, but surely this film could have been much more with a little more post-production work. <br /> <br /> Someone in Hollywood needs to make this film and I think it would be a great success. The story is interesting and creepy. There's something about the edges of the city, gritty cops, earthquakes, sanitary wares and mysterious saltwater kills that's enough to be captivating. However, this story must make only a little common sense and maybe be shorter than 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> I must say that the "sixth sense" effect was in full force in this film, and this was evident from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, only Japanese film lovers should die of worrying about seeing this film so boring.
