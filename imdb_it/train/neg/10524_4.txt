Actually, I intended to see this film in the theater. It has actually been sold out. Actually I went to see Solaris, which was actually the worst movie released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a robust street pharmacist, scares when he sees a child being shot so he decides to go clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack jumps the city with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so if they hadn't revealed it in the preview, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not. <br /> <br /> Actually, there is not a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you've also seen a preview, you've seen the entire movie, so you may simply want to really think about filling in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, save $ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the whole film, apart from how terrible the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone who was in charge of writing the soundtrack was fired. Twice. Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs that could be released were the duets of Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan and (I could break the plot of the space-time continuum with such a numb concept like this) both had less talent and musical skills. <br /> <br /> Acting is at best poor, the script is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at most 67% polystyrene and 33% ziploc bag. You know things go wrong when John Leguizamo (he was on The Pest!) Stages the rest of the cast with his acting skills.
