I needed an excuse to leave the house while the paint was drying - I left the movie after an hour to go back to looking at the dry paint. <br /> <br /> I don't remember ever seeing a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and continued to "come and go" badly - come on! Is Uma Thurman doing this stuff? Pretty lame special effects. They were older characters and actors who made superficial 20-screw horns - something just annoying and wrong. <br /> <br /> This review is based only on the first hour - it could be improved. I just had to go home and see if the paint was drying with a darker shade than when it went on.
