At first it looks like an interesting film, a Spanish thriller in an interesting Madrid of today, but it is nothing like that, in reality it is an interesting film only for future directors who are learning what not to do by making a film, can ". to be worse in other words, even the presence of a winning oscar (Mira Sorvino) is not enough to justify the $ 3.00 spent to watch this film, the acting is horrendous and it seems that the actors were just waiting to finish the newspaper shots to get home, it leads to nothing and is boring, weak and bad, we don't spend time or money on this movie.
