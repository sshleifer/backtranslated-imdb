A horrible looting of a classic. <br /> <br /> It was not convincingly written why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates. He can be more stable until they start messing with him, but he still doesn't help at all with his actions. (inviting a comparative stranger to be alone with him in his motel abandoned until recently, telling the attractive girl of his past mental issues, lying on knives, etc ...) This, in addition to his previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him, but this in some way does not happen just to be able to play the game of identity-murder wrong later. Which in itself is also ridiculous: "Such a killer is the real killer - more so too - he too! There were too many twists to slap a story on the screen when the narrative didn't need to be extended. <Br /> <br /> It was nice to see Perkins resume his famous role again, but this is the only small pleasure to have had. It's definitely not a patch on Hitchcock, and if you're not going to try to get close you shouldn't worry at all.
