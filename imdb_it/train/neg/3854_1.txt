Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who has great potential with the guidance of a reputable agent. Obviously, the person who guided her in this disguise is not a person who cares about her career. I sat in the theater, surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another film that snuck into the wonder of those who thought that this film could please anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.
