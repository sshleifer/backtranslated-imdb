I just rented Creep and I wasn't impressed at all. I didn't hear anything in this movie. I felt bad because the gore alone was shocking. <br /> <br /> I went out of my living room several times in desperation that something would happen with this movie. Haven't we seen all this before? I didn't like any of the characters screaming the boy in the sewer cage. I felt bad for him. But then again I couldn't think of why he was still alive and not murdered by Creep? Many questions must be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned references to the PS2 Silent Hill game and I can vaguely see the similarities. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, it's not a good movie. judge for yourself
