The statistics of this film have been well studied. There are no doubts! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it's no wonder this film received the praise he got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He looks so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this film, there are political news and references to his political career scattered throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a healthy man who not only speaks, but also walks down the street. When Carter thought we had to save energy, he lowered the White House thermostat and warmed up wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and says we are creating global warming while traveling in his private jet. How much energy does your jet use and how much more pollution does your jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's pool behind his villa? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off everything that's not being used. But if we did, the electric company would react to a 50% reduction in energy by calling it "a 50% loss of revenue" and recovering losses by raising rates by 50%. So "turning it off" would not be a good idea. <br /> <br /> This film is a veiled appeal to allow the Big Goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving the planet earth, that is.
