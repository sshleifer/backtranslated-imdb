So this guy named George is sitting at home alone on his birthday when two women arrive. George's wife is in a hospital that takes care of their child, so when his wife is out, George takes a bath and makes love with both girls. It's not a great scene because it doesn't actually show anything. After the birthday the boy wakes up and the girls are still at home. They make a good breakfast, but George is not hungry. George is not very happy and tries to get rid of it, but when he returns home the girls are still at home. The girls have had enough with old George and don't want to cook for them anymore. Both prove to be great psychopaths and use George in their little crazy game. I liked that the girls did what they wanted and pigeonholed George's house. George was not that good with his two guests. When George said he was a married man, he didn't really seem to want to say it. George looked like Tom Tucker in Family Guy. I've been for the two girls all the time.
