In a sense, Corridors of Time is a success story because the film achieves its goal: to be seen by thousands of people. But he can't make them laugh ... <br /> <br /> Les Visiteurs has had his success, because the theme was an original way to consider time travel: forget Zemeckis's Back to the Future, here it comes old France, the middle-aged knight and his almost barbarous lifestyle. Full of pride, amusing thanks to the ancient words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting but keeps his honor. Then comes the sequel. <br /> <br /> No one had foreseen the enormous success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it is useless to be a film expert to understand that the Corridor of Time has been made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs, and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a paradoxical time that would have needed a second thought. Explanation: it is useless to try to recover the jewels that Jacquouille stole; don't you remember this beautiful shiny and expensive red car that you bought at the end of the 1st episode? Where do you think he found the money? Sell ​​the jewels ... And this is just one of the many holes that Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the characters: Montmirail doesn't change, it's just a little more boring. About Frenegonde ... this is another story: Valérie Lemercier has decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the role of bourgeois. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so painful that I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré doesn't realize that a cast of humorists isn't enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget time travel, digital effects, focus on the story and you will see that there is enough space on a stamp to write 10 times. <br /> <br /> The main interest of this film is the landscapes. A film for children, let's say up to 13 years.
