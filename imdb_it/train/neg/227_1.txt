Should it be a serious play or drama? This film begins with a light joke between three women. Beautiful. She moves into a conflict between women when one of them meets a man. Beautiful. There are some antics between them. Beautiful. But when the plot thickens and eventually turns black, I started wondering if I had misinterpreted the first part of the film. Continue in this vein for a while until, at last, try to return to the original lines with a light heart. But it's too late. It is difficult to understand why these women still talk to each other and the ending is not convincing. Really a lesson (for British filmmakers) on how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers have ever convinced themselves that this film would work. And the box office turned out to be a real flop, because I had never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).
