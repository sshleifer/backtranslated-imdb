Yet another "child who will not grow up", and only the other recent similar items. Heder in another ugly wig, channeling Napoleon for, what, the third time? Anna Faris is forgettable, as always; Jeff Daniels called this in another state, at least; and Diane Keaton ... how do you become typecast late in a career? Do not bother. Nothing is said here that has not been covered many times. I will say this; it's about a hundred times better than "Failure To Launch". There are very few fun parts in the movie, unless you think Eli Wallach is swearing funny. Ha, Ha! He's old and he dropped the atomic bomb! Tee, hee, hee. Pitiful!
