I hate being the only one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this) but since the first scene, we could say that this film would have been absolute. It's really a pity, since I like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was intrigued by how they would mix together in a movie, but to my dismay, they didn't even have a scene together !! I think I have to repeat it - the two main actors (who stand side by side on the advertising posters and on the DVD covers) have not had a scene together !!!! They didn't talk to each other and never appeared on the screen at the same time. It almost sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False announcement. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every single character in the film was unrealistic and not human. The scenarios were far-fetched, the plot was disgusting, the lines were thin, Freeman struggled too much to be funny (and played a poor Tim man from the office), nobody was nice and, worse still, some of the characters were so annoying that it was almost annoying pushed me to shut down, as I could not bear to look, or to listen to them longer. <br /> <br /> This low budget stink was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer couldn't inject humor and charm into this, but bless, he tried. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> As anyone could classify this film as "ten stars" it is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I won't give even ten stars to the great ones, because ten stars indicate that a film was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, which means that it was almost completely disastrous. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you want, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and you've watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably be similar to mine. <br /> <br /> 1/10
