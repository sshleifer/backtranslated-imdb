How does a Scotsman make a love in bonny purple heather? Very, very carefully. I now have the distinct advantage over many other reviewers as I was born in Scotland. Too many Americans take this simplistic nonsense seriously. It's a joke, folks, "good legs - two bad legs", as Orwell had done. Jessica Lange emphasizes that the production of "Brigadoon" by Wells - next - the - Sea Amateur Dramatic Society would have been rejected. Liam Neeson - apparently popular with women - wears her skirt with the authority of a man whose great-grandmother once got off the train in Edinburgh Waverley. And the Auld Enemy? Where would the Scots be without them to hate and blame for everything? Messrs Roth, Cox and Hurt should be ashamed to indulge in such a racist stereotype. "Robin Hood - Prince of thieves" seems a masterpiece of historical accuracy compared. And at least Alan Rickman was fun.
