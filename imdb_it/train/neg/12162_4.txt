This is not horror, as the first part was: this is ("campy") light and fun fun. As in so many sequels, the action starts immediately without explanation. But there are boobs, so I'm not complaining. And the real tits they are. If I understand correctly, today they are quite rare among adolescents in the United States of America. The fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen comes to mind. <br /> <br /> This cannot be thought of without the first film, so I compare it. Also in this case there are too small clothes (especially trousers) and funny hair, it is not difficult to say in which period this film is made. Once again there are really strange characters, this time even more visibly "pathological". Especially the camp staff. It's like a summer camp for mental rehabilitation. People are older: most of the actors must be at least 25 years old, but I think they should be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by Evil Dyke are rather unpleasant. In reality this film does not have much in common with the first part, and this is worse than it is anyway.
