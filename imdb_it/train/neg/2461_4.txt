There are probably more people who fear the dentist than, for example, little monsters or scary-looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really. <br /> <br /> Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years, but when he catches his wife betraying him with the poolguy, he takes his anger and frustration to work. Well, give a crazy dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what will happen next ... <br /> <br /> Like I said, a brilliant idea but not delivered as it should. In particular, the ending is a huge disappointment. Last note: look at Mark Ruffalo (You can count on me, Eternal Sunshine ...) in this. <br /> <br /> 5/10.
