In my class lit. we have just finished the book, Hatchet, and this film is not like the book. (1) Brian has never eaten worms in the book. (2) He did not know the name of the pilot. (3) His mother betrayed her father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man with whom his mother cheats has no black hair, he has a blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie: (1) A 13-year-old cannot punch his fist through a window. <br /> <br /> And for acting, the guy who played Brian was a horrible actor. <br /> <br /> However, I believe the scenario was impressive, although I strongly doubt that the director has also read the book. <br /> <br /> This film is good if you haven't read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you have it, then start a letter of complaint to the director.
