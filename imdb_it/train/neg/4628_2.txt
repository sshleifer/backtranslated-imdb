Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's all about this movie. Fist of pure exploitation. I started playing with myself, counting the number of times they linked the original orchestral music. And of course the music is completely foreign to the scenes. Case in point: accidentally walking in a room and saying "Hello" was marked with the hunting music of a Roman epic poem. I'd like to know why this film stayed on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: women's low-waisted panties existed in 1954. I'm talking about Sigourney Weaver in Alien's original panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes are Misty who undresses quietly and puts on clothes (except for the bra and panties, sadly). Also includes the horrendous dubbing, which leads to a "Look out! Godzirra!" effect.
