Looking at Smother was perhaps the longest non-90 minutes of my life. There wasn't a laugh to have; in fact, I don't remember having ever smiled. Diane Keaton was horribly unpleasant as a bitch-aged, middle-aged dog-smoker, mother-of-text-book character, an inexorably irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and, worst of all, boring. I suppose I should briefly mention the other characters, but why worry? It was just a long series of cinematic clich√©s - the distant relative of taste and socially inept who is only trying to get into "The Industry", the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father, the mild wife who can only 'Don't I do it more (but in the end it moves beyond discord and returns resignedly home), the pack of stoned dogs who love to chew pillows while everyone is away, etc. <br /> <br /> God, who snores. I've never been a fan of Diane Keaton and Smother just reminded me of why. Overacting is exaggerated, no matter how many photos you took in your first one. His attempts at physical comedy were particularly humiliating. What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> Although I like Dax Shepard and sometimes I can tolerate Liv Tyler, their performances were so dull and boring that it was clear that neither of the actors cared about this movie. It was fine, because neither did I. Keaton's endless fooling around was intolerable and sometimes Shepard's dislike for her seemed genuine. At the end of the film I wanted to slap her alone. <br /> <br /> Horrible.
