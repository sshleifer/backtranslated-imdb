This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among several Vietnam War veterans reborn to be perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this, I believe, about a dozen years later, given that Van Damme has a daughter of that age. He is now working with the government on a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the on-site super-computer (called Seth - like the snake in "King Cobra" in the same year) becomes mad with power, takes command of the Unisols and even unloads its computer brain in a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We're looking at the next step of evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's fights are with a particularly peculiar Unisol (the professional Goldberg fighter) who keeps coming: throwing him out of a building - it's not good; escort him with a truck - don't go! Shoot it, burn it, forget it! Much of the humor is due to the way Van Damme is out of date and out of class (it's even turning gray around the edges). But, even if you take a lick, keep kicking! Most sequels of this kind are almost crippled imitations of the originals, and while this is certainly not a stroke of genius, it manages to be constantly entertaining, especially if you're a wrestling fan.
