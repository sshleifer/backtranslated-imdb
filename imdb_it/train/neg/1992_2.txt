Don't let the name of this movie fool you, actually Jake Speed ​​is probably the laziest action hero I've ever known. When Jake Speed ​​does not save virgin girls from evil fools who are often not, he is seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to its charm, but in my opinion an action hero should not "relax" whenever he has the chance. Moreover, unlike other daring heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless he is called a talent. However, this film is fundamentally worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there are some, is very weak. (The machine guns on the jeep weren't bad, but that's all.) So if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero who doesn't just get to sleep, but also his audience.
