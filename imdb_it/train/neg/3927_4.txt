A horror story so common on a luxury building in Brooklyn that hides the gates of hell. Remember the Polanski movie "The Tenant" (released a year earlier "The sentinel"), but it is too far from the Polish director's film in every possible aspect. "The tenant" was so disturbing, while "La sentinella" is not at all. <br /> <br /> What is most surprising about this film is the cast: it's full of big names in American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors acting for food (I suppose). Verdict: barely funny. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
