I saw this movie years ago, and I was impressed ... but again I was only 12 years old. I recently saw him and I want that time back. This movie is pretty ugly. While I like Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you'd like to see a GOOD movie that was in ... by Meatballs (also played by Bill Murray) for some laughter), and Burgess Meredith, this role does / did nothing for their careers. <br /> <br /> However, the character of Lee Majors, Franklyn Hart, is a former car driver who plans to drive his race car (which he had in storage) across the country for California. One problem: the government has outlawed all private transport. I thought the concept was OK (not the worst I heard of), but the execution failed horribly.
