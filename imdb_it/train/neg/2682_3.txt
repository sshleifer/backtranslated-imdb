I couldn't wait to see this movie for a long time, after seeing "Return to Paradise", which I found to be gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending that I think was partially stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didn't like the character of Danes and first of all I found it very boring. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see anything realistic about the movie. Much better could have been done, for example there could be more emphasis on prison conditions and pure horror. It was a film too cheerful to be realistic. There could also be more action and tension <br /> <br /> The best thing about this film is the "tragic" ending. I couldn't predict it. But at that time I didn't really care what happened to him. <br /> <br /> 3/10
