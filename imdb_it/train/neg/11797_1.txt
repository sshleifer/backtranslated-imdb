Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and $ 2 in rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before you die, this will be the greatest regret of my life. Who ever thought of this film, or funded it, deserves a kick between the legs, because that's where they were thinking when they made this film. He is an overweight boy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes a pretentious fiction that he tries to convey as poetry. He joins his loving friend on a journey to the coast. Where they meet girls and so. Only the fat man doesn't take a girl. Skin gestures don't bother me, I take them for their face value. But this film tries to be more than a skin film. It's about the fat guy looking for love in some girl, but then he meets another silicon girl who loves his poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, he gets money for his family and impresses women, only he still has his woman. The dialogue is super-horrible even for a C movie. It supports a lot of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie, with no porn in it. Never ever watch this movie.
