For those who are too young to know this or those who have forgotten, the Disney company almost fell apart in the late 1980s. People no longer saw their films and society was not producing the usual healthy material ... at least not what people expected. Big deal: bad words. <br /> <br /> Yes, the idiots who run Disney films during that decade will produce films with bad words - including the name of the Lord in vain, if you can believe it - interspersed with these "film families". it happens twice here in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> This film, in addition to the linguistic problems, also has an unpleasant tone, which made it almost unlikely from the beginning.Fortunately, Disney woke up and produced a lot of great material from those decadent films of the 80s. ("Touchstone" is Disney, just under another name.)
