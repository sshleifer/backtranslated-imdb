Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into television series. When a job he has begged for goes wrong, he is fired. Even her beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara. Back home, Tim is surprised to find that his home has an uninvited visitor (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Calling him Uncle Martin, Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate the land. But Martin gets himself in trouble wherever he goes, from the bathroom to the laundry and more. The beautiful Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees an opportunity to take time with Tim, but in this case the path of true love is not smooth. Soon everyone on television is persecuting Tim, hoping for a story about a real alien. What should a man do? For those who loved the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this film is not worthy of tying the proverbial boots. It's really, undeniably terrible, without plot and an addiction to supposedly special effects that fall on the flat, too. Daniels is fine as an Earthman, but Lloyd is just as terrible as the alien, who storms a storm. The rest of the cast is adequate, as are the costumes, the ensemble and the production details. Even if your kids see the cover and beg for this movie, convince them to choose another movie in the video store. Be assured, children and adults will find this movie a colossal marker, so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 days.
