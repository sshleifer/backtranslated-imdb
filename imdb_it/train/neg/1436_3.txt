Oh dear. Some of the best British TV talents have made this serial, so I can only assume that they were working under an impressive amount of time and had to settle for the first takes of many scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some scary scenes in this Highland mystery (especially when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story unintentionally funny! Like the moment when the hero discovers a corpse dismembered on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a little disconcerting ... <br /> <For many years fans of British cult TV series have campaigned to publish this serial on VHS or DVD, but the BBC has always said no. Now I think I understand why!
