Georgia Rule must be one of - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole film has a very surreal feeling that made me jump, "what?" aloud at least 7-10 times during its grueling two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Advertised in its trailer as a film about three generations of women - Jane Fonda as matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan, her rebellious, overcrowded and skilfully dressed niece, the viewer thinks that this will be a clich√©, light, fun to grow and be together as a family. <br /> <br /> Talk about false advertising at worst. <br /> <br /> After many animal shots that do "funny" things against the background of "key" scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focused on an old woman who enters a doctor's office weekly to change her diaper, or the fact that this film is about the character of Lindsay Lohan sexually abused by her stepfather, Georgia Rule creates her kind of cinema: the bottomless, horribly acted and inappropriate comedy that addresses extremely serious issues in the most embarrassing, surreal way , strange. If Garry Marshall wanted this film to be a drama / comedy, then he would have to watch The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can make a reader understand the horrible genre headed by Georgia Rule is to create a hypothetical situation. Say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, spoke of the fact that the main character was unmarried because he had been sexually molested as a child. But instead of making the film take a more dramatic turn, there would be laughter and comedies, with all the reactions of the characters that are false human beings, lifeless, pretending to be interested. <br /> <br /> Throw a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest and non-dimensional character that could have been completely cut off from this poorly written script, along with a male character who throws away all his religions beliefs and moral of being with a scruffy girl, too tanned who does not share any of the same interests as him, as well as a chase scene in useless car, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you have Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I found this film as an insult to all those people out there who are fighting for directors, screenwriters, actors, publishers, etc. who are much more talented and have not noticed. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you must, drink enough in advance.
