customs, dialogue, historical accuracy are terrible. For example, - Stacey Dash and the suspended scene. The noose was accurate (as far as I could tell), but that kind of noose broke the person's neck. Ms. Dash hangs at the end of the rope with no ill effects until the rope has been fired. This type of did not strangle the person, killed them at the end of the drop. <br /> <br /> And just before they go to rob a bank (in a flashback), they stop in the street for a group hug - with their bandanas hiding their faces - which would have been obvious to people on the road. <br /> <br /> Poor editing - which is a battery under that shirt and it's obvious, the "long journey" clip shows them riding, then reverses the film. I liked the fact that they held the scene with the horse that took a shit - it seemed symbolic. The whole movie was bad.
