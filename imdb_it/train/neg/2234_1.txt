I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. The acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are poor at best. The plot has little sense even when it's sober (WARNING: I don't recommend watching this film when it's sober.) This film seems to be watching the home movie of someone who doesn't go out much. It's really a shame that all the little money spent on this project has gone to ruin, I can't wait to see if any of these still have a career, in addition to the eva longoria that is the only "star" of this film apparently was not hit by the bad stick. I'm sorry that none of these criticisms seem constructive, but I'll tell James Cahill one thing, don't try again. In the words of squirlyem "His serious lack in the good department".
