Although not exactly offensive, the 1967 version of "The Perils of Pauline" is certainly one of the most grandiose. The title could lead you to expect a tribute to Pearl White (the original Pauline in the 1924 serial in silent 20 episodes), but this would have served you better in the 1947 version with Betty Hutton. This 1967 version is like a mix of "Casino Royale" and the weakest of the Elvis movies. Worst of all it is not a mixture of these, but more like a scotch-recorded segments from each other so that the thing jumps back and forth between the two styles. <br /> <br /> The unity that exists in the production derives from the association between Pamela Austin (Pauline) and Pat Boone (George Steadman), a good correspondence because they lack even the most elementary acting skills (imagine Mandy Moore playing alongside Dan Quayle). <br /> <br /> Austin then starred alongside John Aston in "Evil Roy Slade", with the disparity of talents between them actually painful to watch. In the mid-1960s she was the "Dodge Rebellion" girl, as he was the protagonist of a similar series of dangerous situations - imagine Sandra Dee in a dark blue suit. When the car agency's advertising agency replaced it with the girl "Dodge Fever", someone had the brilliant idea to put it on display in a feature film. <br /> <br /> The story here begins with Pauline growing up in the Baskerville Foundling Home run by the actress who played Ms. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. in "Dobie Gillis". George falls in love with her (Pauline, not Mrs. Osborne) and sabotages several opportunities that must be taken. George leaves to seek his fortune and Pauline, 19, receives a job as tutor to a young oil-rich Middle Eastern prince. When he tries to add the attractive blonde to his harem, he runs away from danger to danger. These include African pygmies, a 99-year-old millionaire who wants to freeze it until his one-year-old nephew is old enough for marriage, the film industry and the Russian space program. <br /> <br /> All this is destined to be foolish and fascinating but it only manages the foolish part. There is some effort to incorporate an aspect of the silent film into action sequences by simulating the undercut of a camera (which accelerates action). Unfortunately everything else (film, production, editing) is depressed in the 1960s. Nothing even comes close to the images of Pearl White tied to a log that moves towards a circular saw or tied to the railway waiting for the approaching train. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
