Quote: theurgist: anyone with an I.Q. more than 50 would have seen this movie what it is, a well interpreted and intelligent prequel for a modern classic, yes, it doesn't have a successful cast or a huge budget, but it is still very well done and made me fall in love for the duration . <br /> <br /> An IQ over 50 years old you say ... this means that you have an IQ. less than 50 .. his name is CARLITOS WAY: Rise to power !!! in the sense that it should have something with the first one to do .. <br /> <br /> everything and a whole movie OK if .. CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO CHARACTER HAS APPOINTED CARLITO BRIGANTE !!! <br /> <br /> Ps don't comment on a movie if you know nothing about the movies. but I imagine an I.Q. under 50, you won't know what the hell I'm screaming ... <br /> <br /> Peace out !!
