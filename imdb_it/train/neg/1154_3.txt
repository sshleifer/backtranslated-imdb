May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are making a seemingly rare visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even at the beginning of the visit, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, insecure, and questioning his life and his future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter Darren's (Daniel Craig) boyfriend, her actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but despite everything for its realism and its applause, The Mother offers a collection of unpleasant, even repellent characters and asks the viewer to interact with them. Reid shines like May, and it is his skill and his commitment as a wonderfully underrated actor who saves the film from a completely depressing quagmire, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such hateful characters, which always becomes more difficult to cure what happens in May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually so totally selfish and cold that one begins to wonder what exactly Kureishi was trying to say. As indicated, they are reluctant or unable to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensions in their horrible selfishness. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing for Reid's performance, but little else. A shame to cry ...
