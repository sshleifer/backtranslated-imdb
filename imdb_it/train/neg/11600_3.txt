After the success of Part 4, another sequel was a natural move. However they should have stopped him before he started. Alice, who survived part 4, becomes pregnant and it seems that Freddy is using his unborn child to take his victims, who are obviously Alice's friends. Strange Nightmare movie, very heavy for religious images and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the film is not.
