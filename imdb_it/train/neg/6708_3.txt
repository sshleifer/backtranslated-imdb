Turn your back or you'll be in trouble out of MY CHILD! Only a happy ending can blossom into your innocence that is full of sadness and ruin the moment you are looking at this. It can be said with certainty that the whole film falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and a tribute to the zombie shows that defy nonsense to the maximum. We have a name like "Johnny" from time to time, and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no specific reason why our "dead corpse" crawls out of its grave only to survive until the night of the dance, in order to make the film totally useless. Without a feeling of pain, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Later, Johnny bites Eddie's arm. The observer is asked a difficult question: why must the film be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all living persons or death is purely coincidental. "Living" is a coincidence. "Dead" has nothing in common with the film. Show this to your girlfriend and skip the prom, turning your life into a desert ruin. Blah !!!
