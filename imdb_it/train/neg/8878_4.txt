Judy Holliday played gold in 1950 with the film version of George Cukor of "Born Yesterday" and from that moment on, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to hit gold again. <br /> <br /> never happened. In "It Should Happen to You" (I can't think of a blander title, by the way), Holliday still makes a variation on the stupid blonde who is perhaps not so stupid, but everything about this movie feels warmed and half heart. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe is his first film role, can't gather enough energy to animate this recycled comedy. The public knows how the film will end from the beginning, so mostly it just waits for the film to resume. <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're in love with Holliday you'll have fun; otherwise I wouldn't worry. <br /> <br /> Vote: C
