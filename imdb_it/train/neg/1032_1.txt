Even though I've never been a fan of the original Scooby-Doo (because of its horrendous production values), it seems like Shakespeare compared to this pile of shit brought to us by Hanna-Barbera! Without a doubt, Scrappy-Doo is the most annoying and terrible character created for children (and this includes Teletubbies and Tommy the Tapeworm). Who was the brilliant idea to create a kind of short, mutant little dog and enable him to talk and then saddle the Scooby-Doo characters with it ?! Anyone deserves to die or watch this show (I think death is preferable). The bottom line is that the little dog is simply not funny, annoying and grateful on the nerves - and this is only in the BEST episodes !! After many years, it would have been better to end the franchise than to create this mess! I can understand why in the movie Scooby-Doo live-action they did the bad Scrappy-Doo - since almost everyone hates it!
