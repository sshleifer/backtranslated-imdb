For two of the funniest comedians, the film was terrible. Fast forwarded and never better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought she would be so good at comedy. The previews were fantastic, but they only showed the best parts of the film. My husband also thought that for a chicken movie, it sucked. What happens with that. The film was very slow and boring. I won't recommend it to anyone right now. I'd like my money back for this! BOO from us here in Arizona. No thanks. Who does this kind of stupid thing to make people believe you're pregnant? I thought it would be so fun, I had my children and I helped others have children. It could have been more like reality.
