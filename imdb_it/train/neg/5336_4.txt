This film is not very beautiful. In fact, it's the worst Elvis movie I've ever seen. It has a very small plot, mainly party, beer and combat. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they made this film. You could say that Elvis was wasted too, it's much, much better in "Follow That Dream".
