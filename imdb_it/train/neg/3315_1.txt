Bah. Another tired and occasional reworking of a copyrighted work of art has never been designed to be filmed. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, Toni Collette is superb as always (being a real actress, see), and there are some well-managed handover cuts between the scenes. There are also some really funny jokes, and the film, the score and the editing are competent, apart from a bizarre interval in the voiceover and talking to the camera towards the conclusion. <br /> <br /> But, ah, but. Most of the cast seems to be in autopilot, and almost all are very clearly too old (and in one case too young) for their declared age. Worse, they are all talking about "Austinese", that singular self-sufficient falsetto who sings a song that could not be further from the way people spoke in the days of Austen (think of Yosemite Sam, I'm not kidding). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally see the disappearance of the equally farsesco "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his cronies loved so much to shout at the top of their lungs. <br /> <br /> And the worst of it all is Gwyneth Paltrow. In his films he has always played only one character, and remains true to form here, covering his entire range (grinning) in the first ten minutes, then repeating himself for the rest of the film too long. There is absolutely no connection between her and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her. <br /> <br /> In short, there is little reason to look at Emma. It's a pretty lovable adaptation, but if you're going to pack a movie full of anachronisms (ie a seemingly thin leash that doesn't know how to draw a bow or handle a period accent), then you might as well do it correctly, as with the enormously superior "unaware".
