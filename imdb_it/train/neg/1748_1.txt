Don't waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack ... There was such a loss of performance by some of the excellent actors. The film does not do justice to Paresh Rawal, who is perhaps one of Bollywood's most talented actors. Akshay Kumar, who is also an emerging star, did a fairly mediocre job. John Abraham, what's wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God for having a pretty face or he would win the Razzie prizes in India if there were such prizes in Bollywood. Asrani is a great talent, but he wins as before. <br /> <br /> The script, not to mention a Boeing Boeing 1965 trap, was rather battered. First of all, people in Bollywood fail to create something original. Moreover, they don't even know how to copy well. The jokes in the film were so exaggerated, it was painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan could be a star in the south, but it is not suitable for making a decent Hindi film. The sound editing is incredibly bad. I can go on and on this question, but the conclusion is that Bollywood should be ashamed of making a film like that. The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What's wrong with you guys? This is why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more Hollywood movies every year, however, most movies are unknown abroad due to films like this. I'm an Indian and I'm absolutely ashamed of Bollywood for producing this thrash piece. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were simply fantastic. They are world-class films that are timeless ... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century. Period. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1 out of 10.
