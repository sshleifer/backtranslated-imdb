Stilted, stagy, weird and dull, if visually striking ... an erotic-aspirating fantasy. Really boring, too much male nudity (including father-son incest), and just a kind of shameless nonsense. I will confess, however, that some passages of dialogue, taken on their terms, have a lulling and bewitching quality.
