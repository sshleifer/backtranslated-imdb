I don't know why I keep doing it for me !! I continue to defend Dutch and Belgian cinema and I argue that it should have more credit and possibilities ... and then they slap you in the head with garbage like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that has ever been done in Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our horror franchise, clearly based on classic American slasher like Friday 13 and Halloween. Producers and writers have aimed very high with this, but they have really fallen low. Intensive Care has become an embarrassing product for all those involved and therefore a true cult film here. It is almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and is shown only on special occasions, such as "The Night of Disgust". For exactly 5 minutes, intensive therapy tries to tell a story and even create a plot ... then it turns into a limping and brainless film, with macabre effects - but very funny and cheap. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, although there are some respected names involved. The main male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy could also be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He is a much loved singer, host of television programs and idol of many young girls. He never mentioned this thing in which he acted, though. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he is trying to convince himself that Intensive Care never happened.
