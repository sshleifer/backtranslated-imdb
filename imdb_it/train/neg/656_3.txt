Note: I couldn't force myself to write a constructive review of Prom Night. It cannot be done. Instead, I switched to what I thought while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Things I thought of while watching Prom Night: <br /> <br /> -I'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place, only the main character wakes up before she bites him. Of course, when I say "elaborate deaths", I mean gashes of throat or stabs in the stomach. Wasn't the whole thing "just a dream" ruined by Dallas? By the way, I wonder if a few stab wounds in the intestines will cause immediate death. <br /> <br /> - The film is only ten minutes away and I can already count the clich√©s of horror on two hands. It is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> - Even after having just met the protagonist's boyfriend, I am convinced that he will die. Does anyone want to place bets? <br /> <br /> - The killer in this film is a teacher obsessed with the protagonist, Donna. (By the way, does anyone think that "Donna" is a horrible name for a main character in a horror movie?) She spends three years in a maximum security prison before bursting and finds Donna celebrating the prom. Although there is no accounting for taste, I seriously wonder who would take all that time to persecute someone as boring as Donna. <br /> <br /> - High schools allow proms to take place in hotels and do not keep track of students. Apparently the students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and come and go as they please. I suppose if this point of the plot were not in place, the film would be 90 minutes of people bored by their mind and randomly bite the dust every time they go to the bathroom. I suppose the compromise for their excitement is my total boredom with everything. I have already played "counting the pieces of chewing gum under the seat" and "guess how much money I have in my wallet" and I am only in the sign of the 20 minutes. How else will I have fun? <br /> <br /> - Notes to self: don't forget milk and bread on the way home. <br /> <br /> Script writer: you used enough fake flaws to get past this movie and every other horror remake this year. <br /> <br /> - The 1980 version of this film was not that good but compared to this remake it was like Citizen Kane, or at least The Godfather. He had Jamie Lee Curtis in one of his many horror post Halloween movies and eventually had a little twist. I miss Jamie Lee. I would like you to play more. <br /> <br /> - Obviously there is not much to dance at the dance. Instead the girls argue with their boyfriends about where they plan to go to college. I've heard of all these colleges by name, and I can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat during the entrance exam to enter. <br /> <br /> - The murderer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning products and clean his mess between the scenes. This is the only logical explanation of why he can stab someone to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and when someone goes up to the hotel room, there is no sign of a fight. (From another note: this is a very lazy killer: Michael Myers went hunting after his victims.). <br /> <br /> - It's official: the whole audience in the theater is rooting for the killer. What triggered it? Was it every time Donna returned to her hotel room while the sirens went away ordering everyone to leave the building? Were his dreams constant, and how, even after going through something dramatic in that dream, did she insist on re-staging her steps for a t-shirt? Or was it Brittany Snow's unconvincing performance? I must say that it was all of the above. <br /> <br /> -Okay, who had "died off the screen in the third act"? Win the pot. <br /> <br /> - Finally, the film is finished. My friend turns to me and says "Donna wasn't too smart." This is the euphemism of the week. A bit like saying that a tornado is a small gust of wind, or a week's power outage is a small inconvenience. <br /> <br /> - I can't wait to get on Rotten Tomatoes and see if anyone gave this move a favorable review. <br /> <br /> - I can't recommend it. I refuse to recommend it. This is the laziest of a horror movie, and the only way to enjoy the texture of its smell of cheese is if you're under the influence of at least ten beers. And unfortunately for theater customers, alcohol is not served. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: * out ****
