"Whipped" is 82 minutes long. This review is 82 words long. Three unlikely New York Lotharios, ruthless "scammers" end up courting the same woman, played by Amanda Peet, with disastrous results. This applies to the story and the film. Too sophomoric to be misogynistic, flaccid and ridiculous, "Whipped" blends Tom Lykis' shock jock philosophies with Penthouse's letter fantasies. Although technically expert, he is dated, grated, badly written, bad and obvious. People don't behave like that. People don't talk like that. Really.
