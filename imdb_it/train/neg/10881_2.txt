My friend's mom worked in a video store and had the opportunity to watch the movies before they came out, so when she brought The Convent home, a horror movie, I couldn't wait to see it. Since it should be scary but actually really hilarious, I can say that in some strange way, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK ?!" I didn't know this movie was ever released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... overall the film is pretty ugly (you have to admit it so much at least) but I promise you, you'll have a good laugh. <br /> <br /> * this movie sucks but it is good for a laugh ... especially that guy who holds the 'dagger of despair' .. THE DESPAAAAAAIR DAGGER!
