Revenge is one of my favorite themes in the film. Moreso, "the uselessness of revenge" is one of my favorite themes in the film. Having seen Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I expected an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak and unconvincing attempt that has expressed nothing but the lack of conviction and concentration of the film. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The final scene, a free male to male rape / torture scene, ran into nothing less than a female revenge rape revenge. However, the film did not even follow this. Instead, the scene pulled out (that FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both to the extent that it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a blow from Dawson's face in an expression of both regrets or "This does not have "Don't fix anything" while the rapist of his rapist is heard continuing in the background. <br /> <br /> My problem with the scene was not a shock, but one of confusion about what was such a scene graphics trying to pass on to the public. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice at Dawson's revenge? a sort of awkward rhythm with more style than substance, the characters are thin, the dialogue is monotonous, etc. <br /> <br /> Normally I try to make films with their words, but Descent just didn't seem to know what they were . Thumb down.
