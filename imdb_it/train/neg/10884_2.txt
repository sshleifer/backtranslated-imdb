In fact, these young people were so disgusting that I couldn't wait for everyone to be massacred, and this includes Clarissa (Joanna Canton) since I considered her the most boring of the group. <br /> <br /> But I knew it would be a disaster from the first few minutes when a young Christine opened fire on the priest and nuns with the music of Leslie Gore playing in the background. He had nowhere else to go. <br /> <br /> Even the prostheses looked fake and the "blood" looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch, although it later assumed a day-glo red look to match the silly Halloween trick. they were all wearing. I'm sure all GOTH deficiencies will appreciate this bullsh-t as that group will like it. I certainly didn't like it. Blah ... <br /> <br /> And neither my beloved favorite horror Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teenage horror movie by herself. It still looks sexy, though. I'm glad you take care of yourself as we don't see too much of her nowadays. <br /> <br /> However, it is a step forward in the meander HORROR (2002) by Dante Tomaselli as it has a fairly consistent plot, so I'll give it a lot. That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer make him go up a lot. I like what Boozer does to Clarissa at the end. It was the only good scene in an otherwise stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Lion's Gate Films definitely had to be desperate when they chose it. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
