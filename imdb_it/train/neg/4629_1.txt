Obviously designed to show the famous 50s stripper Misty Ayers "acting" talents. Too bad I can't act. <br /> <br /> A boring story about the sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then he meets the cute Tommy Cole who immediately falls in love with her. Do you want to help her escape but can? You don't really care. <br /> <br /> There is no real leather here - Ayers just SLOWLY undresses in underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little story full of bad acting, atrocious "comedy" (never thought that prostitution is fun but what do I know?) And terrible post-dubbing dialogue. I admit that in the end I didn't see a turning point that I didn't see coming but it's not enough to make it. Even Ayers' attempts to act are hysterical! A real bomb. To avoid.
