After leaving the popular TV series "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knotts gave the movie star a brave attempt with a series of inane but pleasing matinee vehicles. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", shot cheaply (like most of Knotts' films), is much worse than the others. Don plays a small schnook from the city that is accepted into the astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as their new janitor! Some might say that the weak satire uses the then American fever for the new age of technology, but the film is actually just a dark excuse to keep restless children occupied. Start with a good start, with an OK set up and nostalgic positions, but become increasingly ruthless and idiotic. * from ****
