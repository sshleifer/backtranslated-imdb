Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the film that I found the worst in history. It has been supplanted by this "blockbuster" outside Asia. He has a "star" and is John Rhys Davies. It is very out of shape to be the magic and magical flying jerk that is thrown here. The rest of these people could not act out of a school play. The dialogue did not lack clich√©s and the special effects were phoned as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It's quite easy to see that someone in Asia has some money and needs to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at OR maybe it was a director or a writer who needed a credit. My guess is that any career with this film in its credentials <br /> <br /> Do yourself a great favor and don't watch this movie. Hundred Thanksgiving could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The only funny scene was not intentional. The king's brother appears on the scene. The king? A handsome, older, shorter Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A European of six feet. (Even a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this. They only expected us not to realize that the brother of this poor man, Jet Li, was an aspiring Pierce Brosnan in a cheap "Injun" slimming wig, out of an old 1940s western movie.
