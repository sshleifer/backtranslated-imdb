A documentary maker, like any director, must transmit a compelling story. Pascoe will fail completely in this effort, putting together uninspired fragments of Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The video is shot amateur and video. Pascoe's only effort to combine fragments into a whole is to periodically launch a vague title on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth". <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> Compare this with documentaries like "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War" that create a narrative drawing material from interviews, archive footage and movies. In the end everyone offers a moving and insightful message, cleverly and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming graces of the film are the upheavals of Chomsky's historical dogma and the fact that the execution time is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting passages was Chomsky's account of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating towards dissenting opinions, while the strict liberal dogma of the NPR - covers his interviewees and dramatically limits his authorized messages. Yet another media outlet to be skeptical. <br /> <br /> This documentary is for Noam Chomsky's completists only.
