This suffocating melodrama is easily the worst movie with Ingrid Bergman I've seen. Even his luminous presence on the screen cannot save this unbearably slow and tortuous film that is almost impossible to seduce without making a big turn around. <br /> <br /> Only for Bergman fans; others are very prone to falling asleep. I suggest you look instead at "For whom the bell tolls".
