I turn on 700 clubs once in a while and I only agree with some of the statements made: I am one of the many believers who is considered liberal by most Christians and conservative by most non-Christians. I vote my opinion, and it is usually not a representative. or dem. - I don't think 700 clubs tell people what to believe, but that it represents many old Christians who grew up in very conservative environments. I think many people misunderstand what is said about 700 clubs. annoys me to hear the name he calls in both directions. I think 700 people in the club really love Jesus, but they are so busy trying to get people to vote conservatively that they forgot to show love to certain people and promote peace like Jesus did. Please don't judge Jesus on the basis of ignorant individuals who believe in Him and not be as ignorant with our comments about them. Why are people so bad with each other?
