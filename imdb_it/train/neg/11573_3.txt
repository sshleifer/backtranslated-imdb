I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to place in front of me, and the ones I found made this look a must. How wrong I feel! <br /> <br /> Firstly, it must be said in advance that this is a daytime movie of a housewife. The performances are of wood, each sentence is a "poignant" attempt in the way that the daytime movies and the bad soap operas of the housewife are always, and is based on that predictable and well beaten premise that men (especially the soldiers ) are essentially violent and incompassed. The whole film is about the "drama" at times when male characters threaten to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> If this seems tolerable (or even funny), then keep in mind. Linda Hamilton's German accent, although quite good, is painfully distracting - like her face, for some reason. The other exhibitions are undoubtedly a lasting source of embarrassment for their authors, with the painfully subtle and obvious characterizations that are on the agenda. There are few surprises, but watch out for the endless supply of "Monty Pythonesque" food and drink that miraculously appears from the backpacks of hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I did not expect action, but I had hoped beautiful or material or full of emotions. What I got was a particularly negative story of Christmas "feelgood" that will have an intelligent audience that is raging with the crap of everything. <br /> <br /> Look at it in the following circumstances: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You're a fan of the predictable 'housewife takes men and wins TV movies. 3: The only way to appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You have absorbed enough nog that your emotions are easily aroused by an unsophisticated narrative.
