Here is a small interesting film that gives the phrase "low budget" to a horrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine children creates a strange serum that causes a "molecular reorganization". Students are irreparably killed by false coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. It looks like a resurrection of classic B movies from the 1950s, right? No! It is not an example of high camp fun, which is a lot, WAY off the mark. A fascinating display of breasts and butts follows our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have been 99.44% more in the first place. Barrel entertainment at its best, helped by pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Atrocious films like this would make GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) ultimately catastrophic, the work of an intelligent genius who holds a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F", so relax!
