I saw this movie in a real cinema (probably $ 2.00) with my cousin and my uncle. We were around 11 and 12, I think, and really in the movies of fear. I remember being so happy to see him because my nice uncle allowed us to choose the film (and probably we would never have done it again!) And then disappointed !! Simply boring and not scary. The only thing I can remember that I can remember is Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and it wasn't great, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this has always seemed the worst. This was from what I can remember, one of the most boring, not scary, wastes of our collective $ 6, and a waste of movies. I've read some reviews that say it's worth watching and say "Too much everyone", but I wouldn't worry either. Not even that bad is good.
