It gets really bad. The only quality of half redemption is the effect of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The acting is horrible, save Kirk. The story is as dark as the grail, and the belief that the film is a video game in itself kills the film, if it weren't already a corpse. So all in all it's a waste of your life. I would have given this a zero if it had been an option on the rating scale.
