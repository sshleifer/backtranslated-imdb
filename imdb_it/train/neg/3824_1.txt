I feel that the film has not represented Smith historically. The goal of this film was to tell Smith's life in a way that was "comfortable" for LDS church leaders, historical accuracy seems to have been of little concern. The film was designed to be an experience of "promoting the faith", not a balanced view of Smith "as a man". I took on the task of studying Smith's life and reading both works of the Church and no works of the Church. The film, like most SUG projects, was beautifully filmed and well acted. However, this was not a realistic portrait of the beginnings of Mormonism or Smith's relatively short life. <br /> <br /> A significant period of time was given to reconstruct an incident that Smith had when he was seven. Although this event was undoubtedly important in shaping his mental vision, it seems that the main reason for including it in the film is to help establish a comprehensive view of Joseph Smith. Another point is in portraying Smith's teenage years. The film is silent regarding the Smith family's involvement in magical practices during the 1820s. Another problem is that while the film shows Joseph Smith entering wrestling contention, he can't show how he sometimes lost the be patient and become violent. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever. This film was not historical in any way and should be considered a fictional film about a man. I would not recommend seeing this movie for any other purpose than entertainment.
