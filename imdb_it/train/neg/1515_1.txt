I saw the movie "The Flock" because of the casting of Gere and Danes and why the synopsis of the story seemed interesting. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and I've seen some turkeys). I've never released it before, but this movie was so terrible that I had to do it. I suppose the problems start with the script that was so amateurish as to be incredible. The plot has no meaning and the dialogue is so trivial that it is sickening. Poor Gere, he deserves much better. As for the Gere / Danes on the screen, due to the horrible writing, neither of the two characters is believed for a single minute. I bet Gere wants me to be able to return the negative, if it were possible. It's a shame to see the talent wasted so badly, not to mention I wish I could recover my 2 hours back. (I know what you're thinking, how do I really feel?)
