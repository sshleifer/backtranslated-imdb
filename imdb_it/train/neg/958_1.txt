How did it become a success? Dear God, I don't know where to start because this movie sucked too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the recitation of some characters. The film was too bright, they should have done something with lighting, e.g. make the environment darker. The make-up of certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970s horror movie. This is 2006! People don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make-up. Most horror scenes are made by other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rip-off! This is why I don't watch Tagalog movies. The only reason so many people "screamed" while watching this film is due to compliance. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise them that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, she comes now from the window next door? No matter how you put it, it is STILL A RIP OFF. If you want a good horror movie, go see the 50 best horror movies listed on this site.
