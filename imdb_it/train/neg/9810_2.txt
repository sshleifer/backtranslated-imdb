It is difficult to criticize this film, because I don't like the story itself, and no amount of good acting would have saved it. Think "Raising Arizona" with a bad vein. Acting is acceptable, but Jennifer Tilly is above the lines (but not enough to make this film a good camper film) as usual, coming somewhere between "Misery" and a sarcastic DMV employee. The rest of the cast has their foreheads constantly full of consternation, either from the stress of their parts or from the stress of all the futile exercise. A real degrading a few hours of film. Darryl Hannah spends most of the movie crying too much to be understood. I wish I could tell you how it turned out but I went out, I'm sorry.
