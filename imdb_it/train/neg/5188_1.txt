TV pilots, don't you love them? Quinn Martin tried this out after succeeding in a series of other television investigator films, but this is nowhere going on except in the realm of MST to which he belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find Super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Tree sucks as a villain, despite all his disguises that make him look exactly like him normally. There is more fiber than unnatural clothing here than you could ever imagine (required in the 1970s) and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why didn't he go to the series? You understand, it's pretty brash. Again it's fun for MST, but not much else !!
