The blind bought this movie and I'm rather upset that I paid as much as I did, but I'd say it's worth at least a rent for some fantastic deaths and laughable acting. It's not a good movie in any way, but I have to say I was damned amused. I guess it can be called so-bad-is-good. <br /> <br /> As I said, acting is horrible, I feel like I could have done a better job showing at least one emotion. The story is not new and has been done better. I imagine I have a soft spot for any kind of carnival movie. I would say to rent this or download it but definitely not buy it. It's not worth a watch anymore.
