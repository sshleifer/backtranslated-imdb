I see many movies. I saw the old war games years ago and I loved it. The computers where still "a great mystery" for most of us and the film was convincing, in its own way. <br /> <br /> This, however, seems like a special low-budget Wednesday night. Total crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The plot is so weak, you won't believe it until you see the movie (which I wouldn't recommend in the first place). I can't report an actor who actually did a good job in this movie. But hey, with that script I would have been surprised if someone could do a good job acting. A lot of clich√© scenes. It seems that CGI has been removed from the '86 version. Bah, no, I'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this. DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste it watching bad movies.
