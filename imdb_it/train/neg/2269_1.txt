We make a movie on a talk show that already exists and basically has everything that happens on the show! Well, if that idea doesn't make you curious, which you shouldn't, don't stay at the ringmaster. I had the regret of seeing this in the theater and actually be able to sit in this mess of a movie. I imagine that Jerry Springer does not interpret himself as the economic props show for his show (yes, it seems even cheaper than the real jerry springer show) and is only known as jerry in the film. The plot (if you can call it that) talks about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with her mother alive in a boy. So the brilliant idea of ​​the mother is to call the jerry springer show and to do it even with her daughter's boyfriend. (It's a coincidence that they live in a trailer park). Meanwhile, somewhere in America, a woman finds her traitor with her friend in bed together. So, of course, call the American therapist Jerry Springer! I'll talk about the rest of the film, but even thinking about the movie is giving me a headache. Jamie Pressly, who plays the daughter, seems totally unattractive in the film. And remember Michael Dudikoff, the karate kick ass master of the American ninja series? Well, take a look at him now like a drunk white junk. The fact is that it seems too horrible and out of shape to call him "getting in touch with his character". But if your idea of ​​fun is to see Jerry Springer sing a country song on his show or guys approaching transvestites ... well ... JUST LOOK AT THE FRONT SHOW! ... at least Steve was smart enough to stay out of this movie.
