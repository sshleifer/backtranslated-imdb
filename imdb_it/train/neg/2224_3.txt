I saw it for the first time when I was about 7 years old. I remembered what I thought was a vague outline of what happened. It appears now, 15 years later, that I remembered everything with great precision because it seems that writers have never gone beyond to outline the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no story, character arcs, nothing. Good guys do things because they are good, while bad guys do things just because they are bad. An unwittingly hilarious part is when someone you think was important dies and nobody cares at all. They just shrug their shoulders and move on. There is hardly any dialogue either. If you cut the fight scenes and the current scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watch this because you want to see good animations and for no other reason. Or if you like to watch the hot chicks dressed succinctly (or the dudes branded succinctly).
