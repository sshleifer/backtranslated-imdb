Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with some top notch awards. I'm certainly glad that it bounced from this movie that seems to have its admirers. I'm not one of them. I saw better acting in school plays than I did at Smithereens. The plot is involved in the young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to do it in the music world and is willing to do anything to get there. He even refuses the sincere advances of a young artist who lives outside his East River van played by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> The young Mr. Rijn contributes to the worst performance of the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he hasn't gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good example in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mainly shot. But his work with his live artists was not up to par. I'm not sure he had so much raw material to work with. <br /> <br /> Take a quick look and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth in front of Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street dealer. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you could sit for the soundtrack. I'll stick to Bing Crosby.
