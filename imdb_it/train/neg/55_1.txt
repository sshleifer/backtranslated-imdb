There are only two films I would give a 1/10, this stinker and "The Man who Fell to Earth". I remember seeing Protocol in a theater in the early 1980s when I was in high school. The script is offensive to anyone (including high school students) intelligence. He completely lost me with the "hilly" gag of someone being shot in the ass. Goldie Hawn should be charming but looks like a dull and deficient person. Then there are offensive stereotypes about the Arabs, followed by Goldie who wins over all by making populism drip. The acting was terrible, including that of Goldie Hawn. I couldn't bear to see another movie in which she had been until she redeemed herself in Everyone says I Love You. This is the kind of movie you do if you don't want to commit to writing the script. The worst.
