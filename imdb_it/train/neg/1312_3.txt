Tom is listening to one of those old radio shows, something kids from the 50s to today would watch on TV. However, they did not make television when this cartoon was made so people had their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio. <br /> <br /> Tom is literally shaking his boots while listening to some "ghost" stories. In reality he is literally doing everything the narrator says, like "standing hair, the cold shivers running down his spine, his heart pounding in his throat", etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is looking at Tom and laughing at his ass - the cat antics. <br /> <br /> We therefore have a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194-year comic strip in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, this is one thing, but when he cares about his business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abused, I find it hard to cheer for the "little one". <br /> <br /> These early T&M efforts were also a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that minute makes the difference. He did here as this was actually dragged for a while. It may have been cut to five minutes without losing anything because the splashes lasted too long. This is normal for Tom and Jerry. Usually, they are much faster.
