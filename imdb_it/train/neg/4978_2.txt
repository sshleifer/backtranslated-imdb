This film lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was as if someone had cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I almost expected Beowulf to say exclaim: "I LIKE IT!" <br /> <br /> I saw this because I like Chris Bruno from the TV program "The Dead Zone" and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least kept it coherent throughout the film - unlike any of his costars. They continued to slide into all sorts of speeches from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence. <br /> <br /> There are already many comments on how this film is different from the original material. However, even by itself, the plot of this film is not good. It's just boring, that even the low budget doesn't excuse. Having a low budget means that you need to have at least a good story, a dialogue and a decent acting. Those things don't cost much. Instead, they spent their money on CGI semi-assed and in some decent costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to watch this movie.
