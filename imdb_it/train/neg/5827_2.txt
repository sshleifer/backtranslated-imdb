I do not have the impression of other reviewers that this film stinks because it is ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is not worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis), it stinks because it is a pretentious tosh, the kind of a low-head ride that turns modern art into a bad name. That being said, there are some wonderful images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so there's no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that looks like a cat being gutted, and then, just when you think it is finished, it starts again. I saw it in a porn cinema in Rome that had been hired for the weekend to show Barney's cinematographic works, which is an admirable and intelligent way to reclaim what had once been a local madness of the dirty old men in mac . brigade, but if the trendy youngsters and the slightly older and compliant Bjork fans were to be honest, everyone could have a lot of fun if they had just shown one of the porn!
