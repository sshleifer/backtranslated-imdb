Was this one of the most boring movies I've ever seen ?? I really don't know why? Just your series of stories about the boy who is getting married, and he starts to prefer someone else. The story has been told thousands of times. Nothing new or innovative about it. <br /> <br /> I really don't know what's wrong with this movie. Most of the times when these types of actors / actresses get together to make a film that has already been made millions of times, it's really fun. Usually there are unintelligent things that are not found in anyone else. For some reason, this does not attract your attention. You can choose some fun parts or smart ideas, but for some reason they are not funny at all, nor smart in any way ?? I want to know how to explain it, but I don't ?? Don't waste your time with this?
