Despite the applause on the cover of the DVD of the version I borrowed, this film was a disappointment. Yes, it is much more realistic than other war films of the period to describe the mud, the boredom and the frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately it comes out thinking that it is ALL that is in this film. There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. It's not like a good war movie should have a battle scene every five minutes. One of the best films of the Second World War, "Twelve O'Clock High", has very little action. But it compensates with the crackling dialogue and psychological tension. The exception to "The History of G.I. Joe" is a short segment of battle (entitled "city under siege" on the DVD) which takes place in Italy. Actually it is one of the fastest and most convincing fight scenes of any war movie. But alas, the rest of the film is not worth looking for just this highlight. Another turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro, played by Wally Cassell, who is destined to be a "romeo" but comes out of a pervert. On the contrary, the sergeant. Warnicki is an understanding but imperfect man. As he tells Captain Walker (Mitchum) when he volunteers for another patrol: "Every step forward is a step forward ... towards home". But what last step? a patrol too many ?? guides him over the mental edge. Too bad the rest of the film doesn't do justice to some otherwise beautiful touches. As for Pyle's portrait of Meredith ... he's practically in a coma.
