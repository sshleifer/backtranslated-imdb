As mentioned before, the visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. Personally I use Blender and graphics like those are not easy at all. But this is all this movie. Not only does the plot confuse, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, in the first scene, Proog and Emo are trying to escape from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the bottomless pit room, Proog explains that "a step out of place and (you're dead)". Here, there is a more precise conflict between careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly, there is a conflict between man and man when Proog kills Emo from scratch. Proog immediately changes from being a caring guardian who takes care of a lost child to become a "sick man". He betrays us. Not only is it depressing, but it doesn't interest us because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It is not someone's story, through struggle, emerging stronger. It is depressing and has no point because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world brought to light as it does a great drama. In my opinion, the film is seriously underdeveloped in all respects. However, the graphics are stunning, but a film is more than just a visual treat. There is no truth, no struggle and a nasty surprise ending. In conclusion, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
