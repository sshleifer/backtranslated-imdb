I find it hard to believe that anyone can put this film in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was thin and disturbing, Stigmata was frank, clumsy and too formidable. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in a while, but the images don't make for the downward spiral of condescending performance that makes it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was greatest when it was compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official website increased my interest. The website has had many stories of "real" stigmata throughout history. However, scene by scene, the film is so obsessed with its quest for "genuineness" that it becomes comic at first, so completely hard to look towards the end. I began to become suspicious when the priest in charge of investigating potential miracles enters the beauty salon where our would-be heroine cuts her hair and evidently flirts with the priests. <br /> <br /> The plot: a woman without faith in God begins to receive the wounds of Christ (the stigmata) and is baffled and upset by the ordeal. A priest is sent directly by the Vatican to investigate the case. Is Frankie owned by Satan, or a ship for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this film is that it eventually ends.
