Sometimes I can't understand what filmmakers think when they make a movie ... I had suffered a shock after seeing Welcome (2007) and thought they would never do it again. But after a lot of fantastic promotions, Tashan ended up with a heart attack. <br /> <br /> Three fantastic tracks in promotion - Dil Haara, Chhaliya and Tashan Mein ..... and what do you get in the movie? Zero story, predictable storyline, many acrobatics of Akshay Kumar and nothing interesting besides watching Kareena after her important weight loss ... !!! <br /> <br /> Music is another great disaster ... in the music album, they spent time giving pathetic little dialogues of these 4 jokers and they didn't think of giving the background to the scenes when Akshay Kumar doing stunts ...! that song is so beautiful, comparable to Tashan Mein and not taken in the music album !!! :-( If you're going to watch this movie, I'd say, watch it to hear that background song that goes something like ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Overall very disappointed even with the how Bhaiyyaji made the attempt to speak English badly! <br /> <br /> Go away the man, I need to vomit!
