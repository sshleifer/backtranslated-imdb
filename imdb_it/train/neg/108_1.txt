Pros: Nothing <br /> <br /> Cons: All <br /> <br /> Summary of the plot: a female reporter meets a hitchhiker who tells her stories about the death of people killed by zombies. <Br /> <br /> Review: never in my life have I met a movie like villain The Zombie Chronicles. Filmed on a budget of around $ 20, TZC is a completely horrible horror film based on unpleasant and forgotten actors who could not act to save their lives and blood that is more serious than scary. How is a film like this made? Simply put, avoid TZC as a sexually transmitted disease. <br /> <br /> My last 2 cents: Quite humorously, this film was made by a film company called Brain Damage Films. The brains must have been really damaged to invent a spectacular film like this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (If it was up to me, this movie would get the negative bajillion score)
