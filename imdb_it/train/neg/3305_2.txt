I absolutely can't see what's funny in this movie. Humor seems to be destined for corpses. Is slow. The story is too simple to be true. The characters do not arouse much sympathy, apart from some unimportant characters. Nothing surprising happens. What do the authors of this script think? "Oooo funny! Let's make the old woman in the pot! Let's make them ... chuckles! Let's do them ... behave like children! Oooo, yes, it's absolutely brilliant and original!" <br /> <This film irritated me most of all the movies I've seen in the last five years.
