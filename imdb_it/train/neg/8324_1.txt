First of all, the great actors must need money ... The surgical scenes were ridiculous ... and surely they must know that people who have little knowledge of medicine would find it completely absurd ...... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant ... or perform surgery in a tiny room without tools, heart-lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... couldn't concentrate on the plot because of all the stupid surgery scenes ... no blood, no staff, and then the doc hero who enters and takes over ... it's not a movie for thinking adults .... Even the budget must have been limited ... street scenes were OK but who was the technical consultant ... It seems to have been directed by a total idiot. Save your money and wait for it to come out on DVD and not rent it ..
