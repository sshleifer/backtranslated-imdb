The only reason I didn't get this result is that Sibrel proves to be skilled in the technical aspects of making a film. It's a technically clever film. <br /> <br /> That said, it is a film based on lies and distortions that are easily refuted. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to hit the space program, rather than the real fact. And the "irrefutable proof" of Sibrel that the landings were false is easily refuted if you know something about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend watching this, but if you do, watch it on google videos for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel take advantage of your curiosity.
