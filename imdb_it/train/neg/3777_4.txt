Flat and soulless computer images on less surprising backgrounds animate a horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing surprises you, you can even tell when the voice of Bryan Adams will arrive, which is always at the wrong time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he tells what is happening. Narration is not necessary, however, because everything that happens is really obvious. You can even tell what horses say, even if all they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for pain, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation in the voices of horses. <br /> <br /> Children might like this movie, though. It's kind of cheesy for a family to sit and watch, and there's little danger of anyone getting scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch a movie with your kids, this is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is not recommended.
