This film was terrible. For the whole film I was perplexed and I didn't see any point about it. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was all about. This film is not worth looking at all. Not only is he sick and disgusting but totally STUPID! Please don't look if you're not one of those who like to watch bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society and its values ​​and roles, then this is a country I wouldn't like to visit or worry about knowing. This is a totally sick movie !!!!!!!! I didn't like it because it didn't make sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that's what was listed below. It was a total disappointment.
