I really didn't like this movie ... mainly for the main characters! They are immature, selfish and self-centered people. They hurt ALL those who play in their stupid game. The visual effects were good but what is the use if there are no characters you connect with or a storyline that is interesting. Should I be happy when these two psychopaths FINALLY complete their mutual love? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie I was thinking "This should be France's first success?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> As for the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
