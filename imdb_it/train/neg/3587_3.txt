As can from Joe Don Baker (as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel) to Bo Svenson (as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel). Because they did it for this. Just because Bo Svenon looks more like Bufford Pusser should still not changed because the first sequel was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and the one I wanted to see in the second sequel. <br /> <br /> I would have given this film a 7 out of 10 and I would have given a 1 out of 10 if the story had nothing to do with the life of Bufford Pusser, but it went well and that the reason for which I had given this film 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I strongly suggest that anyone who intends to look at this cheese suggests not to do it and instead look at the first sequel.
