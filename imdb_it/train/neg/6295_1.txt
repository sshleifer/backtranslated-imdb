Suffice it to say that, despite the strange grotesque panegyric to his soi disant "abilities" published here - the director of this inept, hateful tosh hasn't made a film since then. Well, for me it's good news. <br /> <br /> Dead Babies has all the bile of its creator, but lacks the intelligence and technical expertise that make Martin Amis the readable novelist. <Br /> <br /> When will the British film industry wake up and understand that if it wants to regain the status it once had, it should stop producing garbage like this and do something that real people will really want to see? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
