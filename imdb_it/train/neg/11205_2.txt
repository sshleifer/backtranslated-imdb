Yes, well, I certainly regretted having given up my Saturday night watching this strange, but very long film. Apparently not even the main character stole two hours of my life. Here is the epitome of the antiques in "No Regrets". We have this idiot, so messed up, so vagabond, so selfish, aimless and unlikely that it was extremely difficult to overcome the attraction of Jaemin, the promising son of a very favored businessman, unless it was just that: attraction physics. He claims the opposite, which is love. But after seeing this, it's like loving Charles Manson for you to shave your beard. (Okay, it's not so bad, but still no real redeemable feature.) I could never overcome the reason why Jaemin pulled the endless stems off. It has never been shown, just said, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps it is a cultural thing that has crossed my mind: crazy / stalking = crazy love in Seoul. It must be, because a little more than half of the film is one that pursues the other and the last part goes back and forth to the point where I thought it was turning into a dejected comedy. I was waiting for a tiger called "baby" to make an appearance. Ok, so Sumin works twice while going to school, so far he's so good with someone trying to improve himself. But after his first taste of the stalker's attraction, he abandons his day job for a kind of prostitution ring. What? OK, well, as mentioned above, the obsession doesn't stop because of the job / career change and if you introduce other very angry characters you get a messed up movie where incredible events seem to happen without accumulation. Basic film, not 100% terrible, but you can do better with a gay-themed foreign film.
