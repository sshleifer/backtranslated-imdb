This is the worst sequel in the world of cinema. Once again it hasn't done since. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he is killing people who are making a film about what happened in the first movie. Which means it's the stupidest film ever. <br /> <br /> Don't watch it. If you appreciate the one precious hour during this movie, then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person next to you what made them do. Because it does not combine the original forms of horror, action and crime. <br /> <br /> Don't let your kids look at this. Teenager, child or young adult, this film has an impact on people.
