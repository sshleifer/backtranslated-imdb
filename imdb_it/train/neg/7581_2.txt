I saw this movie the other day in a film school class, and I had never seen an Almodovar movie before, but I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a useless film with just a couple of laughs mixed with two hours of pure boredom. High Heels is just a collection of random scenes that may have worked in their separate films, but together they don't add any kind of meaningful whole to everyone. <br /> <br /> Or so I thought. Then, the next day, my film professor spent the entire school period explaining all the little hidden details of the film, such as how the mural depicting flamenco dancers stereotyped against the background of the drag queen scene is a kind of comment on the lack of identity that Spain as a nation developed under fascist rule. Apparently, the whole movie is chock full of clever visual tricks and references like this. <br /> <br /> Great, but you know what? It's still a bad movie. It takes much more than the depth and complexity to make a good movie - you still have to give the public a reason to keep paying attention, something that interests the viewer enough to be interested in all the subtle tricks. The High Heels give us strange off-beat characters but keep them in mostly trivial situations recycled from other movies, and Almodovar doesn't seem to use them to make any kind of point. What is the meaning, for example, of the revelation of the surprise character of Hitchcock that occurs towards the end of the film? Why is he in there too? Just to surprise us? <br /> <br /> There is a fun scene that has to do with a news broadcast. And that's all, it's the only fun time. The rest of the film is just meaningless film references and visual cues that apparently exist only to show us how intelligent Pedro Almodovar is. But no matter what my film professor says, it takes more than a self-indulgent trick for a movie to be good.
