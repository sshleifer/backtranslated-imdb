Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious asshole, his show is terrible. <br /> <br /> Nothing about Lopez has ever been fun. I saw his stand-up and I never said anything like a laugh. <br /> <br /> His things appear vindictive and his animosity towards whites oozes from every single pore of his body. > <br /> I laughed at white people who joke with many comedians and I love many of them. <br /> <br /> This boy has a grudge that will not end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to represent themselves. <br /> <br /> The plots of the shows are always cookie cutters with a Hispanic accent. <br /> <br /> Ride to the movies in the most stupid comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> It could be the reason why this show is always active at 2 am in reply.
