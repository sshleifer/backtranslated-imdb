I was so disappointed with this show. After listening and reading all the hustle and bustle about it, as it was an "exceptional show" and all sorts of wild promises if the quality, I tried to watch it. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment !! The acting was forced and exaggerated. History does not make much sense. As for the reference to "life in adolescents", I could only see a paltry attempt that had the same reality as a reality show. <br /> <br /> Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it's not that good and beating the battery for quality on this show only serves to draw attention to how badly it is done.
