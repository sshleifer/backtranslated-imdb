I saw this movie the other night and I honestly have to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is right, but the plot is totally ridiculous. A killer was born because of all the "energy used to make the film" and if the film is burned will the murderer die? How incredible is it? The characters were nothing short of undeveloped ... for example, suddenly the man says "You're not trying to complete the film because your mother couldn't?" So should we go on with this? We had no idea he was his daughter until the middle of the movie. The film didn't really highlight anyone, we knew nothing about the main surviving people, except that the character of Ringwald was a whining actress, the boy was on set when people died and Raffy wanted to be a director like his mother . Don't really dive in to know who they are. It seemed that things were just rushed to get to the killings. The whole plot is totally too weak for my taste and I was extremely disappointed. Anyone who has enjoyed this piece of shit obviously needs to learn a thing or two about making movies. I can't believe that someone would agree to act or work on this photo. It's not funny, it wasn't scary and it was a clich√© throughout the movie. I found myself predicting what would happen before every scene, which I believe was not at all difficult to do. It is a shame and I am deeply sorry that I spent an hour and a half looking at the chaos. 1/10.
