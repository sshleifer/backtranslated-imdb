I don't think I'm too far from saying that this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I worked on a list of my favorite war movies: "The longest day", "To hell and back", "Bridge on the Kwai River" (all in black and white) all of which have good story lines, rich characters and great acting. I saw better the dialogue and the acting in recitations of a scholastic act written by students. The plot, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's a bit like a car accident, though, I couldn't turn it off! A film does not need large sums or fantastic sets, namely "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is not an excuse. What were they thinking?
