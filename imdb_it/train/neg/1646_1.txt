I like movies about morally corrupt characters, but this was too much. The acting wasn't great, but that wasn't the real problem. The problem was the sinking feeling I had deep in my stomach for about 20 minutes in the film. These characters were empty. They had almost no depth, and what little they had was dedicated to the cruelty that they showed to one another in the guise of friendship. Exploring the darker sides of a series of characters can be fascinating, but you have to give those characters real personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts. These characters were made of cardboard and the image they gave was simply ugly.
