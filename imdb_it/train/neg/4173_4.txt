I must say that when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, kicking ass Vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside .... In space. I mean, I didn't expect a high art, but it seemed like a classic potential from the B movie. This was undoubtedly a television pilot, readjusted some time later in a feature film, after it wasn't picked up. Well, I'll start with a few good points from the movies, the action was responsible for a low budget film, and the CGI and the locations used were passable. Now on the bad, first of all Michael Ironside was the barley in this, and his performance here ... well, it wasn't a good sense. But like I said he didn't do much anyway, so I can't blame him. One thing that was really stupid, was the PETA-like group for Vampires, no I'm not kidding, it's the most stupid thing I've ever seen over time, and it's taken seriously. Moreover, this film commits one of the biggest sins of the movie B, mocks a lesbian scene and does not provide. Especially the one who sinks this film is nothing that really happens. Since he had to be a pilot, the script is almost non-existent and does not have a regular ending. Even the main villains come only towards the end. If ever a movie needed Sleaze and gore factor, it would be Vampire Wars. In closing I will say the main crew on the spaceship, they were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them, and go to bigger and better things. They really had nothing to work with here.
