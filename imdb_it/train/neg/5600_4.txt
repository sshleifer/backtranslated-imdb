fulci experiments with sci fi and fails. usually in his non-horror films we still get a large sum of blood, but not here. Sums very funny scenes like when the lenders are forced to keep a bar for 12 minutes and if they fall they are electrified. the boy falls and has some sort of adaptation on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to resist lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious but not ugly model. and the end explosion is at most ridiculous. And don't let me start the terrible battle scenes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
