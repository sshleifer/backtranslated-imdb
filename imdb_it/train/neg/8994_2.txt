This film is an excellent example of a waste of great resources in a film. The future stars of SNL and SCTV in their best moment, such as John Candy, Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, Al Franken, Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty, essentially make 70 minutes of vulgar, racist and non racist jokes. The concept of a network of the future subversive society may have really been brought to some interesting extremes, but instead right outside the gate, it makes a lame, youthful proctological joke and remains in that vein of humor all the way. much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later, hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie. This film is only for those who want to see a time capsule of the 70s comedy films.
