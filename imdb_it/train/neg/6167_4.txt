Like most people, I was attracted by the purchase of this film because of the images of the mighty Bolo Yeung plastered all over the frame, and the assumption (from the photos and the title of the film) that this film is about the Beast from the East kicks ass for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, to my great disappointment, the Chinese Hercules is for Bolo Yeung which No Retreat No Surrender was for Jean Claude Van Damme and Fearless Tiger had to ... erm, Bolo Yeung - maximum exposure on video box , minimum actual display time! Oh good! <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but it was well made - the peaceful kung fu fighter (played by Chen Hui Min) accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again. Then he runs away to work as a laborer on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy bag-lifting ability, making them suspect he is a formidable fighter (I don't know how it works, but it doesn't matter). Meanwhile, the dock's corrupt boss makes a deal with the gangsters, giving them exclusive use of the dock. As a result, the workers are thrown into their ears and forced to live on the beach, where they unite against their leader, the gangster's leader, and his avid follower Bolo Yeung. <br /> <br /> While the film was quite watchable (mainly waiting for the next taste of Bolo), I had some problems with it - firstly, the bad dubbing, but of course this is a given in the old kung movies it was. But also, the film tended to drag between the various combat scenes. And as for the same fighting scenes, I found them too long, badly choreographed (apparently by Jackie Chan!), Badly filmed and sometimes played by people who didn't seem to have martial arts skills .... in fact, most part of the struggles in this film were not "fights" at all, just people being beaten without offering any resistance! <br /> <br /> Finally, the hero - played by Chen Hui Min. I've never seen any other movie with this guy, but at no time did I cheer for him. Not only did he look small and about to cry at any moment, but I found his insistence on not fighting an angry one! I understood his reasoning, but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done what we all knew he would have done in the end and fight! A bigger mystery was why this whole community of people put their hopes on a boy they never saw fight! <br /> <br /> Actually, the great gratitude of this film was the presence of Bolo Yeung. Not only is she huge and brutal as always, she has great and fun lines and gives the rest of the cast a lesson in how to fight on the film. The boy exudes the presence of the screen and you can easily see how he became a star. The boy scares my life, but I'm sure I wasn't the only person who saw this movie that was cheering for Bolo throughout the final fight! <br /> <br /> So, a below average kung-fu movie has raised several huge notches due to you-know-who. I've never met a person who didn't think Bolo Yeung was fantastic. Man is a legend !!
