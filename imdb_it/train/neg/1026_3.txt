Wow. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors that have played such a crucial role so disbelieving. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only worst actor to play an important role in a film with the power and money of the stars that Edison has had. <br /> <br /> His acting was painful to observe. The story was going well and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine as he had numerous small parts on which to cut teeth. As the director and the film company thought Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to understand it. <br /> <br /> His character spoils the whole experience since every time he is on screen you are rooting for corrupt cops to fill his sorry ass, and it is supposed to be the hero .. I would not waste money on theater or video. MAYBE if you have HBO and NOTHING do anything else at 2pm on a Saturday night and you're drunk and busted, this may be OK. <br /> <br /> Watching Timberlake in this role was like looking at a human "Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood movie, it just didn't work at all.
