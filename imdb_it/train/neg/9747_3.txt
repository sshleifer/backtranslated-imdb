Ok first of all, this movie sucks. But let's examine why. The proposition that a machine is able to transform matter into energy, store it and then transport it and put it back together is at least intriguing. But this is where they take this premise. Instead of investigating what could happen if someone did this kind of machine, they break that damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power and facing constant temptation, that is ... the invisible man. But no ... they break that damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So the doctor regenerates the thing and tries to transport himself. Just for taking him from his beautiful but stupid secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't have happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he's wandering around the countryside killing people because his little experiment failed, and they didn't give him money. Wah. Then, to make the film worse, throw a British report between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Among their loving sessions, they make a couple of unfriendly attempts to find him killing half of London. All this could have been solved without breaking the damn machine, something that would never have happened if Lembach had not left. I tried this movie, so I gave him two honest stars for the effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broken that damn machine, making Lembach go, causing him to try again. Damn you Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
