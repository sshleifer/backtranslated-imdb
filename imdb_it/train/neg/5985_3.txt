This film is just a kid against the evil genre. Thunderbirds is the only way to get people to see it, but they are almost in use. The fact that the action takes place on Tracy Island is just a ploy to attract public attention. It was interesting to see what the directors of the future London will see and how the whole world fits. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film are some of Lady Penelope's lines that are very funny. These provided some relief for those who expected a TV series replica. <br /> <br /> Having said that it takes about 90 minutes in a "fun" way, so it might be worth watching.
