Once a friend asked me to read his script that had been opted for by a film studio. To say that it was one of the most inept and insipid scripts I had ever read would be a bold euphemism. Yet I never told him. Why? Because in a world where films like "While She Was Out" can be lit by greenery and attract an Oscar-winning star like Kim Basinger, a script lacking character, content and common sense doesn't guarantee that it won't sell. <br /> <br /> As many other reviewers have pointed out, "While She Was Out" is a terribly under-written Woman-in-Peril film that abused the Basinger housewife driven by four unlikely caps on Christmas Eve. Every complaint is legitimate, from the weak dialogue and bad acting to the astonishing logical errors, but Basinger is such an interesting actress and the premise is not without promises. Here are a couple of things that struck me: <br /> <br /> 1) I don't care how much we should think that her husband is an idiot, the house is a mess with toys. Since when did you become a pedophile to let children recover by themselves? <br /> <br /> 2) Racially diverse gangs are rare everywhere except Hollywood, where they are usually the only racially on-screen groups. <br /> <br /> 3) Of course, the film is stupid. But so are the countless "thrillers" in which I found myself where women are portrayed as lamenting and helpless victims of male sadism. Stupid or not, I found it refreshing to see a woman get the best out of her torturers. <br /> <br /> 4) I LOVED the finale! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous review coined this phrase, I think this film should be titled "The Red Toolbox of Doom".
