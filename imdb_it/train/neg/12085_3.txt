There's really not much need to start this little review with a synopsis of the plot. I mean, is Shakespeare's Hamlet for heaven's sake ?? probably one of the most famous works ever written. Am I not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet like most people on IMDb ?? through the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to use to judge a movie, in this case I can't imagine trying to watch it without the jokes. In a word, this German version of Hamlet is bleak. 152 minutes? There's no way! It is too dark and depressing to be all I want to spend for almost three hours. I've said it several times, but entertainment is the right thing for me. And this wrist device is anything but fun. Anyway, I'll give him a couple of points for what I thought was pretty good acting. A 3/10 sounds just for me. <br /> <br /> As much as I like the MST3K, their comments do not help make Hamlet more appealing. There are some good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is too touchy to allow comedy to have any kind of rhythm or flow. As much as it pains me, I have to give Hamlet a 1/5 of my MST3K rating scale.
