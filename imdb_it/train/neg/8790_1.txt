I saw it recently on the cable and loved it. I read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half compared to the first half. Personally, I liked the first story (too bad it wasn't extended.) The second story, I thought, was a clich√©. And that "California Dreaming", if I hear it again ... Chungking Express is fine, but it's not something the mainstream public will see, like "Crouching Tiger".
