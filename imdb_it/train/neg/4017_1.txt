Yes, this film receives a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. However, I didn't like this at all. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more suited to a horror movie, she is offered the opportunity to return briefly to earth to live the life of lust she never did before in her worldly life. Scary sex scenes to follow. Because they are disgusting, because they try so hard to be artistic to take away the true sexual act. I mean, we watch porn for sex, no. Little Girls Blue also does things artistically, but it's still very erotic and enjoyable to watch. Obviously the girls in that are very pretty. Here we have an actress rather unattractive protagonist and this does not help things. If you find your role in the adult movie unattractive, there is no artistic vision that can make me enjoy the movie. Sex scenes range from lousy to bizarre ... I mean, there's a snake in one of these people. So for me this film fails because it doesn't excite me at all, but rather turns me off.
