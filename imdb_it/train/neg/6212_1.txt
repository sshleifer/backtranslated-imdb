I used to think that movies require plots or other means to make you worry about the plot or whatever is happening. This film showed me that you really don't have anything like that. <br /> <br /> I could simply summarize it like that. But, IMDb wants it to have more lines. He was cute. not thrilling in the slightest. The way the characters talk in the movie makes you think that it should have taken place within a few days, but there is no passage of time and I'm pretty sure everything happens in an hour. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to have fun, then buy a liter of milk and see how quickly you can drink it before vomiting. It would be a much better use of your time. Time when you will never come back. Jurassic Park 3 has been taken off better than this movie.
