Flick of formula of a boy who wants a girl, a boy who will lie to have a girl next to him, a boy who will get the best friend to help outrageously (comedus reliefus, no?) To deceive the girl, etc. This was done to death, and with rare exceptions of some z-rated releases, it was done better. <br /> <br /> Plot Stand aside, the leads are attractive and there are a couple of good moments. Jonathon Schaech did better, and his acting here came close to the phone call. Not a complete loss, but nothing new here in this lukewarm business.
