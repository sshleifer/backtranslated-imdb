"Bullfighter" was released in 2000 but was released on video five years later for some reason. I wonder why? Could it be: the confusing plot, the incomprehensible dialogue of Oliver Martinez and the annoying editing? It must be. I think the plot was Mary (Michelle Forbes) and Jacque (Oliver Martinez) in a mystical road trip. They meet many extravagant characters and avoid even the evil ones. The film looks fantastic and there is a lot of style, but there is no substance. Most movies, when trying to be subtle, don't draw attention to themselves with unanswered plot developments and weak special effects. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by the cover: Willem Dafoe works there for 2 minutes at most.
