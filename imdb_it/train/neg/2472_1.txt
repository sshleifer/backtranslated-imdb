Anyone who really had the chance to sit in this movie and leave feeling like a good movie doesn't appreciate quality movies. This film was an insult to watch, the direction was the quality of the high school film class and the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate that move with passion! The plot had the potential to be a very intense and very beautiful film, but it fell completely from the first 10 minutes to the rest of the film. Someone said that this film is about a child's imagination, that's fine and okay. But they could still have done better things with this script than they did. I mean, come on, the Indian in the store. Did the child look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says that there is no one but me who works here, so you think it's okay, creepy ghost scenery, but then she only fights for the idol figure and we forget about the kid who see this guy. He was so lame that he goes beyond the pathetic. The ending left you not only wondering what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the sensation of OMG !!! Why the hell did I waste time looking at this !! This is a move that I advise you NOT to watch, there are certainly better quality movies out there that don't insult your intelligence! Thank god I never had to pay to see this movie, I would have asked for my money back! For those who have been easily entertained by this film ... it is very sad that you have lowered your standards to this level of film production to actually say that it was a good movie.
