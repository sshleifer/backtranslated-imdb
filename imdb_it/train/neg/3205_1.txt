I noticed from the comments that most of the people talking about this film are basing their observations on the MST3K airing. This is fair enough (after all, how he got his most extensive exposure), but, having had the misfortune to see "Final Justice" in its original form, I would just like to share some thoughts and comments on the uncut version. <br /> <br /> First of all, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more consistent than the MST3K transmission, mainly due to an exhibition scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I COULD uses the names of the characters instead of the actors , but I just like to write the words "Venantino Venantini"), explaining why the fugitive character of Venantini cannot leave Malta immediately. (It's not a very convincing storyline, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) If this scene was cut only for the time or because it didn't provide much forage for the riffs, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Another point of the missing plot in the original: the betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, apparently unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by a previous, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini violates her shower. While this gives her a reason to turn against him, the whole scenario is really ... icky. (There is no other word for this.) <br /> <br /> Some of the moments worthy of MST (the perpetual cries of "Son of a--" and the sheriff's "deja vu" shootings) were purely the result of the modified TV print they worked with, and they were absent from the original film. <br /> <br /> A scene that I wanted to include in the MST3K version: before entering the bar to interrogate some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese police officer who accompanies him to stay out, because "they see that uniform, not cooperate ". However, Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous cowboy sheriff suit, complete with a shiny badge! I can't imagine why they passed on this great opportunity to make fun of it ... <br /> <br /> One final comment on the original full version of "Final Justice": why, oh why, did they hear the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare bottom on the screen?
