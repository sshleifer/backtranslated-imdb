OMG. This was horrible. It's bad, then there was this. This film makes no sense. It works across the map and it's not clear what it says. It seemed that the music was trying to be like Batman. The fact that "Edison" is not a real city, takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only decent script was "Tilman" in which John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role in a realistic and not exaggerated way. It was really a shame to see John Heard play such a bad character with a lot of time on the screen, and the movie would be a failure. Sin. I hope someone important will see it, and at least give credit to John Heard where the credit is due, and he will take it back as bad, which is where it should be. on the list.
