* review may contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. has a TV movie feeling. The idea of ​​the UN taken by Satan is an interesting turning towards the end of the world according to the Bible. the premise is interesting, but its exemption falls superficially. if you want to convert people to Christianity with a film like this, at least make it quality! I was seriously checking my watch while looking at this piece of dreck. I can't say more about this film since I saw it more than a year ago, and there's really not much more to say about this movie unless ..... skip it!
