his costume drama is misunderstood and without charm. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was a superb character actor. But it is absolutely implausible here as the protagonist, an eighteenth-century thief known for his philosophy and good looks. His costar is, among all the people, Akim Tamiroff. A bit 'of French! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, like the virginal daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis is the best. The film opens with her in silhouette. She is a soubrette and a bad girl at that. Disappears for a while but presents itself in an unlikely situation. But she's good. She was always an attractive actress. Here she is the closest to her usual kind of role. <br /> <br /> It's meant to be a little mean, like ooh-la-la. It should have had a light touch but it's a lead affair from beginning to end.
