It was 9:30 pm last night at my friend's camper and we were so excited to watch South Park (a new episode). The fact is that, in my country, South Park is broadcast at 10:30 pm and we decided to kill time watching the show now on the air, Father of Pride. I'll start by saying that I only looked at the episodes. The first time I saw it, I found it not funny and crude at all, so I thought, "Good heavens, I have a soccer game early tomorrow, so I have to stop watching stupid cartoons." But yesterday I tried to give Father of Pride a second chance. I find it a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, replacing the yellow human characters by lions instead. <br /> <br /> The second thing is that I wonder why he got the TV-14 rating. I find the Simpsons much more vulgar, and the only real vulgarity on this show are some homosexual jokes (little fun). The Simpsons are also much more violent (special Halloween) and crude. I also heard that the creator of the series also directed Shrek 2, well, I have some news for him: Shrek 2 went much better and I think he was too much in the family theme. However, I must admit that Father of Pride made me smile (even burst out laughing once) three or four times. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't care about Padre dell'Orgoglio. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. I saw a lot better from "The Simpsons". <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
