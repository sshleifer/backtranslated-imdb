Ariauna Albright is a very good actress, but the reason she participated in this playful misrepresentation is a mystery. What could have been fun ends with the classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can behave well and look sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs who is fine but it is obvious that she spent the money for the acting school at the spa or the beautician. This was a production that shouted for a T & A and with an imaginative screenwriter could have made it into the flow of things. However Ariauna does what she can, given the circumstances and to some extent saves her reputation. The Tempe company should be aware of the fact that when they dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish rock uniforms the spectators will expect a fetish game and T & A. Nough said.
