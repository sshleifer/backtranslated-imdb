Undeveloped / incredible storyline, (when I realized where it was going, I didn't care any more) ugly casting (come on ... William Macy as a hit man ???) bad direction, (have you ever seen Tracey Ullman play so bad ?) (I had to worry about what happened to the dishonest incompetent, indifferent character of John Ritter?) Bad script ... (Really, I'm not looking for a formula script but this was really terrible) the only really good thing in it was the child. Ten lines? Not good if your comment is less than ten lines? Who are the rules about? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ??? Isn't that kind of arbitrary? Why is it not OK to have less than 10 comment lines?
