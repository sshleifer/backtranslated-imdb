1st seen 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many ridiculous twists. Despite the highly talented cast this film is too predictable and undervalued is the public. The cinema audience is not stupid and I hope you do not continue to fill some pockets of stars again and again despite what they are involved with. We think this film will talk about something with the condemnation of Connery against capital punishment at the beginning, but turns out to be nothing more than a standard, designed for the public, run to the mill, let's never end it, thriller. We are involved in every silly passage in the character, since we are portrayed when it is necessary in the story, and we are ready to let this thing end before it ends. Yes, there is something good here to play, particularly from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psychological support role, but the story does not work from the beginning to the long-awaited conclusion.
