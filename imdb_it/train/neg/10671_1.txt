MST 3000 should make this film. It's the worst acting film I've ever seen. First of all, find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since he left the army in 1993 and pays the rent in cash. There is no way in hell that such a person can ever be so close to a president, let alone a high profile job. Furthermore, the POTHUS security chief would not be so emotional that he would start drinking in a haze if the president was hit. This movie sucked. I can't express the extreme of this film. Every single actor was terrible. Even the girl in the trailer park. I suck at this garbage. What a waste of time.
