This film is mostly chase scenes and special effects. He is very weak on the plot. Most computer chatter was just mumbo-jumbo. I saw it because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie based mainly on computer and real computer terminology. This film had none of this. Most computer scenes were not only impossible and highly unrealistic of real, but simply limping computers and networks. It's like it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was lame and was essentially just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what's the point? The film was boring. Blades sequel.
