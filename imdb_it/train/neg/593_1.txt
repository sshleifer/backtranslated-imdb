This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most repugnant American waste; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in the American slag par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer were taking huge quantities of recreational pharmaceutical products, and when I discussed the plot I thought it was a good idea. it is not. It's a real garbage from the very guts of Satan himself (who probably would have written a better script if he had his head on his head). Robert Jones, as Exce Producer, spending our tax payers' money (people with lottery money) on this nonsense, should be responsible. Who the hell thought it would be a good idea to redo the line of death ??? I ask you: camp like Christmas Tree, Death Line ... "Mind the doors" is the classic ugly British movie, we don't really need a reminder. And we certainly don't need a piece of cheap, second-hand, badly written, poorly developed rubbish like this. All this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> Don't pay NO money to see it. It's an absolute and total shit - the only thing that saves for the producers is that they have a huge slice of money ... our money ... for making them. They should hang their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I am baffled by the low and low standard of this film. It makes me monsignor that our national film support agency actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry as idiots manage the show. Harvey Wienstein where are you? Come back, we'll forgive you !!!
