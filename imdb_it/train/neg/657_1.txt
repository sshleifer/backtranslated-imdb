PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> <br /> with: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis plot: Three years ago, Woman (Brittany Snow) he witnessed the death of his entire family at the hands of his teacher (Jonathan Schaech) who has a crush on her. Now he is preparing for his prom with his stupid annoying friends. Once there, they begin to die one after the other because the killer has escaped from prison and no one has bothered to warn Donna because apparently her dance is too important to interrupt him. <br /> <br /> pros: I got some good laughs from the movie due to the terrible dialog box and the stupid character moves. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely obsessed with her (doesn't look so big) has escaped from prison. Their reason: they don't want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> against: Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of flashes. I usually also enjoy the bad guys. I also like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally rated PG. I also like POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that it's a stupid movie that is classified as PG-13 has nothing to do with me, not enjoying the movie. First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movies that don't even have stories. At least they can be fun. It's about a teacher who falls in love with her student, so she kills her whole family. A few years later, does he try to make up for it by ruining his dance and killing all his friends ...? Then there were subplots which I doubt anyone cared about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is fighting with her boyfriend, she has cramps and I couldn't care less. This should be a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a slasher film with terrible death scenes. I don't even care that it's not so bloody, some of my favorites (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) weren't so bloody, but they still had effective murders. Here, half the characters die in the same hotel room off-screen, a woman is stabbed several times without gunshot wounds and a close-up on the face of a bad actor shouting in agony. I'm sure the 10-year-old girls were terrified, but not me. I also hated the characters. There was Donna Bobby's unrealistically sensitive boyfriend (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee that you'll never meet such a sensitive boy in your life unless you're a gay male. Then we had the annoying friends of Donna, Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the pawn means Chrissy girl (Brianne Davis). If you thought the DEATH PROOF characters were boring, try watching this movie. And don't get me started on Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and the DJ (Jay Phillips) who gave me flashbacks for Usher's performance in SHE'S ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> Add to all those predictable storylines, a terrible soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you get a little smelly.
