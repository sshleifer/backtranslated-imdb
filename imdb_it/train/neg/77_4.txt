I saw this opening weekend in Australia, anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger, Edgerton, Bloom, Watts and Rush that Ned Kelly's definitive story would take place before me. Unfortunately, despite an exceptional performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role, the plot was very thin .... which does not inspire me to read "Our Sunshine". There were more points, Edgerton's support in particular, the direction provided by Jordan (confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers), and the production design that gave a real feeling of hardness for the Australian bush, just like the Irish immigrants of the early nineteenth century must have seen it. But I can't help but feel that another opportunity failed to tell the true story of an Australian folk hero (or was he?) .... in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and the sale of the film in the United States. Oh well, at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please the Universal ... <br /> <br /> Guess, I'll just have to settle for Peter's excellent "Secret History of the Kelly" Carey Banda ". 4/10
