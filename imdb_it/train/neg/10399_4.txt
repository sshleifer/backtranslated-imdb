One of the main flaws of this film is that while mocking pretentious yuppies is satisfying, it fails to understand that filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be mocked. One of the characteristics of these types of yuppies is the alleged misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones who are sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their lunch misunderstandings, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie have the same presumptuous taste in movies as characters do when choosing dinner. If these pompous characters from this movie had a video library in their home, I'd bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.
