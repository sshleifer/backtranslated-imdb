In 2005, George W. Bush began his second term as president of the United States; North Korea has announced the possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a film called Into the Blue appeared. The existence of this film is not as serious as the other things that happened that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. Now, in 2009, the United States has another President, there is another Pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but it is same as saying: "taking your fingers cut is better than cutting your head". This sequel is a really bad film that kept me terribly bored and uninterested. The cast of Into the Blue 2: The Reef is composed of actors from the TV series who completely lack credibility and weight drama, but who are perfect for showing their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias) , Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) carry empty and boring performances. I liked some previous films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bil l and Ted's Excellent Adventure in particular) but in this film he is not able to generate even the slightest level of tension, emotion or entertainment. The characters in this film are not only misinterpreted, but are also repulsive. I wanted them all to die. The film of this film is also lame and seems to have been created by a technical team that produces promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels. In the Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible film that is better than the original film, but it's the same as nothing, as I said earlier. Avoid this lousy movie at all costs.
