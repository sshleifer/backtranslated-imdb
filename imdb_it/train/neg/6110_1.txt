Bo is Jane Parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (Richard Harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in Africa studying something or the other. She follows him (how?) And he tells her stories of the natives of a giant monster whose night howl can be heard throughout the jungle. It turns out to be the Ape Man himself (Miles O'Keeffe, who has the best dialogue in the film), who saves her from the bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them only enough time in this painful two hours to go wild while the horny monkey look and applaud. I'm normally very open to different opinions on any film, but this is the only exception. This is the worst movie ever made. If you disagree, you haven't seen it. (Note: Newsday called it "unbearable", which is the best summary of a single word I can think of. The Maltin Film Guide comments that they almost had to think about a lower rating than BOMB).
