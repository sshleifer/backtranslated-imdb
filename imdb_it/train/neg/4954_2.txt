I grew up watching the animated animated series of Batman and I'm an avid graphic novelist from Batman. With an iconic comic book hero like Batman, there are some traits that can't be changed. Creative freedoms are all good and good, but when the character changes completely, then it is too far away. I purchased one of the "The Batman" seasons in the hope that an extra bonus feature could shed light on the creators' reasoning for making this show such an atrocity. In an interview about the making of "The Batman", one of the artists or writers (I'm not sure which one) said that "we thought we shouldn't play jokes with Batman, but we could have been clever with the bad guys". So, they turned the Joker into a little immature child who demanded attention, the penguin in an anime knockoff, Mr. Freeze in a super-power jewel thief, Poison Ivy in a hippie teenager and countless other shameful acts that are doing Bob Kane rolls his grave. <br /> <br /> To summarize: I would like to have more hands so I can give this show FOUR CHILDREN DOWN. It squeezes from my score with a 2 out of 10 simply because it uses the name Batman. Warner Bros ... look back on this! Please!
