This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. The only most bizarre is its SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour break through a strange nightmare world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a curiously unattractive Casanova and the strange stories of a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer. However, the art direction and the costume designer are EXCEPTIONAL. The Academy did not miss even naming the first, but it did justice rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. Also mentioned (strangely) was the disconnected script, useless and almost inaccessible. Go figure it out !! The film on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes less than the original duration. This spectator was grateful.
