When "My Deja Vu, My Deja Vu" aired last season, I was pleased. Scrubs, I thought, is doing something clever and unique about the concept of a clip show. Instead of repeating the video, they are repeating the jokes in a conscious way, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I found it really unfortunate that I was wrong. One season later, they succumbed to what almost all sitcoms inevitably do, the movie shows ... and it looked like it was created by the guy's work experience. Dr. Cox's shaved head shows how lazy the editors were in putting them together, since he doesn't appear until "My Long Goodbye" about 4 episodes later. I can't imagine a wig being too demanding when it comes to maintaining the continuity of what was once a well-built sitcom. Who knows why he was placed there, he seemed lazy and out of place, reminding me (above all) of episodes that were broadcast over the last year. <br /> <br /> Three second clips jammed together with the background music is an extra DVD for a (very) rainy day, not an episode of prime-time television.
