You get 5 writers together, each of them writes a different story with a different genre, and then you try to make a movie. It's action, it's adventure, it's science fiction, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie is absolutely bad. 4.5 is giving it an incredibly high rating. Having said that, they are films like this that make me think I could write movies and I can barely write.
