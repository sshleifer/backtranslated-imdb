I didn't have high expectations for this movie when I rented it for $ 1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its "killer cut" of "more gore! More sex!" It can't go wrong there! Well ... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How did the actors attract actors and actresses of this caliber for such a low film? <br /> <br /> It all opens with a drunk student coming out of a fraternity or another building like that and saying useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. Then it is chased by a guy in a transparent plastic mask and grabbed by another. They cut her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they "cut" her that someone designed the cuts with what looks like a crayon. <br /> <br /> From there, repeat the same theme as the girl who is chased / killed in a non-brutal way by two boys for about 84 minutes more. Add in a shot to fire. That's Soul Survivors. <br /> <br /> I would not have had any problems with this film if the box did not disfigure me to rent the film. If I rent a bad movie that claims to have more violence and sex ... I want more violence and sex! A complete frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick that is clearly androgynous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. If this is the Killer Cut, what is the theatrical cut?! Of course, I doubt that this garbage was actually put into the cinemas in the first place. Shame on the actors in this film. I could see them making their screen debut here because they didn't do anything before, but they were all established before it was released. I don't know if it was shot before they were all established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. But what I want to know is ... have they really spent $ 14 million on this movie ?!
