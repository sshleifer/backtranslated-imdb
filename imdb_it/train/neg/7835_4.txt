Friend, I really wanted to like these shows. I am starving for some good television and I congratulate TNT for providing these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, I'm in the minority, I imagine, when it comes to the cinematic Stephen King. As brilliant as King's writing, the irony is that it simply doesn't fit the screen, big or small. With few exceptions (very few), the experience of the king cannot be taken up with the same impact that stories have when read. Many people disagree with this, but I am sure that in their heart of hearts they must admit that the best story in the film is just a pale memory of what they read. The reason is simple. The average story of the king takes place in the mental scenario of the characters of the story. It gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. In short, King brings the places of the reader where it is not possible to insert a Panavision video camera. As an audience watching the King movie, there remains less than half of the information the reader has access to. It is not too far off to say that One becomes a character in a story of King reading, while One is limited to the petty voyeurism of that same character when it is filmed. As long as King writes, Hollywood will try to capture everything that comes out of its word processor, with no regard to whether they should or not. I don't blame filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to bring out the elusive Stephen King adaptation that works. The task is similar to turning lead into gold, or some arcane Zen mastery. Oh well, better luck next time.
