One of a multitude of coupons that appeared in the early 1980s, Pranks is noteworthy only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); his character dies soon enough, and the rest of the film is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteer to cancel a condemned university building of its furniture. A crazy killer, however, throws a wrench in the works by methodically exploding the young ones one by one in a variety of gruesome ways. <br /> <br /> Taking advantage of all the clich√©s of a stalk 'n' slash in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow offers a boring and unexciting horror that made me pray for the characters to be killed so that I could keep watching something more useful. Most deaths (which, let's face it, is the reason why we generally look at this type of film) are short and not so bloody; the only truly macabre image comes to an end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivors (there is a particularly cursed and dismembered corpse that the film could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the film is saved from the shame of receiving the lowest possible score from me with a nice unexpectedly unexpected ending, but this is really only one for the slasher filmmakers.
