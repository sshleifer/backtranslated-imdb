I read all the comments on this film. I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama <br /> <br />. As such, I read the book on which this film was based <br /> <br />. The film is a fake and degrading pretense of truth. I don't criticize him for <br /> <br /> modifying small details or events for dramatic purposes; is <br /> <br /> not a documentary. But the script CHANGES the impact, the reaction, the realities <br /> <br /> and the changes in EVERY main character. It extends enormously <br /> <br /> the true relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama. <br /> <br /> From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman (who debases <br /> <br /> Tibetan culture) to Harra's gift of carillon, to the change of <br /> Harrar heart, everything about this movie is fake - except for <br /> <br /> for the extraordinary photo. I understand that the shots of the Potala <br /> palace were taken out of Tibet. However, <br /> <br /> is changing a real story about the relationship between two people, <br /> <br /> one of them very important for this world, in order to build a <br /> <br / > the movie star is sad
