Do you like beautiful girls? Yes me too. What's wrong with saying about beautiful girls / women? Nothing strange, so why should I give this film only 2 out of 5 stars, although it had the "talents" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /> <br /> If I really wanted to watch some beautiful people, I would watch MTV or something. This is still a movie, a so-called action movie. So by definition doesn't it even need a right storyline? I do not agree 100%, but we say yes. So what do you need? 20 minutes of footage from the first part (I could exaggerate a little, but it seemed more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "No". But then again you never know, the people who watched the first part might not know what they ate this morning at breakfast, so hey let's remember ... hey maybe he'll even remember them twice? Just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits arrive, of course !!!! <br /> <br /> So forget the story, the character development, the true emotions, the "acting" (and no, I don't think that women in skirts who walk and / or fight are responsible for acting!) ... what does it leave? Yes, the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and this is why I gave the film 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this film a chance, but it was a waste of time ... You have better things to do / watch, believe me ...
