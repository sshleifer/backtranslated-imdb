I received this film as a gift, I knew it from the cover of the DVD, this film will be bad. After not having looked at it for more than a year, I finally saw it. what a pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I have hardly finished watching this bad movie, but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the full movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie sucks" I'm really shocked that some bad filmmakers have even been funded to make this pathetic movie, but it couldn't have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. all you need is a cheap video camera or a mobile phone camera. About 15 people without acting skills, a script written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the first part of this bad move a journalist (Tara Woodley) runs to suppose that he is a drunk man on his way to report on a hunted city. He is completely unharmed. They went to a house that had to be abandoned, but fortunately for the almost complete furniture and a bottle of liquor on the door step seems to be there. just for the allegedly being drunk, but that's not all it seems. <br /> <br /> Then the alleged drunk begins to tell Tara's ghost / zombie stories. <br /> <br /> The fist of his stupid limping stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> his story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper lets one of his soldiers die due to complete exhaustion (I think this is what happens) after letting poor Wilson soldier he sat down, let him dig a pit and then the soldier would collapse, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> buried him in a shallow grave. <br /> <br /> But the sergeant. Ben Draper has a big surprise. his wife / devil girl knows about this and she and her lover kill the sergeant. Ben Draper to take revenge on private Wilson (near the grave of the soldier he killed). The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombies and kills them to take revenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The ending end was so lame. <br /> <br /> Even if you like B HORROR movies, don't watch this movie
