What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant director, a street blazer ... now he is scraping the bottom ... Is he the same man who directed "The Last Picture Show"? Here, he takes a rather interesting (though unlikely) premise, and turns it into a chewing gum that loses its taste when you take the first bite ... Dunst is not bad, but Izzard is a mixture like Chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been expressed for their "looks", and not because they were right about the part. Sin. I'm going to rent "Paper Moon" again.
