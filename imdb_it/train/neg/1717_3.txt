Here we have 2 misunderstood children who have never had a chance against a cruel and poverty-filled existence: Robin Hoods identified by the police for persecution because sometimes they were a bit wild. Gad! According to this crap, Bonnie was the sweetest thing in the west of Missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic killer by a fun-loving guy who didn't really want to hurt anyone ... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into taking them . Misinterpreted dialogues, poorly filmed, incredible, unrealistic use of weapons, blood that looked more like grape jelly than reality. Avoid this pool of water Thumb down. -5 stars.
