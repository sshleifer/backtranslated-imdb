There are several things wrong with this film - the Brenda Song character is one of them. I don't think the girl is a bad actor, honestly not. I believe she is given poor lines. It should be, "that vain and rich girl", and while it's fun in the TV shows she plays, she can't even have a dry laugh from me here. <br /> <br /> In fact, I should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was not so terrible ... initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you by asking you to wear a medallion and insisting that you had to fight "the great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this film is entirely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in Wendy's family were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks would have agreed. Sure, maybe they could have made it work somehow, but they didn't offer any explanation. In doing so, they simply contributed to the numerous revenge attempts that women's empowerment has produced from Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> Let us not forget, however, that we continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable than the movie. Yes, she's a teenager, and she's coming home - I mean, who wants to fight evil on the way home? The problem is that when "evil" starts to manifest itself, Wendy doesn't seem as scared as it should be. She is extremely distracted, even for someone like her. He still doesn't care about his training. I will take this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you don't win this battle, evil will take over and everything will be fine." Wendy: "Whoa, talk about pressure Well, let's talk about something else". Yes, let's do Wendy. We also go dancing when you should be properly trained. Of course Shen leaves her, but her character has an excuse. Better that he cooperate with her, rather than not him, and she doesn't train at all and gets them both killed. <br /> <br /> Oh, which one of the two. Shen also told Wendy that it was her destiny for him to die for her in battle, as she did for her great-grandmother (I'm assuming that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> As the writer would like, Wendy's homecoming and this "big fight" are exactly on the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you also need to guess? Yes, he ends up going into battle, because when he tries to leave for home, the monks (whom Shen had trapped in the body of his trainer and his teachers because "he felt strange while fighting an old man") inform her that Shen he went into battle alone, so she goes to save him. <br /> <br /> Initially we see semi-decent fights, which are actually fun. Until, in the end, the great evil comes out of rival Wendy's body for the return home, and creates the true embodiment of himself from the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors. <br /> <br /> Don't ask. <br /> <br /> However, Wendy gets all the panic. Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name - and manages to get himself killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy surprises Shen as she makes her long descent to be pushed uncomfortably into the air. <br /> <br /> You scream the title of this article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it's bad enough that Wendy has become very, very fast. No, I won't let him excuse me because it was his "destiny" and she had "the power inside" of her. <br /> <br /> Since when did you learn to heal? No, worse ... since when could it bring people back to life? So Shen is raised from the dead. Then, Wendy and he fight the boy. <br /> <br /> Easily lose the way. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he's banished forever. Then the monks praise Wendy for his sacrifice. <br /> <br /> Two things, n. 1: does the writer and director know that a battle needs a little more "finesse"? 2: what sacrifice? The fact that she didn't go home? Because the girl didn't sweat or bled. I mean, come on now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-hem ... move on. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the film a movie based on my comments. Part of the criticism, you have to know, though, it's ruining something. Do not necessarily try to look for evil, but if it is there, attract attention. This film is very ugly, but something funny happens when you never expect something to be too good in the first place. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose everything was fine. Not that I didn't say it wasn't right would have prevented anyone from watching it.
