I HATE movies of air crashes ... ALL! In fact, I hate them all with a passion! First of all, they look cheap and have no crafts! Secondly, they insult the airline industry and tell the public that all planes do ... OUT OF THE SKY AND CRASH! <br /> <br /> Why does it disgust me in a movie like that? This could happen to any of us and with worse consequences than those suffered by the characters of that movie ... which is the only chilling aspect of a catastrophic yarn of the airline like this one. I hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 movies of stupid airplane chaos before it! Freefall is like all the others: nothing more than boredom before the common shit scenes. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have the same cast of latecomers on this deadly flying trap: the Cleaver-esquire family of three children, the yuppie bauppard and a flight attendant's bitch with a big blonde hairdo of 1987 to blame anyone who is scared in the slightest! <br /> <br /> My second complaint is that this should not be a full-length movie, but a documentary that explains all about Air Canada's "Gimbli Glider" or "Freefall" incident to safety precautions. <br /> <br /> My third and final complaint concerns all the films of airlines of this caliber (with the exception of Fearless) Why the hell did the butler order the passengers to remove their shoes? (I understand high heels and sharp and loose objects, but come on!) Like that will make them even more f # * re safer than they are now! This plane if they (the passengers) didn't know it better: they knew they were about to crash on land. Why should you force 100 injured people to slip on a rubber slide that can cause the skin to peel and bleed on impact just to walk on their sock feet on a debris field! Does it make sense to anyone? <br /> <br /> Fearless and the successful ABC series "Lost" have had more depth and realism in a plane crash than "plane malfunctions": people's panic-stewards become balls - flat lands without wheels in a field - people wandering without shoes and jackets, etc. The same old crap from 1975 airport. Freefall was so typical of an airplane crash movie that I almost expect to see Charlton Heston or Peter Graves break into the damn passenger cabin of We might at least see how these rude characters return to normal instead of people Do they rejoice amid the imminent tragedy that is staring at them? Typical movie of life to life !, cheap and stupid! <br /> <br /> The director of "Freefall" should limit himself to cheap films tailored with white women of middle age with stupid teenage boys who use drugs and have marital problems ... As for the suspense. .. leave it to the professionals ... because we should do the public for over an hour and a half is wannabe rehash airport. I hope they don't make airplanes movies like this anymore. If this were like the ABC series "Lost", then it would be something to look at. But this is shit and then some. Stop turning every catastrophic movie into "Airport 1975"! This is not an "airport", this is a pathetic economic waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie or any movie of TV air disaster for anyone, not even my worst enemies.
