The worst movie on earth. I don't even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing herself with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is similar to a bad sexless porn. The actors are among the worst I've ever seen and couldn't have been worse even if they tried to make a complete tease about this movie. The film must have had a record-breaking paltry budget that I'm sure was almost exclusively wasted on the film's cover. This film has now become a running joke with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other junk movies. I would like to stress that no other film starts to compare. I feel personally responsible for suggesting to a friend and me to watch this movie and I am surprised that you still consider me a friend after the torment that put us through. Don't see this movie!
