This film is yet another in the long series of no-budget, effortless, talent-free movies shot on video and with perfect coverage to fool unsuspecting tenants in the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what to watch this film is like, take a video camera and some red dye for food and film yourself and your friends who roam the neighborhood at night growling and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you have just released "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now let's see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I saw a limited budget, shot on videos that showed the talent of directors and actors or at least effort, but this has neither. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or you are amused by little-made horror movies.
