This film shows that "commercial" cinema, or Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis. There is absolutely no reason why this film should have been produced apart from the fact that someone expected success based on the name of Shaquille. it is worth referring to the plot: it is a bit more perplexing than a knot. What else? The screen is a bit weak, O'Neal is a bad actor, but Francis Capra is even worse. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10.
