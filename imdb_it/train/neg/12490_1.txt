I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 from a video retailer important enough to do "indie" research on the movies since I had just finished my film and was editing it. Sit down with a plate of biscuits and Severed: in a few minutes I feel great !!! <br /> <br /> I hate talking to another director, so I'll only use constructive criticism 1. Find good actors. 2. When you shoot videos, the scenes light up and darken in the computer at a later time. 3. The first ones are better for videos 4. When an actor comes on the scene, wait a while before <br /> <br /> making them talk so that they know what's going on and who's talking 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to open it. Damn worth $ 3.99 <br /> <br /> The True Horror would receive Severed reviews here on IMDb, and you have to give these guys credit ... .
