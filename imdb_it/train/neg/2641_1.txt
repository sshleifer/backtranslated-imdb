Almost all the details of the plot of this film are illogical and implausible. It has no semblance of a genuine, dead and boring human history. It's a Hollywood parody, with musical trumpets reminiscent of a Denzel Washington film, shaky and concentrated chamber shots, racist stereotypes, absolutely useless and comical shots and gestures of famous people in the clothes catalog. It is made to satisfy the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from the vision of celebrity names. The only good thing about the film is the end credits and the funky song that accompanies it. I feel like an idiot for watching this, except yourself.
