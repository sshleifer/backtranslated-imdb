As you can or haven't heard, there isn't a real fight between vampires or zombies in this movie. One might therefore ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it is actually quite appropriate because nothing else in this film made any sense. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things that happened. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than that of dangerous commercials. <br /> <br /> Not only were there no fights between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene with zombies. Their makeup seemed to have been applied by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters who fought the zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding) but they did use chainsaw sound effects. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest film I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance in which I would not totally ridicule every person responsible for the production of this film is if I had known that it was produced entirely by an 11-year-old child. <br /> <br /> Really, even with all the criticism I offer here, I would suggest watching this movie based solely on the fact that it could very well be the worst movie ever, and that's why it's quite comical. Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.
