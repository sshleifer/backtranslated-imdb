1914 was an extraordinary year for Charlie Chaplin. It was his first year in movies and appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these films were not particularly good, they gave him the chance to slowly evolve his character on the screen. However, from this film, the familiar character of "Little Tramp" was still in development. Of course, Charlie played the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency he later developed. Instead, Chaplin often hit, kicked or did other unpleasant things to people for seemingly no reason. <br /> <br /> As for this film, it's interesting to watch the cast. Today they are not familiar, Chaplin is starring alongside Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain - all exceptionally popular stars with Keystone Films. The problem with this film is that while it has some beautiful scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. Chester and Mabel arrived on the track (a very common theme in Keystone productions - it had to be near a track). Charlie and Mack show up and sneak in. Mack is chased by the police for doing it while Charlie slaps Chester and steals his girlfriend. In the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take Chester and Mack away - leaving Charlie with Mabel (who, strangely, didn't seem discouraged by Charlie's crude behavior). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a great comedian or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is important only in the evolution of Chaplin. What he and the other actors do on stage, though not unusual for a Keystone movie, isn't particularly funny when viewed today.
