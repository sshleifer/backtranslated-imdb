Unfortunately, this film makes no credit to the original. Nicholas Cage, rather wooden with regard to the actors, fills the screen with a range of skills to, not plussed to over the top. The supporting cast is no better. <br /> <br /> The plot remains very similar to the original in terms of scene progression, but it is much worse. Not enough details are provided to allow the public to enter what is sold. It turns out that it's just an account of poor goods. Unbelief cannot be suspended, nor can a doubt be given. The only saving aspect of this film is that it is highly visual, as the medium requires, and those who have explored the location should be praised. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and more boos, literally, at the end. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on TV, pour a whiskey and have fun.
