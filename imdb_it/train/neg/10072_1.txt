Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros at the cinema to watch this shallow movie without meaning. My points; <br /> <br /> The film is based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic point of view: as in most American films, the writer considers himself an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately it's not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 other food names does not make a person understand a culture. For example, shaving is the sign of clean life in Asia, but everyone was trying to stop the girl. The Lebanese are Christians (Ok they understood) and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other Arab countries. The main difference between oriental and western culture is that we don't do ethnocentrism. So let's not judge people after their first question about our life as the paternal figure did throughout the film. <br /> <br /> 2) A girl's sexual revolution: there is not much to say about this. Show me 10 girls who have had these on their sexual awakening than I will say I am wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the genre of black humor. Please look at Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor must reflect the truth and must focus the audience on the fun parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the film.
