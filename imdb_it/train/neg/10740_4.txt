This film begins with a certain amount of promises; but, in my view, he begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-intentioned stranger starts to repair his car while he's away, making a phone call is quite unlikely, but he's one of the few people in the country who can help him get his family back on track is the kind of coincidence that starts writers are warned not to use in their stories. <br /> <br /> I found this film at maximum average. The art direction could have been much better, as the cinematography could have been. The acting was good, as was the song of Eva van der Gucht.
