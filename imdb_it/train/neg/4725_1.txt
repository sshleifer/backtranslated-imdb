A great opportunity for Indy and the director to make an interesting film about a celebrity rock musician. It could have been a decent film if he had faced John Livien's traumatic past and how he tortured his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify the life of John Livien with John Lennon. The hero of John Livien's suicidal mother was John Lennon and he wanted her to become as powerful and prolific as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on the musical genius of John Lennon and his wonderful ability to discover himself for others to learn something about his life, he showed that Lennon's legacy was that of a drugged and drugged soul, which should be considered a God instead a man. I'm a big John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Should we remember that? John Lennon has given so much to the world with his music and honesty and I have been rejected in seeing another disturbed person, like the protagonist of this film obsessed with Lennon, and not showing his beautiful contributions to the world. Yoko Ono has graciously honored the memory of John Lennon, making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans the chance to pay tribute and remember John. Instead the director of this film chose to use that site to make the killer try to commit suicide. I found it so disturbing and disrespectful of Lennon's memory. He was a man of peace who died of a brutal senseless death and to see such violence near this site seemed a revisitation of a terrible wound for every Lennon fan. It completely ruined the film for me. It may have been a decent movie, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not remember his perverse murder by this irresponsible film.
