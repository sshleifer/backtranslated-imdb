As a complement to Hammer I feared the time when I would have the courage to watch this film and what followed, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen the movie One the Buses and I considered it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was full of all the terrible comedy that plagued British TV screens in the early 1970s. I am ashamed to say that in reality there were parts of this film that I laughed about. I don't know if it was because by now I knew the characters and I enjoyed some situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly amusing, even if I could swear at any point in the trilogy, his torment says, "I'll take you Butler." <br /> <br /> After watching Holiday on the Buses the jokes were starting to get thinner and these three films could be compared to a Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, as the second film made is the best (though this is probably the only way they could be compared). <br /> <br /> only people who would like to see this movie are probably fans of the TV series, who will no doubt appreciate this, and Hammer complete like me. For the completists I would say that this film is not so bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies.
