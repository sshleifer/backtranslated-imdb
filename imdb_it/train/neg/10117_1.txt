Wow. I went to the video store tonight because I was in the mood for a bad B Horror movie and I found this gem. I looked at the cover and thought it was just the film for my mood. I brought it home and wore it. <br /> <br /> This movie was not the B Horror movie I had in mind. This was VERY worse. I wanted a bad movie but what I got, I didn't know that crap had existed between the man. This film looked like a 5-year-old child, he wrote and directed it and this is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I am an aspiring director and this film has made me so angry that someone out there is paying him direct films. He needs to work in a dump that shovels shit to which he belongs. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting this or buying it. I'll tell you the same thing I'd say to someone who is preparing to commit suicide. "DON'T DO IT, DON'T WORTH IT!" I really don't have anything nice to say about this movie. DO NOT DO IT!
