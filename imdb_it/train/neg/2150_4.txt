You will immediately recognize the plot. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to reunite mom and dad. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the ghostly thing. Although Deanna Durbin was younger than twenty-one Hayley Mills while playing the role of the nurturing, Durbin looks much older, as in adults. And so do all his so-called brothers. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child runs throughout the film. The girls are dressed in pretty sailor suits but look ridiculous as the director seems to care about highlighting their large tops and tushies throughout the film. So you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and the others start to "beat" them, you have the feeling of being pedophiles, and you could be one of them even to notice those guys and the tops that the director was pointing out. You guys or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you're never quite sure what you'll think of them. <br /> <br /> Even the parents seem very old and the whole movie looks very dated. <br /> <br /> It's a rusty version of Parent Trap and you should avoid it, or at least make sure your tetanus shots are up to date if you don't believe me.
