If you watch this movie, you are a fan of Fred Olen Ray, you found it on the shelf of $ 4.99 at Suncoast and you thought "what should I lose?" Or you shot the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first film touched with your fingers. <br /> <br /> This film is hysterically bad. It has everything a terrible film needs: a script with stunning dialogues and deviations in the plot, an extravagant science that involves psychics and other dimensions, a continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space, actors that are not just about wood, but seems to touch on confusion, free nudity (not all that it would necessarily ask), and, of course, a 5 'monster played by what I assume is the son of Fred Olen Ray. <br /> <br /> All this, however, there is something similar to the heart - as if Mickey and Judy decided to reunite all the neighborhood children and make a monster movie (hey! my father can direct it! yes , we can use red paint from my johnny dad hardware store, and I know this ex-stripper who can act in it!). <br /> <br /> Watch the blooper reel beyond the end credits - you have to find out why the final cut of the movie was so lousy. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, Biohazard II ... is also worth the alien strength, but don't have the same pleasantly disgusting veneer this does.
