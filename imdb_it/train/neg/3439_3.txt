***** probably minor spoilers ****** <br /> <br /> I can't say I liked it, but I can't say I didn't have it ... it's very strange. There are bad things in it such as a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were the director I would have cut that part for sure, it gave me the impulse to stop seeing the rest movie. .. For some people it will be boring because it doesn't work, you feel at home sometimes ... Let's take for example a scene where one of the friends died and the next thing they are doing is what? nop, don't cry ... their horror stories that tell each other .. * sighs * (just after crying for losing) <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had "hundreds" of candles on the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by some sort of rag curtains (old rags covering the windows) and sofas / sofas ... I thought that were stupid, using candles but not thinking about the surroundings, besides being alone on the high seas ... <br /> <br /> Good scenes, some scary ones are well done I liked some. Sometimes horror works best when it's hidden when it's behind something instead of showing, so this movie is good, maybe because it's a low budget I don't know, but it works fine for me! You will feel tension if you forget holes like the ones I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much! but if you like cinema look at this, be patient, try to have fun .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry for my raw English) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
