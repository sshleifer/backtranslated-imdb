I remember when this piece of rubbish came out, all the newspapers were shouting about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to make the film. Well, it wouldn't have taken many years; the game was only opened in 1975, eight years earlier. He made a Broadway star the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably should have been chosen for the film, but NOOOOO ... the BIG STAR BARBRA HAD MADE ITS WAY. AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a total disaster from beginning to end. First, Barbra was 40 when she made it and looked at it every minute. There was no way anyone could swallow her like a girl who wants to study the Torah. And then when he dresses as a boy he becomes campy. I have the impression that Streisand can't stand not being attractive, so he played with makeup; she's prettier than a girl. And as if he weren't ugly enough, he gets involved both with his classmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is the blow of his naked back) and his girlfriend (Amy Irving, who does her usual routine from somnambulist, a bit of a schtick, the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she doesn't know what she's doing). Yentl even marries the girl; I won't even bother to mention the "wedding night" scene. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. Nine totally forgettable songs, all sung by Streisand through the voiceover (presumably like a look in his mind), and each as intrusive and irritating as nails on a blackboard. <br /> <br /> I won't say that Streisand doesn't show a glimpse of promises as a director here; some of the images are adorable (especially Patinkin's bottom), and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this film is that it won't come out of its way. I didn't believe her for a second in the title role; he should never have added the songs, and what's more, the whole casino went on for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of all the unpleasant mess after forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> Horrible, horrible, terrible.
