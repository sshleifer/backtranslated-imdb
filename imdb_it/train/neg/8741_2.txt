Five minutes in this film you realize you've seen it all before. It is the CHAMBER OF THE BOILER. IT IS THE COMPANY. And it is the lawyer of DEVILS. And there are no new elements here. Except for the all-allegory Bill Gates-allegory. Beliefs are always good things for cinema, but why does it have to be so extreme? The boiler room is a good movie, because, at least for a while, it looks realistic. In Antitrust it's all wrong. How realistic, for example, is your boss paying an impostor to be your girlfriend to get you to work harder and control yourself? I would give 1, but the soundtrack is OK, then 2/10.
