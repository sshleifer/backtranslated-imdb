I found this film in the "horror" section of my video store. This seems to make sense given that most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's trilogy "dead" to "28 days later". However, by looking at it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> Actually it is a music video that becomes progressively faster and becomes increasingly bloody. There is no horror here folks. Only a few decently staged action scenes that soon become tiring because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling that maybe you're a DVD player jumped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how the film did it. It's a shame. I think anyone could find a better use of $ 7 million in the film industry than to make this lump of rawness. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were fantastic, but again, they were too used and they became boring as it was always the same acrobatics, always with a different character. <br /> <br /> annoying ROYALLY is the splicing of the arcade game movie. I played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it here? Oh, right, this is not a movie but a music video, and it's a poor movie. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: a lot of violence / blood and swear words
