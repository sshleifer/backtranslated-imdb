Hold on, because they couldn't wear Black Chicks, oh yes, they wouldn't have been different at all. Can anyone give me a Wayans movie where they didn't wear ladies? Do not Be A Menace does not count, Jack White and Michael Costanza wrote this ghost (the other members of the Norton Trio made the director). <br /> <br /> In White Chicks, there are never any lines. It's only the Wayans who act like girls for 2 hours. There are no configurations, no jokes and no laughter. There's a lot of "I think I'll play Time Crisis 3." At least for me there was (5 times to be precise). <br /> <br /> Someone has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talent), Kim, Rakeesha, George W. and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making films. It only hurts the O-Zone layer. <br /> <br /> VERDICT 1/2 * on ****
