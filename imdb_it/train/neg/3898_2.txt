I'm terribly sorry, I know that Fa√übinder is still defined as one of the greatest directors of post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004, I wonder what they all are in this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all smiling like an idiot! - The changes between Nazi glamor and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks like it was made within two days in an attic. It was probably exactly like that and many people seem to take this for "real art", but for me this film is simply bad and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "The Fall of the Gods" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
