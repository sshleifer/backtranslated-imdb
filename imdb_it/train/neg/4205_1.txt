THE ALARMIST is so abysmally scripted that you thought of yourself because an emerging actor like David Arquette never agreed to be there. It must be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without any humor, bordering on boring. He starts a terrible conclusion that seems to happen only because the director is bored and just wants to quickly conclude to go home for dinner. Stay away!.
