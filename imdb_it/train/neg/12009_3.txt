I had a video of it. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole movie without falling asleep. It's a slow movement, and the idea of ​​a center-Atlantic platform, which at the time could have been revolutionary, is now just a big and big joke. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast is rather forgettable, and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. When the water started to pour in, even on one occasion it woke me up. <br /> <br /> But give to whom it is due. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He does not wedge it between his index and middle fingers like minor mortals. He holds it between his fingers, showing us the old pearly browns. There are some scenes in this film where the smoke heads towards the sky against a dark background and looks very artistic. But it doesn't say much about this film if all you get is tobacco smoke.
