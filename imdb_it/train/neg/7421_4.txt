Watching beautiful women who sneak in, playing guards and thieves is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures that the average movie makes me enjoy. So The House on Carroll Street was not just a waste of time, even if the story is artificial and the script is uninspired and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to different images of Hitchcock, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the title role. She is dressed as Grace Kelly and is not far from the brand. Not at all. But his character is not convincing. The way it is presented to the public, you should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. After all, the film deals with a clearly defined period of time, real events and a specific problem. But the story degenerates within the first few minutes into a sad, deadlocked criminal story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a set of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable, since the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the setting. <br /> <br /> The finale of Central Station, New York, is breathtaking. Start in the underground section and then go up to the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of architecture.
