Now look, I won't lie to you, but I got this movie for $ 3.99 from a friend because he had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever-popular death metal band "Cradle Of Filth". Obviously I expected violence and blood at its best, because that is what Mr. Filth can be portrayed as, between one plot and another. <br /> <br /> But my dear God, I was so wrong. This movie seriously bites, big time. Being a low-cost film (haha, wait, create this ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the wonderful orchestral scores by Howard Stern and Spielberg's special effects. No, it's a whole camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. <br /> <br /> Take for example when our violent star, Mr. Filth, violently kills a robber. A grab to the throat, and the blood spits, but oh my God, there seems to be a packet of juice full of fake blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> To you Cradle Of Filth fans: You will hear two songs throughout the film, but with the camera's corners and shoddy footage, they drag the overall pleasure of the DOWN song. <br /> <br /> My final comment: steer well away from it. It's blood, cold blood, breast and hey, even a poor story. So if you like terrifying violence, almost no voice (yes, there is almost no word in this film), then by all means, buy it. But if bad movies aren't your thing, then avoid it. Don't waste your money.
