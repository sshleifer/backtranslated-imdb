I saw this movie the other night. I can't even express how this movie was sucked. Writing, vocal acting, even claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the taste of comedy. It just doesn't work. It literally falls flat on every possible point. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the animation of the film is of very poor quality. I know this is a one-person movie, but to think it could do 97 minutes of shit, maybe it could at least make 1 second of fun. <br /> <br /> This show could take the cake to be the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It was really that bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, avoid this abomination. My advice: don't even buy it, or look for it. Your brain will be more than you.
