Looking at CBS's "Surrender, Dorothy", I kept wondering why Diane Keaton would have liked to be in it (not because it was a TV movie - with the scarcity of enticing roles for somewhat older actresses, no wonder for which Academy Award-winning artists like Keaton are turning to TV - but because it doesn't offer Keaton any opportunity to shine). A single mother, mourning the sudden death of her 20-year-old daughter, imposes herself - and gradually becomes a friend - to the group of young people whose daughter was near the time of the accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that can be crossed to avoid the road. In addition to being coarse and dark, these fake people are incredibly unconvincing, like the tidy scenery and the bungalow near the beach where the children reside (a young man, wearing muscle shirts to tell us he is gay, listens to Diane Keaton saying "Give up , Dorothy "and actually asks" This is from "The Wizard of Oz", right? "... no, genius, it's from" Citizen Kane "!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the subject of facing death. He tries to turn this clearly unpredictable woman into a shadow of his own character (a lot of kooky clothes), but he doesn't fit the viewer well as Keaton has always been pleasantly sympathetic and flexible in an unbalanced way. Here, it is a crazed harpy who does not learn many lessons about her journey of self-discovery (the film quickly forgets she is a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for a mother's nervous wreck, which seems to be an exaggerated hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). This is the kind of movie actors who promote on talk shows with the warning: "It should help many grieving mothers out there". I cannot imagine that it can help someone since it is inherently a negative, confused and disconcerting aspect. It's unbalanced.
