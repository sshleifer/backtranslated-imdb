Yes, I know that the "talkies" had just been invented for the cinema two years before, when it was produced in 1929, but this film showed that it was necessary to know the art of film production. It is a theatrical game "hammy" shot with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines, rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more suited to silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on the screen. The spaces between the pronounced lines should have been tightened during editing because it slows down the film considerably. Now it's only interesting for Titanic fans who want to see a first example of this marine accident on the film. In the next chronological order they could see "Titanic" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958) "Titanic (1997), to see how the representation of the cinema of this tragedy has evolved over the years. Many documentaries and films have been made TV including the atrocious "SOS Titanic" (1979). On which is a DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction. It was he who played Harold Bride's young wireless operator Marconi in "A Night to Remember" (again best feature film - read my comments "Tribute to Walter" on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk) and commented on the series of 4 videos entitled "End of a Dream", so he was well qualified to give the narrative Of more interest I found a recording accompanied by real photos of 1912 The hearing in the United States Senate, which is also on the DVD. The actors speak the words spoken by Lightoller's second officer, J Bruce Ismay, White Star CEO , Harold Bride e others including Gloria Stewart (The "Old Rose" in Titanic 1997) whose voice is used for one of the first-class surviving women.
