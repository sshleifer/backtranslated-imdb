My God. oh my god, I can't pass this movie. It was terrible. horrible terrible! Don't waste your money to buy it in the 99 cent bid. No, avoid it at all costs I'm warning you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Get what looks like some new Barbie doll .. Super women? Are you kidding me. It was so fake fake fake. The people of the city didn't even seem to care that there was a flying blonde flying around the city to save a fire .. Ohh great! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did I make the film look offensive ?? I guess what you need to be a superhero is a pair of double D's, flowing blond hair, no glasses and a tight-fitting leather dress ?! <br /> <br /> If you tried to be romantic ... of ... God, I don't know. It was horrible, if love means bringing someone to an art show and then having sex in a bed AND in the air ... to have total love! <br /> <br /> He was pathetic, everything was going too fast. First that guy was single, rather than going out with G-girl ... who left behind him that he dated that Hannah girl ... and ... keep it up. <br /> <br /> I must say that this film made me wonder ... How the hell did they get this in the movies? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
