Twenty years ago, five-year-old Michael Hawthorne saw his father kill his mother with an ax on a deserted street and commit suicide later. Nowadays, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldives ( Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the countryside with his grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that represent their greatest inner fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they will perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty (Jon Fedele) which would eliminate their fears forever. Michael's biggest fear is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father, killing his friends. <br /> <br /> "The Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and useless film that uses the interesting concept of eliminating every friend's greatest inner fear before it grows, but in a messy script full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation as to why the mannequin is brought to life; moreover, despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or pain when each of them dies. The low rhythm over fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a fascination that his father was interested in not having noticed throughout history. I don't know if the previous reference was modified in the DVD published in Brazil with 87 minutes of duration. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night of Halloween")
