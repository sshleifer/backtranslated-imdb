This is a rather boring film about a scientist who creates a teleportation device and becomes horribly disfigured when he uses the transport machine. Simple texture made first on the fly and others. Not only is it disfigured, but it can also electrocute people with a touch. What is really stupid about this movie is that it is expected that we believe the place this guy works is against him. He could probably make millions for the institution where he works, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter at every stage of the process. In the end, the projected man electrifies three people for no reason, then pursues those who have wronged him.
