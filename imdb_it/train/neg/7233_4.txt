I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only one seeing this fake movie. I looked at it three times, once with comments, and found myself bothered by all the close-ups, whenever the screen went blank and, worse, I feel that the film never solves anything. Yes, the priest dies, but he didn't really seem at peace with the city that gave him so much pain, or with himself. That and he was an idiot. If it hadn't been for Peter Cowie's comment that explained not only the film but the book it came from, I wouldn't have been able to stand it at all. I like French films, but this is absolutely absurd. <br /> <br /> The diary of a country priest is shot in a beautiful black and white photograph but, alone, he cannot save this deadly opaque triad. Scenes after scene of extreme close-ups in which the characters do not say anything until the camera retires and does not switch to a black out DO NOT create an interesting or relevant story. The way this film has become a classic is shocking: it reminds me more of The Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> Yes, Claude Laydu's performance is felt and stimulated, if you are a sadist, but this film came out I feel empty because on the whole it is a weak impression of the Catholic priesthood, which is a ignoble and inglorious institution of corruption. The triumph of the young priest over the countess's pride is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will drag you down with its dark introspection and the window in the melancholy thoughts of the young priest. This priest does not present himself as humble as simply pitiful. <br /> <br /> Being that I don't speak or understand French, I couldn't wait to do the English SUBTITLE to help understand the film. Well, the English subtitle is sometimes impossible to see / read and the text flows so fast that there was a lot I couldn't read (and I'm not a particularly slow reader - I just finished Dostoevsky in 3 days). <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie. I try everything that is "chosen" by the Criterion Collection, and yet I cannot understand why in many ways this deserves some critical mention. However, I sat through this whole two-hour movie wishing to feel some sort of empathy for the main character, and it never materialized. He seemed only a victim rather than a fighter. And for that, I say it smelly.
