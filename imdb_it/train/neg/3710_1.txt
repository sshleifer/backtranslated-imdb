The king died long life to the king! The triad of Caddy Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs and Troop Beverly Hills had been linked for the worst film ever, so much so that they looked like icons in their own right. But there is a new king ..... yes ..... all greet the new king .... "Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so bad that they are good. One day this could bring out the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult film. So go see this .... this .... well, take my word for it. Go see it. Everyone greets the new king!
