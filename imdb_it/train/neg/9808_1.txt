Worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have superpowers, and when they use a special device, they turn into strange, poorly designed clothes. Acting when I'm not in late-looking suits is decent. Definitely not good, but it's not the worst acting I've ever seen. However, wearing their clothes, the acting of the actors goes from bad to worse; much, much worse. Hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary movements that they do. Even when they talk they seem to have attacks. Bad guys are dumber than Rangers. Every episode, some weak, idiotic thug comes with a plan to destroy the Rangers. Then send a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transformation animations, then destroy the aliens. Thus, the ill-designed villain, who may be either a armored rascal who actually looks and acts badly, a humanoid creature like a ladybug with trumpets attached to his back showing obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the evil one, then the evil one turns into Godzilla, whether it's a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they shoot the bombs at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes reciting hyper-animated and summoning their Zords, which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used to make special effects special. The Power Rangers win, the bad guy gets angry, everyone teaches a "precious" lesson and the show ends. That's all. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, false kung fu fighting.
