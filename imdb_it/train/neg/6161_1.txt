This is probably the worst fencing, sword fighting, film ever made. This is not just because the so-called sports fencing is scarce, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to immerse themselves in a semi-naked sex scene and, later, supposed groups dancing around a fencing scene in the club of fencing, I suppose to keep the public interest. What a waste of talents of F. Murray Abraham. It will serve you best with exaggerated and bold films like Zorro, Scaramouche, everything that targets Basil Rathbone. As a fencer I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport in a film, but if it ever happens it is necessary to have fresher, better designed characters and a deeper storyline.
