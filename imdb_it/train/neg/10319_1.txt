Unlike many, I don't find the premise or theme of this show in any way offensive. However, its execution is completely different. Like so many B-minus movies, it looks like all the decent gags have been stuck in the trailers. For most of the 22 minutes or so we sit waiting to catch every bite of real humor. Or at least something to prevent its restlessness with the remote control or the counting of the fibers of the carpet. With a couple of exceptions, acting is horrible; the comic over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be suitable for a late-night commercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even Canadian.) Despite the certainly original cultural angle, I can't help but think that this is mainly a shot fired by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone and screenplay completely wrong for the grasslands. The final insult is that apparently they couldn't even afford to do the work on the location in a small real town (why? Are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the public would be deceived by the exterior of Regina's center? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing will soon disappear, and that the rest of the world, triggered by CBC publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
