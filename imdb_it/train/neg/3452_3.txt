I opted to watch the film at the recent Dubai Film Festival because it was selected in the prestigious Competition section of the Cannes film festival. I was surprised that Cannes could be so out of place in judging quality. <br /> <br /> The film, some reviewers, have noticed that it does not have too much firearm, but the inherent violence is repulsive. Imagine killing your enemy / competitor in front of your little son ... or forcing someone to eat a porcelain spoon to prove loyalty. There are some references to the contrasting Corleone children in Copolla's "Godfather" who seem to resurface here in this Chinese / Hong Kong film but the quality of the two is distinctly different from chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> This film is recommended only for violence addicts ... there is no big cinema here. At best, it could be considered better than the normal production of Run Run Shaw for production values.
