I do not give much credit to the conspiracy theories of AIDS, but it is sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon being dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the scared and the dying often generated dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demasoide of San Francisco. The city, renowned for its beauty, rarely appeared more ugly than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene. <br /> <br /> Although the acting and the plot cannot be said to be well done, the films, a unique cultural context and an overwhelmingly dark mood, at least in part, save the film from being a complete loss. In fact, I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a Jewish, lesbian police detective (?) Crunchy and cynical. It's interesting, though not necessarily convincing. <br /> <br /> Highlights: the cinematic use of the tragic and tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime and silent cameo by the iconic performative artist, Ron Athey.
