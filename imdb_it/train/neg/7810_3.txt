Against All Hope is a very badly done film, sometimes painful. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and show, he's not that good. Some people may find the story laughable; an alcoholic realizes that his life and his family are falling apart and therefore calls a preacher as a last resort to ask for help. After telling the preacher his story, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> Actually I found many religious scenes, like when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church, but walks away from it, quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows that his life is falling apart and trying to get help, but he realizes that only God can help him. In the end he realizes with the help of God that he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This film is not well done. The acting is bad, the script could use some work and it looks worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Now, just because you become a Christian does not mean that you will automatically be able to stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to stay on track. Overall, if you are a Christian, you will appreciate how this film portrays Christianity and if you are not, you may find yourself called to find out more about faith.
