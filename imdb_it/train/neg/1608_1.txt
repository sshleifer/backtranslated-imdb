The charisma and appearance of Che have to do as much with its iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda (like this film) about him. <br /> <br /> I don't know what's worse: being captured by one of Che's assassination squads or sitting in this typical Soderberghian junk for 4 hours. The question is not why this pet project was implemented, but what took them so long. By "them" I refer, of course, to Hollywood on the left and its "secret" love for Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... choose your choice). I am fascinated by the fact that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's less talented liberal directors to finally embark on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand too? It's a mistery. All these overvalued "artists" have often given themselves in similar, politically unilateral projects, yet somehow Che Guevara, who is probably the most popular and well-known communist, has not yet been their cinematic topic. > <br /> "Guerrilla" has all the characteristics of an American epic story of folding the truth; there are so many concrete details that can be found here as in other similar Hollywood bios, like "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", almost none. The film is played by Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. However, however controversial and criminal the actions of this man may have been, something that no one could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why Del Toro visually adapts to the bill. Del Toro may be an interesting and charismatic actor and may look like Guevara physically, but he doesn't exude intellectual qualities of any kind, so he makes Guevara a too primitive film. Launching such mediocrities as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente only underlines the director's lack of judgment. <br /> <br /> The film is for the most part extremely slow (no surprise) and visually uninteresting. Even a genius director like Kubrick would have carefully thought of publishing a film that goes beyond the 3-hour mark, so it's pretty clear that this Soderbergh, who made only one or two solid films and at the beginning of his career, would think that La his Oceanic Grandness was up to the task. If you think that the length of the film indicates that much of Che's life was shown here - then think again. Soderbergh focuses on the last phase of Che, and much of the film is a boring nonsense in the jungle, full of Guevara's supposed idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals.) I wonder what kind of mind this esteemed director should actually choose to ignore a part of Che's previous life. Did he consider it really uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people is of no interest to the viewer, eh? Amazing. Some filmmakers who are much better than this superlatante would easily have adapted not one, but two complete biographies in a 4-hour film. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh, in a sense, becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative, dark side - which is more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, knowingly ignoring the ugly truth (God does not want to contaminate the holy image of Che), Soderbergh does not prove to be a humanist - a false image that most Hollywood and pop music personalities fight hard for all their careers sustain - but the opposite: that it only cares about ideas, never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent disdain for the "proletariat" (which is a stupid term) with which they are supposed to line up. <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world wear Che's image on their red and orange shirts, but never know why. He has become an iconic figure for young people without clues, uninformed, very often young, who think they have the face of this man on their chest that somehow makes them appear "angular", intellectual, fashionable or interesting. Actually, wear a Che shirt that underlines only the general superficiality and the total lack of interest in self-education. (Wouldn't you like to learn more about a person before you start advertising his face to the world?) The image of Wearing Che's clich√©s has become as common as having a Bart Simpson cup of coffee. All those "Che-wearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they can ever read about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After all that has been done in the name of Marx, one would think that these hybrid "ideals" would finally be put to rest. It seems that humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, the Iron Curtain, a hundred million dead, more than a billion people ruined physically and / or mentally through this system ... so nothing at all that matters, eh? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won a prize at Cannes should only surprise those who are absolutely unaware of how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote. Tip: Sean Penn was the head of a jury not long ago. <br /> <br /> For my music-related rant, go to: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
