"Dominique" is one of those films for which the expression "slow-as-melasses" was invented. Too many endless and repetitive sequences (how often do we see Robertson slowly go downstairs because he hears someone playing the piano?). It is ALMOST redeemed at the end by a surprising turning point, which, unfortunately, is followed by a second turning which only manages to leave a bad taste in our mouths. It's not a very funny movie.
