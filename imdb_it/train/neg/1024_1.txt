I saw this movie at the Toronto festival with fairly solid expectations. the film has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wisdom he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / writer from wiseguy who made his debut feature film = blah) ... well, Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating images of kevin spacey killing a homeless person, because I don't see how he (along with the other actors in the film) ever agreed to be in this disaster. <br /> <br /> this movie is absolutely scary! it's a mixture of every cop with a boiled clich√©. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the management was even worse. it seemed that episode of wisdom mentioned above. this was the best movie on the video I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> some examples of ugly stupid moments in Edison ... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to make rock and roll music ... justin timberlake receives creative criticism from his beauty while his apartment he's surrounded by candles ... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird ... 3 guys shot in the head ... <br /> <br /> this movie is the opposite of good. <br /> <br /> YOU'RE AWAY FROM EDISON!
