This is a confused and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. It is not an exaggeration: you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to get involved. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would have made something interesting to say why Erwin / Elvira eventually committed suicide but instead of that, in every scene someone is trying to explain: "when he was young, it happened. .. "and" he just returned from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything there ... "etc. <br /> <br /> Soon in the movie, Erwin / Elvira is in a slaughterhouse talking to a prostitute friend (surely a mess is the best place for a pleasant chat), and while he tells her the story of Elvira's life , Fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after another. It is difficult to choose between paying attention to disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course we come to the very forced and gross symbolism of "I suffered a lot in my life, and I'm about to die". <br /> <br /> In one of the few scattered moments when something actually happens, Erwin / Elvira meets a former lover, who only after performing an extremely gay choreography with two other guys (as if he were looking for the necessary level of homosexuality) is that it recognizes Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas, I have to admit (like when the nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything in the film is wasted due to Fassbinder's indulgence.
