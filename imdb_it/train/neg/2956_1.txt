What was he thinking of? file: Whoopi Goldberg plays a cop in the future who is paired with a talking dinosaur (!) for a crime involving a madman who wants to start another ice age. The tape tape strangeness is embarrassing and ridiculous, a high concept in search of itself. Apparently this was a labor of love for his screenwriter and director, Jonathan Betuel (who was also one of the producers); unfortunately, the final results are anemic, to be charitable. Goldberg's mere presence on the screen can often trigger good will and laughter, no matter how poor the script is, but it's drowning here and you can see the humorous results. NO STARS from ****
