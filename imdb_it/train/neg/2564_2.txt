When I go to see the movies I would be awake watching it or if I didn't like it, I would go to sleep, but this was pure shit, in fact I got up and went out .... This was badly scripted and put together, I hated it. Also, they shouldn't have taken Brendan Frasier, it was much better. This was not as good as I expected, considering that I really liked George of The Jungle 1, and the graphics were not as good as the first one, for example, the bird, and when ever it crashed into a tree. I hope the director of this aspect takes note, and upcoming films he has, he needs to reconsider ... horrible! I would really like to give Ursla a job well done, as it made the film worthwhile (until I got out) ... on the whole, I give this movie 2 out of 10
