While I consider myself a fan of the Babylon 5 television series, the original film that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that will later mature and become much more compelling in the series, the rhythm of The Gathering is slow, the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confused. Worse still, the characterization of the first episode is poor. Although the chart on the charts shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems, I remember that The Gathering almost turned me into a spectacular series.
