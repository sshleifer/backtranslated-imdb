"Dahmer" is an interesting film even if I wouldn't use "horror" or "thriller" to describe it. It is more a study of minor characters that seems strangely likeable to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner plays the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well interpreted by Artel Kayàru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the most interesting character: in love with Dahmer and once escaped from an attack, he returns to Dahmer by sex and survives a second attack. <br /> <br /> I think the film is disconnected because it does little to represent the formative years of Dahmer, how events may have created the human monster that we see on the screen and offers no idea of ​​Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims. <br /> <br /> the roles are well interpreted but the plot is subtle.
