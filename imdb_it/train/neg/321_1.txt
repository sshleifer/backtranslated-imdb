Shecky, it's a damn legend, don't make mistakes. Until recently I worked for a chain of British HiFi & Video stores, managing their test department. We would pass through many new appetizers, we would expect them to learn how to identify the various debris that are not working in one way or another from the shops. Now for tortu ^^^^^ to test the resolution of these new staff members, we released them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film, because whenever someone who bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this movie as a free gift surrendered to sending back their DVD player, they never failed to send Shecky . Our new staff would have been forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines until they found a disk or two of them to test. <br /> <br /> Now, why is this movie so bad, where do I start? <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler, who can be so, so funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the wedding singer, must have had a hell of a day off. The rest of the crew smelled, and what does Billy Zane have to do with it? His name falls in some of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The quality of production is absolute zero. <br /> <br /> I would be inclined to give a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the courage to call him by his full name "The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz" at the time of release. to see how far Sandler has come and how low he is.
