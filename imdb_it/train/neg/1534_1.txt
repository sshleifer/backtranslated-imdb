From the block-digitized movie to the acting that makes Keanu "I'm so wooden I could be a Plank me" Reeves looks like an Oscar winner that this movie bites (pun intended). The best thing is the eRATATE box in the 2nd segment (which out of three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of plot and 'twist'). I wish I spent the Â£ 3.99 that cost me on something else, like erm .... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really disappointed, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateur and with actors who are more wood than a 2x4, then move on. However, if you want a bit of quality werewolf action elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The werewolf Hunt.
