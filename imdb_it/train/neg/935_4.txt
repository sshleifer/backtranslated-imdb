Users who have rated this movie so simply cannot have seen enough good movies to compare it to. Have they all been brainwashed ?? I have rarely felt so disappointed with a film and part of it must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this film. <br /> <br /> From the first, BU is just a hunting movie. We take it at the end of a chase and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Do you see an emerging model? There is practically no time lost to plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the other two Bourne films, you're pretty lost. If you have - WISH you were lost - somewhere far from a cinema. <br /> <br /> The dispassionate style of Paul Greengrass worked exceptionally well on United 93, which was an overload of desperate sentimentality, but on Bourne and its interminable problems only have the effect of removing the public from involvement with the character. He runs. Salta. He punches. It is blown up. Clear tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all - he SURVIVED. Survives as a Plastic Action Man survives, which makes the ridiculous stunts even more loose and devoid of any kind of tension. So he leaves a building? So? Survive. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but it's just a piece of furniture. I saw more depth of character and snappy dialogues in the episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bourne's journey of personal discovery is boring and shapeless and does not tell us anything we did not know from the first film. It was turned into a killing machine. Big deal. Discover his true identity. So? It has no emotional resonance when it arrives. <br /> <br /> The "twist" finish is telegraphic and weak. Oh dear, the more I think about this movie the more I hate it! I have already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! I'd better finish now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action movie and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither one nor the other. It's a noisy and boring series of flashy changes, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea that you "show the way" to the James Bond saga is a real crap. Casino Royale blows out of the water.
