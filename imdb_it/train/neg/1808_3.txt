In his 1966 film "Blow Up", Antonioni had his hero interrogated against a backdrop of British youth protesters. By posing such questions against a fabric of hippie youth movements, Antonioni deliberately or not questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true can actually be a lie? On the flip side, the film said we must actively fight and challenge what we see precisely because others could deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most sticky parts of "Blow Up", they created a nice storyline and gave the film more meaning than it might otherwise have had. It was a small, very cautious and mature film. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point" Antonioni throws away all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes into full hippie. The result is a film flooded with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy narratives. How could anyone, who has shown such control and intelligence throughout his career, do something so silly? <br /> <br /> The film opens with a beautiful series of close-ups as we watch a group of radicals discussing the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) gets up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. It recognizes that even if revolutionaries are fighting for freedom, binding to such a militant cause means effectively liberating your freedom. And just like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger", Mark just wants to be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes alone. Take orders from anyone. When the police raid his university campus, Mark shoots a boy and runs away. He then flees to a nearby airport, steals a small private plane and flies into the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia, and contrasts it with the merciless capitalist cities, with their billboards and empty modern appliances. He sees the desert as a kind of Garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark meets Daria and falls in love quickly. Antonioni gives us a ridiculous sex scene in which hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the constraints of modern life, these tree gatherings and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism with dumping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The film ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasizing about blowing up the villas and houses of the rich capitalists who killed him. It is Antonioni's challenge for his audience. Collect weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. Shoot down the walls before they cage you! <br /> <br /> Obviously the film had no effect on its audience. They recognized "Zabriskie Point" as another commercial attempt centered on being radical. A sort of commodified radicalism. It seemed untruthful and tame. <br /> <br /> Thematically the film is rather stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are not satisfied with the modern world and the fat cats that exploit you, you should escape to the desert (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). Everything is alright. But although artists constantly warn us of such dystopian nightmares, they are mostly unable to show us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of "Fight Club", nihilism and violence get nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors, spurred on by small technological advances. I mean, which women are freed more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad film. The problem is that Antonioni does not really believe in rebellion. He is a silent and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extroverted film simply to gather more adoration from the counterculture that embraced his previous film, "Blow Up". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" appears as a very pretentious and stupid film. He's essentially a 50-year-old man who says "Look at me, I'm a brave rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films in which the public is encouraged to fight "the system", but they all fall into one of four categories. In the first category you have films like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". Everyone shows that the lives of freedom fighters end up failing, though in any case the "spirit of revolution" survives. The message is that you cannot make changes, but dying or failing, the optimistic notion of change survives through martyrdom. In essence, we must continue to fail rather than abandon hope. <br /> <br /> Then you have films like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down", which simply encourage you to explode. Tear it all up. Blow up everything. Everything is a lie, so you might as well go hunting for firearms. These films are born of angry and reactionary feelings, rather than all sorts of common sense. <br /> <br /> So you have the "Flight rather than Fight" category. Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. Movies like "The Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" show human beings running from worlds that dislike islands and peaceful havens. Both directors are pessimistic, as Malick has destroyed his islands and Antonioni has his islands that offer no sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> So you have the fourth category. Movies like "The Lives of Others" by Donnersmarck, "Bound For Glory" by Ashby and "A Clockwork Orange" by Kubrick, treat artists as a force for change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, where everyone is content to be a slave of the state, it is unbridled creativity and the freedom of the artist / criminal to keep the system under control. Simply existing outside the herd, create the waves. Your comments, actions and critical eye challenge the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film has novelists and artists that undermine Nazi Germany, while Kubrick has Alex the criminal artist / fight against the Nazi cali, painting the city with blood and sperm.
