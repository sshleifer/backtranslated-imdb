Someone read the script. This must be one of the worst writings and direction of the whole year. Three great actors, Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson failed to get him out. About two thirds it seemed that Giamatti's eyes said, I can't believe I signed the contract. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really a bad list of Christmas movies. There are not enough lines, but what else can we say? Okay, the movie doesn't just move with the dialogue with Vaughn's man, his character is just a scary guy you can't get over. It was just a lackluster walk, which no one seemed to be able to enter.
