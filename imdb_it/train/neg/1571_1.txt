Watching this movie made me think constantly; why are they doing such a problem with some broken brakes? There are a million options to slow down the car! In the movie Speed ​​the writers have at least thought of a good reason why the machine was not able to stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many positive things to say about this film; all the usual narrative clichés make their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is a loss like a sieve, etc. This makes this film a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
