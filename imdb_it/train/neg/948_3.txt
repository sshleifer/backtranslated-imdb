I tried watching this show several times, but for a show called "That '70s Show", I don't find it very different from some haircuts and the occasional reference to the disco that actually evokes the 70s - the decade I grew up . Of the episodes I've seen, most of the plots and lines could be set at any time. Take away the novelty of (presumably) set in the 70s, and the show is neither interesting nor fun. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show that best represents the experience of youth in America in the 70s, in my humble opinion, you can't do better than "The Wonder Years".
