The problem with this film is that it is shot on the worst possible camera and the film is blurred and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that the one who held the camera can't hold it because he's having an attack or something. There is also too much poop and vomit in this film. There is someone who vomits every twenty minutes and makes me think that it was done by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying sharp scream that goes on and on and on and does not stop until the credits roll. I didn't like it when all his friends were shot (or I don't know) and she goes into the van and puts up subsidies. It was really really stupid to even have it in a movie. How much gas can a person siphon to make a van go? It must be quite a bit because they don't have gas for the rest of the movie. It was a terrible film and I would suggest you never seen it in your whole life.
