With that line begins a foolish and boring English science fiction film. The great Vorelli of the film "Devil Doll" builds a teleportation machine only to have Blanchard cut the funds, a bearded man who has a weakness for bow ties and men with large eyebrows. When his experiment fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the subsidies in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to throw himself into Blanchard's house with the help of his assistant laboratory assistant, Sheila. Needless to say, something goes wrong and ends up looking like a mouse. The rest of the film is dedicated to the good orange-haired doctor who travels around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are other murders, some modest paper work, and eventually the doctor disappears where the rat doctors go. Fortunately, no one has decided to make a sequel.
