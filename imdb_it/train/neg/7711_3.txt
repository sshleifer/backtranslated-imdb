The heart of this film was in the right place, no matter where his brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a parody of "Airplane!" (two years before the fact - nice to go.) of what happens when the vegetables, or in this case the fruits, attack. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of cinematic magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-shaped tomatoes at the actors on the screen), tomatoes really attack everyone in their leafy grip. <br /> <br /> Then it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies that I wouldn't want from any part of the government to save the day. Of course there is a reporter (Taylor) who meddles in the worst moments, dancing and singing army soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed voices, a boy dragging a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, the San Diego Chicken before it grew up. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not so great. In fact, you could probably improve yourself after looking at these. Some dialogues are inefficient ("Please pass the ketchup" - not something to say in front of the tomatoes.) And as for "Puberty Love" it goes ... well, I can't blame the tomatoes for curling up feeling it. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I liked the acronym and the credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone that was pretty well done. ... that's all. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a comedy "Killer", but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
