Barbara Streisand directs and interprets this very Jewish story. <br /> <br /> To get a chance to get an education, Babs disguises himself as a boy who is not the hardest thing to do since he already looks like a boy, anyway. In his new school he meets many male classmates who have no problem believing they are a boy. <br /> <br /> Do not lose the best of many moments of involuntary humor when the male friend of Babs thinks he is a man, but he sticks "on the ground", sits on "him" and looks affectionately in the " his "eyes .... * snicker *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre film; bubbly story about nothing particularly interesting.
