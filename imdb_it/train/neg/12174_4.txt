This is a big step back after the surprisingly fun original. This sequel is not as fun as part one, and instead spends too much time developing the plot. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his heart beats in this voice. The performances are all adequate, but this time the script disappoints us. The action is purely routine and the plot is only slightly interesting, so I need a lot of silly laughs to be entertained during a "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, the laughter is few and far between and so this film is watchable.
