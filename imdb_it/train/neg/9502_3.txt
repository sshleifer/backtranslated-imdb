This film was bizarre, totally inexplicable and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a large, empty house. I love the opening things with Lisa wandering around the lost city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European setting, though maybe not in a low-budget horror movie. Definitely the ending where there are strangely non-sexual sex scenes that have been cut (in my DVD copy anyway). Don't try to figure it out, just go ahead and pay attention to the odd bits ... that's all. Don't look at it if you really want the plot or characterization or something to make sense. Pretty nice, even if you could just give up this and decide to watch a horror movie, like, Dead Alive.
