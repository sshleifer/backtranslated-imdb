I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that a film based on the book was under construction. <br /> <br /> But I was deeply disappointed in the film when I saw why it didn't capture what I loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and the interesting way it sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, I realized that things were not The same as I had imagined in the book. So, I went ahead for the trip. It wasn't so bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was totally different from what I had imagined it to be! I didn't think it would be one to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays it, is hilarious! <br /> <br /> Inside, I thought the film and the actors / actresses in it did a good job, but alas, I'm a fan of the book (one of my favorite books ever) that I couldn't to do without feeling disappointed = P
