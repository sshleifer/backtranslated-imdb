Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Virtually any film in which he has been is the best. Now old George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie ... but once he said something describing the film to a T. <br /> <br /> I don't remember his exact words, but in practice he said that great writing can save a bad deed, but great action cannot save bad writing. Never has this little observation been truer than "The new adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Mummy". <br /> <br /> The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) look not only at the parts, but do a great job of mimicking the real deal (mannerisms and everything). This film should represent a lasting testimony of their talent. That being said, this film falls on his face when it comes to (you guessed it). WRITING. <br /> <br /> Apart from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a short gag involving a taxi, this film is an absurd task to sit on. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to know why Mom wants to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I want is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-ins). Too much time for the screen was devoted to the explanation of the plot or to the not very funny secondary characters who said that the plot revolved around. <br /> <br /> However, even if this film was all jokes, it would have started us anyway with ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are those that I would call slapstick "watered down". <br /> <br /> What do I mean by "watered down"? <br /> <br /> In slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way of comic effect (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or what about Laurel & Hardy?). <br /> <br /> In a "watered down" slapstick (as I call it), a character is slightly hurt or disturbed, and the filmmakers interpret it as a comic effect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps an example would help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is hit by Elmer Fudd. His account falls and he puts it back up. This is the classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Ollie comes across some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful and continue on their cheerful path. It's not slapstick. It's not even funny. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of this kind of jokes. It is as if they were the bread and butter of this film. Writers and directors only take these boring moments and act as if they were fun. Of course, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut all this. <br /> <br /> To make it short: the film doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot's and Sartain's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script exploits the plot's exposure and the limping jokes. Watching this movie is basically looking at two excellent imitators who haven't been given any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but an incredible sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> I say you lose and keep the real deal (as long as you move away from "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
