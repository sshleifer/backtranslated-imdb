Simply not the quality I expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is very similar to a not so bad student film. What worries me, in all this is WHY HAS YOU MADE A BAFTA ??? Morris makes fun of 'enchanted mediocrity' (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) yet with this piece he urinates on the shoulders of talent and tells us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope you chose a topic that I would like to address (the humanity of terrorism - Four Lions) that does not intend to increase this situation, wasting the opportunity to make a statement about the farce of the ignorance and public opinion on this emotional and strongly spun phenomenon.
