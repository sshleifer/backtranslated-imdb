Since I and my other half are big fans of garbage horror, we couldn't resist the temptation to get out of a movie that contained both the big guys that thrilled us! However for a 2004 film with a cover of Freddy Vs Jason this is a disgrace! The worst movie I've ever seen, but it's worth a look for a laugh if you can sit down! <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible for the effects ... well, I could do better with my video camera in fact it's so ugly that they just took the trouble to put make-up on the faces of the zombies and left the neck, hands etc. No plot, weird flashbacks that don't make sense and a terrible script! <br /> <br /> "you broke my teeth!" from a vampire "you broke my cigar" was the answer from the human who looked like Uncle Jessie of the Dukes crossed by Santa Claus!
