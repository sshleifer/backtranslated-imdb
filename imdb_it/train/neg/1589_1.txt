It's amazing that a script like clich√© and completely absurd can make any screen even the smallest one. The dialogue in this film makes Catwoman look like a classic of high culture. Billy Zane plays the harmonica that sounds bad, Elvis impersonates himself, gunslinger, martial arts master who bets on the life of a former football player who became a fanatic of the game played by the winner of the NBC craptastic show "Next Action Star". His performance is ice cold and not cold. The "movie" takes place in Las Vegas, and since people play poker there, the writers felt that it was the perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive for 24 hours against a ubiquitous and wealthy player who has offered his $ 2.4 million goal if he could do it all day And so the hunt is born. A hunt that smells of insignificant explosions, settings of construction sites, poor cinematography and one-liners containing the word "bet" or "bet". Even the female winner is thrown into the mix, but for what reason I have no idea. Oh, but don't worry, the "NAS" fans that the losers also make their memorable cameos. The surprise ending will leave you speechless if you love predictability or plagiarism. Joel Silver should re-evaluate his decision to sell even more. I wish he could give me those two hours of my life.
