THE ENTIRE FILM is a flashback to Boogeyman's first film and, inexplicably, to another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love Brainwaves film. It is framed by some more current films (from the early 90s in any case) that are boring, poorly performed and shot at low cost. Not only is the film almost completely a flashback, I REPEAT the same flashbacks throughout the film. So you see the film recycled over and over again, as if you hadn't already seen it. As if the originals weren't bad enough. I've never seen such a stuffed film ... Someone was milking the last dollar from these films. Total ripoff. And let's talk about padding ... why do I have to write 10 lines on this dustbin? If I can tell you that it is garbage in 2 lines, it should be enough.
