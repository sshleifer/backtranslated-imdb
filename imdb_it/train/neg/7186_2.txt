I'm sorry for all the fans, but this is a useless film. The acting is very bad, even wood, and it dominates the fear factor at the beginning, and it doesn't work exactly. I think in the end there should have been a twist, but in the end it ended up being incredibly confusing. What the hell? The guy who was killing everyone was one of the hunted? Try again. <br /> <br /> It is not very original, nor is it particularly good as a straight slasher. And this is saying something. <br /> <br /> I think whoever did the casting, whoever wrote the script, and whoever thought the concept should be fired and deported without mercy. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. If someone puts it at a party, throw the record out the window and wear a good horror movie, like Silence of the Lambs or The Shining.
