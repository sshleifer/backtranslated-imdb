We had the free weekend of STARZ and I turned on the station to see what was there. It was this Howling II movie: The acting was terrible, but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the aforementioned eye candy. I was laughing a lot from the few scenes I saw. <br /> <br /> My friends wonder why I never want to go to horror movies, if they saw this movie they would know why. I would have been thrown out to laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of notes out of curiosity: Reb Brown who played Ben White had played Captain American in a TV movie Marsha Brown was the inspiration of Mick Jaggers for the song Mick "Brown Sugar" has definitely a great taste for women.
