* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First of all I evaluated this film 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are too many stupid mistakes in the film, failing to make it the psyching drama that could have been. First of all he never fights alone. After a very strange initial doubt on the part of her mother (which is not credible when the mother proves to be so supportive and loving later in the film), the victim of rape is not the only one. <br /> <br /> It is also incredibly naive that it always falls into the strange Crew traps. <br /> <br /> His friends are incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> The thing I find most incredible is that Ethan can't control the crew when he changes his mind. Ethan is very much the head of the crew (hey, they also say it) and people seem to think that the other is an idiot, but when Ethan changes his mind he can't convince even one person in the crew that he's right and that ex friend is wrong. Everyone simply hates it ... why ?? The film does not provide explanations. Why did he become the leader? <br /> <br /> A funny note is that my girlfriend thought I was looking at Beverly Hills when she arrived. Two actors of the same successful TV series ... a cheap way to get spectators?
