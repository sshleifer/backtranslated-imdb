Horrible film with scattered Ramones fragments. Your worst version of the average of the 70s / 80s of the fantastic boys who take care of the school with an extravagant plan. This movie is terrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys the Ramones and a school determined to fight against their oppressive administration. Forget this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want a funny B movie. The terrible acting, the terrible writing, the terrible plot with the Ramones' endorsement mark that probably needed some money, so they said yes to this movie. This is the only logical thing I can think of because this movie explodes.
