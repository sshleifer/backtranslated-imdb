I saw this film originally in the theater, when I was 10 years old. Even at that age "humor" was slightly offensive to my adolescent intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, whenever I saw Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum it would make me shudder and start feeling very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this film today, I wasn't sure why I felt this way. Apparently I blocked the memory of this film, but my negative feelings towards two of the authors remained. Apparently I forgot I saw this movie, but unconsciously I cried the pieces of my soul that were stolen, even eaten by the creators of this inhuman work. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the courage to try to look at him as an adult. I imagine that, as part of the healing process, I should probably look to face this childish fear so that I can * really * stand behind me. Regression therapy and / or hypnosis may also not be a bad idea.
