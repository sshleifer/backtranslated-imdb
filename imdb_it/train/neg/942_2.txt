I saw this late at night on the cable. At the time I didn't know that the girl advertised as "Shannon Wilsey" was actually a Savannah porn star, but she was so beautiful (and undressed so often, thank God) that I actually sat in the middle of this brain putrefied. I like whore movies as much as the next guy - more than the next guy, actually - but this was way beyond cheese and more rancid. The real annoying exaggeration on the part of the mad scientist and the almost total incompetence of the director, writers and special effects does not detract from the gratuitous nakedness that is the only saving grace of the film. Savannah, before turning into the plasticized Barbie Doll that became a porn queen, is really interesting to watch - it's gorgeous, it explodes in uncontrollable laughter sometimes, peeks out of the camera and laughs and in general it seems like it's really having a good time which is more than can be said for the public. Because even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a good part of this naked photo, she can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, ill-made and annoying movie. If you know someone who has it on video, or if it comes by cable one night, check, but don't waste your money on a rental.
