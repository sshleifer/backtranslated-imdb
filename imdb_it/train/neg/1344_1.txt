Any film with a ridiculous title like "The Bagman" should automatically attract the attention of any bad movie lover, but the plot is very different from what one might expect after seeing the DVD cover. The Bagman is not a good movie at all. It is part of the category of films that appear to have been (and probably were) filmed on a home video camera. The acting is terrible. I've never seen and seen a wooden drama from Troll 2. There are a lot of scenes with nudity and sex, but they clearly jumped too fast. The characters are idiots and completely forgettable. The ending (which I won't ruin) can easily be anticipated after seeing the first scene. Due to the approximate nature of the film, nothing apart from the horrible production values ​​is really scary (terrible attempts at realistic gore, a driving scene where the car is clearly stopped, etc.). Recommended only for fans of bad movies.
