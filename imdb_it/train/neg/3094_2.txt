**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad movie connoisseur, I must have seen hundreds of bad movies, yet "Hobgoblins" stands out from the rest in its own unique way. Bad classics like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are uniformly bad from beginning to end. "The hobgoblin" on the other hand, starts badly and gets progressively worse. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene, I thought it was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best this film had to offer. The film takes its most massive dive in celluloid hell during the painfully inept "Club Scum" sequence which is a continuous sequence of one joke not funny after another. With this film alone, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves to be mentioned alongside characters like Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be? Look at "Hobgoblin" and you no longer wonder.
