Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is made for TV but it is not. Considering the only actor in each note is Bullock (although Michael Pitt seems to be moving on to bigger and better things), it is not a big surprise that this film quickly fades from memory to be replaced by more important things. How ... remembering to close the front door when you leave. Or putting clothes back when you get out of the shower. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather, a policewoman with personal problems (not all). Together with her new companion (a wet-looking Ben Chaplin), she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. Nothing strange there, except that the criminals are a couple of teenage students who think they have planned and executed the perfect murder. As the investigation continues, a battle of wills emerges between Cassie and leading suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling). <br /> <br /> The paralyzing problem here is that the two protagonists are hopeless. Although Bullock is very nice to watch, he is credible in the role of an inveterate cynical cop like Rodney Dangerfield (actually, it would be better!). Chaplin, for his sins, is a complete non-entity and I regret that he should put this film on his CV in his attempt to break into Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt, like the suspicious mocking connotations, resign themselves adequately. As if the showy traces weren't bad enough, a story that would send someone to sleep and a highly predictable (but illogical) ending would have shot this movie in the head before it could escape. <br /> <br /> "Murder By Numbers" has absolutely nothing to do, even an unnecessary Bullock nude scene does not redeem it. Well, just a little but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is a film that will not advance the detective genre. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there is nothing to see people here. Move, keep moving ...
