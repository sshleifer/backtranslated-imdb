No one would like this film for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy the schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It is placed there with "Road House" for its absurd characters, sets and plot. The bad writing really annoyed me: "I want you to dust off those guys" instead of "... dust off those guys". The F-14s take off from the courier but, when they come into formation, they are F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal returns to work for the general who, only a few minutes before, was supervising a hidden "mental cleansing" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and uses a knife to kill the guards. So, of course, the guards throw down their weapons and even fight with knives! The hand grenade is a disaster but it explodes anyway. The small unseen fighter can fly from California to Afghanistan without refueling. Then Segal takes him back to California - the longest road, that is, through Europe - even if there is a carrier that provides him with air support at 20 minutes in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier is composed of 3 black PCs, 2 flat-screen TVs and images of calibers and maps on the walls. What fun!
