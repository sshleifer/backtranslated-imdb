Howling II (1985) was a total of 180 from the first film. While the first film was campy and creepy. The second was shabby and cheese. The production values ​​on this are rather ugly and the acting is atrocious. The first-part brother of the werewolf wants to find out what happened to his sister. ' The "scene" of the first film was badly recreated. A simple and thin looking woman accompanies her brother (Reb Brown) in the old town (Romania) to discover the mystery of the murder / transformation / death of her sister. Christopher Lee appears and disappears from time to time as a sort of essay / guide for the two. Sybil Danning and its two major resources appear as Stirba, the Werewolf from Romania. He also suffers from a bad morning face case, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprised that Philippe Mora directed this photo because he is usually a good filmmaker. The film is so obscure that it is necessary to have a torch to watch it (no, not the content but the film itself). To round off the film, get a lousy "punk" performance from a cursed aspiring "Babel". Perhaps if they forked a couple of extra bucks they could get the real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Better to avoid if you are not desperate or have lost the remote control and are too lazy to change the channel.
