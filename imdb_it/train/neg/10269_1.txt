this film is outrageous. from scandalous, I mean terrible. I had more fun watching the dry paint in my local hardware store on a day in August while suffering from migraine and heat stroke. the acting progressively deteriorated as the "film" progressed and the use of euphoric drug directors became apparent as the final scenes approached. when the fog was hit to death, he decided it would be prudent to blink on mordem. he wasn't genuinely intelligent, the astonishment of stevie could have caught him with his eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun while you get intoxicated and are watching this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
