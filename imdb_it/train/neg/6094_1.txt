I was widely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen 2) Unless you get more reviews don't be listed in the list of the worst movies of all time - which deserves to be 3) I was lucky enough - I paid five pounds for it. I saw it in stores for Â£ 15. DON'T PAY FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry 4) There are many films out there in the horror genre that do not have a correct rating (in my opinion) and give this film a higher score than they are criminals <br /> <br /> The plot summary : a boy without friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well, the magical ability to appear to everyone else as someone else. Our hero cunningly becomes a teenager and joins their band - sitting on the swings, baby-sitter. He kills them one by one until he is tracked down and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so ugly? To begin with, acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone else has compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any acting I've seen on a school stage. <br /> <br /> I bought a number of these films previously banned by the DVD company Vipco and I was not disappointed as I was at this. okay, acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in all other senses. What is the point of making this film when there is not even a gore! okay, no gore. What else can a movie like this offer? Breats? No, not even a titillation! <br /> <br /> it is true that this film can have a certain charm in its singularity, but any potential buyer / observer of this film should be sufficiently informed that this film is, at best, worth only one out of ten.
