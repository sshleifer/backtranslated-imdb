One question: why? First of all, the premise is not funny or engaging at all. They use recorded interviews and take audio to animate it with animals that speak parts. First of all, the interviews are not fun or entertaining at first, and even if they were, I'm sure they would be much more fun to watch as they originally were, without being turned into cartoons. How does this add to the hilarity? I activated the CBS Monday night sitcom line-up (which became a normal way to relax after the stressful workdays on Monday) and found this. Of course, the sitcom's line-up would still be replicated, being summer, but reviewing those episodes would have been more fun. I tried to give "CC" a chance. I really did it. When it started, I thought, well, maybe it will be fun. No. And then he continued. It was a long half hour. <br /> <br /> And I can almost see if there was a purpose, if the interviews were shown in their entirety, and they had points for them. But no, they were just one-line clips, cut and glued together very quickly. It was like a terrible version of "Robot Chicken" by Cartoon Network. I wasn't a fan of the CBS sitcom "The Class". While it was on, it was half an hour of the line-up with which I would have fought. But if it occurred to me to decide a whole season of that or three other episodes of "Creatures" ... let's say I'd take the "Class". Considering that a couple of hours have passed since it went on the air, and I come here to see that I'm the first to comment ... I guess it's a good sign that nobody has looked at it, and that it won't last long. Cartoon roadkill.
