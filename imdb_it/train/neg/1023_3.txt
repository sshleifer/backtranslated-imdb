LL Cool J performed much better in this film than I expected! He did a fabulous job as a "renegade" cop in a "renegade" department. From the beginning, he does a great job in building public empathy for his character and the situation in which he finds himself. It acts as a kind of "gentle giant" - a person whose rough exterior can scare anyone, but whose heart is clearly in the right place from the start - and does a great job. He was clearly the best character in the film. <br /> <br /> This was certainly an exhibition that will not win Morgan Freeman at any prize. After starring in films like Shawshank Redemption, this film was definitely a step backwards. His role in Edison simply did not allow him to show his true talent as an actor - and in terms of conglomeration of characters he sadly put him in ruins. There are so many ways his character (Moses Ashford) could have taken on a more crucial role. That he was not disappointed and a real disappointment. I was hoping to see more from him in this film. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should have stayed in the music world. His interpretation of a young journalist was poorly managed and not persuasive. This film is a typical action movie that (at least initially) has some similarities to the corrupt police business that LA has experienced in the past. Being an action movie, it has its share of shooting scenes, blood and guts. These scenes are generally unrealistic and painfully predictable. Looking at the beginning of the film there is little suspense about what will happen in the end - think about what you would usually expect in a conflict of cops / cops in poor condition - and has little resemblance to a real police-out shooting. <br /> <br /> What bothered me most was how Timberlake's character behaved during the shooting scenes. Start having weapons and not using them. Then, when he finally manages to use one, he shoots it as if he had fired a gun all his life. Then he runs out of bullets and he doesn't have a gun - and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything - suddenly he has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo ?! Little plot errors like this really ruined my film. <br /> <br /> If what you are looking for is a blatantly romanticized plot in a fantasy world where everything goes well, then you'll probably love this movie. Personally, I don't care what kind of movie it is as long as it's realistic. Let me believe that the story is true. This story was so obviously fictitious in so many aspects that I felt dissatisfied.
