This is another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching. The plot could be much more "thick" than it actually is and it would be better realized as a hit movie. <br /> <br /> Acting leaves something to be desired, even if you can't put your finger on what it is. <br /> <br /> This is one of those you watch on TV late at night, perhaps in the United States, simply because you can't sleep. Watch it if you want, but don't expect too much from it.
