'Mojo' is a story of fifties London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo' uses a technique to shoot the 50s often seen in films that emphasize physical differences in our times, but also represents dialogue in a very exaggerated way (due to the way that speech was represented in the films made that period); I have no idea if people talk this way outside of movies, but no film made today and set in contemporary times uses such a stylized language. It is as if the rigged speech of the writers of the fifties served a common shorthand of a past that seems, consequently, a very distant country; and therefore underlines the particular, rather than the universal, in history. 'Mojo' presents a strong performance by Ian Hart and annoying ones by Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-'Trainspotting 'career; but it looks like a period piece, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom. Rather boring, actually.
