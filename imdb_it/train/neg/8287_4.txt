This is a TV version of the story, the film begins as an episode of "Xena ...", with a little meaningful dialogue or a description of the character. It gets a little more substantial after a while, but all the characters are still cartoonists. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a wicked and sexually repressed Frollo, who lashes out for Salma to play tricks on himself. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are quite forgettable. <br /> <br /> It is also a liberal version of history, Frollo is a suppressor of the ideals of the Enlightenment, like the abbot in "Name of the Rose", and Quasimodo is a champion of freedom. The dark side of the character of Quas is ignored, even if it pours liquid on people. He is actually just an outsider because he looks different and enjoys playing with the bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Maybe the film is for children, but I doubt it, considering that Frollo has bloody bloated himself to change the desire to spank his monkey. A surrender mostly uninteresting and forgettable, but not terrible, and sometimes funny.
