Don't worry about trying to watch this terrible mini series. It's a six-hour bore, an incredible love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no warmth in this story, no real passion, no real love story. It's a dry, boring, pulled out and uninspired as they come. Nor does it satisfy the expected level of technical competence. Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more useful.
