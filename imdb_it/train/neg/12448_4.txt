Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a company in the Wild West, one of the six regular misfits that make up a touring show to challenge a tour. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but these women do not last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke, Eastwood's girlfriend at the time). It looks like Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is a female heiress who will receive her long-lost father's property only if she is married when she turns 30, so on the eve of that birthday she gets attached to the comic book Geoffrey Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what's the plot of this movie? It's hard to say. There is the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that for the first half of the film it is so haughtily insipid and hateful that when it suddenly becomes "one of the crew" in the middle of the film, it's not just incredible, but the public is well past to take care of her. There is the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this argument is not touched enough to really be the film's raison d'etre. There is the situation of Miss Lilly being blocked in the rural west, cut off from the funds that feed her spoiled luxury life (she is mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press). But should we really believe that he could not return to New York and his expected fortune if he gave him some effort? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this film seems to be that of Billy is the head of a family, a lovely bunch of losers who gather together. Is this a hot and fuzzy movie? or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even foiling a robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise non-violent film. One of the gang is arrested with an old evasion charge; Billy corrupts the local sheriff. The show tent burns; an orphanage makes them new. But numerous trivial pitfalls do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> Composing the problem is acting, or lack thereof. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the supporting cast is quite amateur. Eastwood is not at the top of his game, although he looks better simply by being surrounded by such a lackluster group. <br /> <br /> And for all this, the film limps for 116 minutes. Until what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
