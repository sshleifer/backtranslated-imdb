The same path as in most sequels follows. The first was fantastic. The second was average and this, full of bad acting and some stupid dialogue and even a lot of suspicions about disbelief, this film was weak. <br /> <br /> Too predictable and I couldn't stand that Henry Wrinkler - like the boss with that stupid eye, there was much more they could do with this. I loved the first one. I wish they would have gone further down these lines, rather than what they did here. <br /> <br /> There was too much inexplicable that had to be explained, what period was and why? old fashioned phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand that there is another one in the works. <br /> <br /> Blah!
