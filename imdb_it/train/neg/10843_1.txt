This could have been done for the devil, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen in years, the best thing about the DVD would be the case !!! I'm surprised people took the time to do something so junk and still spend money on it, I'm glad I rented it only. I suppose the real fans of this film must be sadistic and gothic to take care of it without taking any CGI or other effects, I hope Alex Chandon has learned a lesson on enlightenment and SFX to make a better film in the future, that is, if he is still at work. <br /> <br /> Note to buyers this is extremely disappointing, DON'T BUY IT !!!!!
