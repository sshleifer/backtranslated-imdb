Well, I rented this movie and found it really sucks. It's about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family, then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and likes to take a picture of the damaged building and strange things and weird movies, and then asks his father to bring it on a side trip and simply accepts, etc etc etc ..... They go to that city that nobody knows that exists (blah blah blah) And the most annoying thing is that the film ends and yet you don't understand what that is movie !!!! I saw a lot of yellow movies but that was the worst, honestly it doesn't have a description and I wish you hadn't seen it.
