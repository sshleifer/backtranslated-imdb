A ruthlessly trivial and painfully fleeting attempt to transplant Sheriff Bart's character from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles in his weekly sitcom, this is really bad as some say it is! <br /> <br /> Laughter only serves to remind the viewer unnoticed of what in this supposed comedy is destined to be a joke and how desperate laughter really is! <br /> <br /> However, it is rather interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. try his best to play Cleavon Little. His embarrassment manifests itself in every scene. It was a lot more fun in the HBO movie El Diablo than it was in this slab of cheese! <br /> <br /> Really the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
