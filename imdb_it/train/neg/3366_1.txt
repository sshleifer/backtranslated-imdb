Considering the original film version of "The Haunting" is in my top ten films of all time "I faced this adaptation with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a load poorly written and poorly executed by old tosh, everyone involved should be ashamed, the original terrified me as a child for a reason: you can't see anything, Robert Wise used an innovative photographic work and excellent lighting to generate fear and this is why it works. new version is that it relies on special effects and smart pyrotechnics to get from A to B, more sad is that the ingredients were there (actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only be seen as an example of a butcher shop in the studio!
