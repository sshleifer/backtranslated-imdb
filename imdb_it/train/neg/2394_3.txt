This film was strange ... I saw it while ingesting a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you should look it up, but the mushrooms weren't enough. I couldn't stop laughing ... maybe LSD would work. The film is a bunch of things that turn into other things and dance. It's really poor by today's standards but when it's released I'm sure it was ... one of a kind. I could see how some people thought this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting, and at the time I was on mushrooms. If you have a party or something and it's all lit up, have a little laugh.
