This self-indulgent disorder may have put the kibosh on Mr. Branagh's career as a Shakespeare movie adapter. (Released 4 years ago, not a peep from an adaptation since.) I just finished watching it on cable - good God, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> I agree with the feeling of a reviewer below who said that reviewing something so obviously and sadly horrible is a non-generous act that presents itself as acute. That being said, I will take the risk, even if only because * Love's Labor's Lost * is the perfect reward for those who have overestimated Mr. Branagh's directing skills in the past. Branagh has always been a rather disgusting director: quite literally; Star-struck; unforgivably ungenerous for his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but he loves himself more, making damn sure that he gets all the good lines). <br /> <br /> Along these lines, the sad fact remains that * Love's Labour's Lost * is not nearly as bad as the endless, horrible, bloated * Hamlet * of 1996. In fact, this film might be preferable, if not other because it is about 1/3 of the length. Branagh decided it would be a good idea to update this bad work of Shakespeare to the environment of Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, yada yada. Thus, in 1939, he sets the thing, leaving an eighth of the text intact in favor of egregious interpretations of the standards of the thirties (wait until you see the actors stand up on wires to the ceiling during "I'm In Heaven"), and casts actors not known for their way of dancing or singing (including himself). The result is such a surreal disaster that one is stunned to have never paused in horror over the whole affair after watching the first newspapers. I don't even blame the cast. To paraphrase Hamlet, "The script is the thing!" NO ONE could come out well in this hodge-podge: the famous RSC students are no better than Alicia Silverstone. Who could ever act in this thing? <br /> <br /> Branagh's first mistake was in thinking that * Love's Labor's Lost * was a film worthy of being filmed. Trust me, it's not. It is an anomaly in the canon of the Bard, written expressly for a cultured courtiers - NOT the usual audience for which he wrote. So, there is a precious play on words (and GERMAN!), References to contemporary school nonsense, Lyly's * Euphues parodies *. . . in other words, hardly the type of material to attract a large audience. Devil, it does not attract an audience already predisposed to Shakespearean comedy. The game cannot be staged without dramatically cutting the text and desperately "updating" it with any trick that comes within reach. Which raises the question, why worry? <br /> <br /> Branagh's second mistake was to think that a comedy Shakespeare pie could be served with a side order of Gershwin's jam. Clearly, the idea, or hope, was to make an Elizabethan exercise incomprehensible to the modern public, giving nostalgic American pop culture to the same era. But again, this raises the question, why worry? <br /> <br />
