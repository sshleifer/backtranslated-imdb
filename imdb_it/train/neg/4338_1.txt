really horrible ... the main actor did well ... the movie, the plot, etc. she was completely bad and inaccurate and could have been a follow-up to well ... anything that had little or no relevance to Carlitos Way ... and should be avoided as a plague by the ways Carlito loves fans ... no mention of Gail, in fact, ends up with some other bird, without mentioning Klienfelt, without mentioning how he was captured, without mentioning how he ended up in prison. .. they tried to make it like the original with the flash back at the beginning ... but to be honest when I evaluated it I was looking for a zero sign ... unfortunately I had to evaluate it higher ... <br /> <br /> It's a terrible attempt to cash in on what was one of the best films of the 90s ... overall it was about Â£ 6 and 2 hours of my life wasted ... for all the "action" in it , it was really boring, slow and predictable ... once again Carltio's Way fans avoid this fiasco ...
