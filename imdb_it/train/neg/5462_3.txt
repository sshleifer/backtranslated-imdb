This program drives me crazy! There is no humor and it is too serious to be called "funny"! It's too educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotyped and unattractive. The plots are redundant and the moral is repeated over and over again. Where's the fun? I also think this has been on the BBC for too long and is transmitted too much. Do you really need to have a space on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to start reporting some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, Raccoons and Count Duckula as well as continually giving contracts to these new shows! I thought about the BBC where to bring Danger Mouse back, so what's going on?! 3/10
