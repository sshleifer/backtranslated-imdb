It is interesting to note that all those who (so far) seemed to appreciate this film had no expectations: I guess this is the trick. In contrast to them, I had optimistic expectations, and it was a mistake. As soon as I saw how close the faces were to the camera was always, I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur director - this is always a clear sign of them, they think it is artistic or effective or intense to hold the camera at about two inches of distance from the actors. The actors in this film, however, had only one facial expression each. <br /> <br /> If the closed camera wasn't enough, the lack of light in the film killed him. The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark. So now we know that even the director of photography was an amateur. "Ooh ooh, we will light the set with a flashlight! This will make everything very intimate!" No, this made everything seem invisible. <br /> <br /> In addition to serious technical defects, there was absolutely no story beyond the slightest hint of an idea that had never been developed, and nothing new about this type of relationship was enlightened. (Maybe this is a new kind of film for Germany, but in Los Angeles, forget about it.) <br /> <br /> The fact that this film has won a couple of film festival awards does not indicate the quality of the film films, but annoys the quality of these particular festivals. I can assure you that this film will win nothing in the festival where I saw it. In fact, twice during the film it seemed like it was finally over and people started to get up to leave (this was one of the side effects of the filmmaker's "total darkness" technique). But when the film had a thrill, however, there were groans from the public. And once the film was finished, it was clear that it didn't matter if it ended up in one of the two previous points. A previous ending would have saved the public from even more monotonous scenes of domesticity (folding sheets, cutting vegetables, spreading honey on bread). Yes, we understand, the life of the old loner was boring - but we thought of it at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I recommend that the public does not see us, has absolutely nothing to offer sophisticated spectators.
