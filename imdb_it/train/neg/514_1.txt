This is one of the most insipid, weak, non-original and useless films ever made! It almost seems that everyone involved in this project has not even tried to create a catchy film. This is nothing but the continuation of a boring series of films that try to profit from the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of them all. As for this waste of films, Burt Reynolds dozes his way through the whole film, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors don't have much to do, car races are obviously filmed, humor is uninspired and many the scenes are more boring and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous film without anything unique or distinctive.
