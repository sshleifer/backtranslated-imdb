When I saw this movie, around 1979, it became the first film I ever released in the middle. There is nothing worse than the comedy that just needs to be fun, and this is missing every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original in any of the sketches. While I like unbridled humor, if any, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating is that this film was advertised as "Robin William's first film", capitalizing on his new fame in the television series "Mork and Mindy". Yet his role turned out to be so small that you can't even notice it on the screen.
