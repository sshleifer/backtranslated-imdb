This film is very similar to "Flashdance", you know that dance film with Jennifer Beals. That movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen since it's not even bad enough to be funny. "G.I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but that doesn't say much. Here Demi Moore plays a lot and there is loud music and we can see her fighting and everything, but it is certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the film is interesting, but the script is too trivial and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. Well, like I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
