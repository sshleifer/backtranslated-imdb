You know this will be a poor movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. The 50's has been made 2. It's black and white. 3. It has no name actors! 4. The scream compensates for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well, not to be outdone - this film has brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a real cinematic blunder. <br /> <br /> Okay - shhhhh but I'll talk about the special effects here - or the lack of them - <br /> <br /> Have you captured the underwater scenes? It appears to have been poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the mantle stirring in the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated re-use of Stock Footage, (exterior photos, scenes from the KRAF-Tiness bridges of this film - not from "PLAN 9" - I saw such creative use of archive material . <br /> <br /> And hey where there was a lack of special effects - don't worry - shouting for special effects in this movie too Yes, this movie also cleverly used that old trick. <br / > <br /> Take the popcorn - set your brain to stunning (some fermented drinks help DEFINITELY), sit down, and wonder: why the hell did they shoot this movie? <br /> <br /> Wayno br />
