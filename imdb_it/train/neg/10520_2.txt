The angels who have become a bit icky have been banished from the sky and now reside in a British forest where teenagers seduce and tear themselves apart. Let's talk about high concept. The positive side of this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but since his acting is limited to two minutes of screen, his five-minute presence seems a bit long. Angels roam the forest naked for most of the film, but although they may have an angel's body, their faces just look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. The mediocre acting and the amateur gore effects do not help and the night scenes inevitably recall the most famous film by Paris Hilton. So bad that it is REALLY bad.
