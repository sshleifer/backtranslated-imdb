I love killer Insects movies that are very fun to watch, I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite Shaun Hutson horror books. <br /> <br /> I met him and I wish I had listened to him as this film was terrible as he said, after he said I was still dying to see how ugly it was. <br /> <br /> The plot: people die mysteriously and in a macabre way, and no one has the slightest idea what the cause is. <br /> <br /> Only healthcare provider Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer snails is ridiculed by the authorities. <br /> <br /> Only when the body count starts getting up and a slug expert from England starts poking around does it seem that Mike had the right idea after all. <br /> <br /> This movie is the most exaggerated movie you've ever seen! The snails in this film are fast (so normal) and it seems that you quickly advance forward! <br /> <br /> This film does not resemble the book at all, the book was ten times more frightening, ten times bloody and had many more stories! <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all! Since I'm a big fan of Slugs, the book and the second book called Breeding ground! Both books are fantastic <br /> <br /> Read the book, then watch the movie, you could appreciate more than what I did Give this 2 out 10
