I lost this movie in the cinema, but I had an idea that it was worth it, so when I saw it on the DVD shelves I thought "it's time to watch it". Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars cannot save this turkey, certainly one of the worst films of all time. An incomprehensible plot is poorly presented and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I had read the Robbins novel, but unless the film is completely different from the novel, and with Robbins assisting in the script I doubt it, the novel should be a heartbreaking read. <I hope the actors were well paid as they seemed embarrassed by this celluloid waste and, more recently, for DVDs, let's take Pat Morita as an example. Even Thurman has the grace to seem at times uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Save yourself for about 98 minutes of your life for something more useful, like cutting toenails or fixing the sock drawer. Even when you see it in the basket "under $ 5" in your local store, resist the impulse!
