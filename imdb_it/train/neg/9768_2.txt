When I first entered Happy Birthday to Me, I checked the timer to see how long the movie was. I was surprised by the length. Both animated and horror films share common ground: the attention of the selected audience and should be around 90 minutes. Something more, and you will lose most of your audience. <br /> <br /> This 110 minutes, or 20 minutes after its peak, was a big deal for me. I would like to say that half of this film could have been modified, but I would be too generous to say it. Go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could have been changed, even without being a great movie. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the excited visit, the film was below mediocre. He spent all his time trying to be this huge mystery about which of the "10 elites" is killing the remaining friends. For the most part, they not only overcome it, but they magnify their faces and practically say "It's this guy! No! It's this girl!" You will spend more time with the camera fooling yourself than enjoying the movie. And don't get me started on acting. <br /> <br /> Ok, this got me started. I had to laugh at the beginning trying to remember if Melissa Sue Anderson played the character who went blind on Little House on the Prairie (later, the research showed my suspicions) because in this whole movie she seemed really blind. Strana, as an established actress, should have been the best of the group, but turned out to be the worst. Even the rest of the staff, aside from Ann (Bregman), was damn bad, but he took the cake. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a group of ten friends and one is immediately killed off. Hardly anyone thinks twice about the disappearance of this "dear" friend, so they continue their joy. Slowly, then more quickly, there are revelations about Virginia (Anderson), the main character, the past and her psychologist, which is a little more personal (AND ON CALL 24/7, apparently) than most shrinks. All the time, more and more deaths occur. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that, just like the first "disappearance", the more "better gems" vanish, the less the rest is concerned. Of course, they give a few seconds of time to say "Wow, (that person) would not escape" etc. But then they return to their sexual ways. And speaking of this, it is probably due to the horrid script, or maybe I was losing interest in 30 minutes, but it was really hard to keep up with those who liked the band since they seemed to be the sexual partners of the next or someone the next scene could be crazy for the MAX from another and better friends. SEE: the terrifying guy who kept a mouse / mouse in his pocket ?? literally ?? and it was the most obvious suspicion. I'm giving the film too much credit (and time), but how did it become part of the "elite 10" that I'll never know. <br /> <br /> But I digress, here is a mystery. Why these children target? Why does Virginia think it has killed someone, when it has never been proven ('until the end) that some of them have actually been massacred? And why does the trailer and the poster claim that these murders are "You're the most bizarre murders you could ever see"? Hell, even for 1981, most of them had been shown in one of the first two films on Friday 13? Coincidentally, Friday 13th part 2 was released 2 weeks for Happy Birthday to Me. Maybe, they talk about when they filmed it months before, but they were late for the party. <br /> <br /> When the "secrets" are revealed, believe me, you will have to rewind 3 -4x to actually get the ridiculous and inconsistent reasons, and even then, put the subtitles to get all the words of muttering victim / murderer . Although the first time, it's an incredibly exaggerated and exhilarating ending. It's almost worth looking at the whole movie again, but as a drinking game. <br /> <br /> This birthday meeting should be avoided. Is it a first draft of a horrible and illogical script? please, please know that it takes more rewrites before the role of the cameras, which contains both modes under acting or extreme than acting and is 100% unrealistic about how people react in extraordinary circumstances. <br /> <br /> Side note: when I was a child, or say 10-11 years, I loved horror movies. (Yet, strangely, pleasurable definitive pleasures, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to watch as the years go by.) We got our first VCR and recorded all the horror movies from the TV (or, MODIFIED VERSIONS). Everything I remember about Happy Birthday to Me is receiving the last 10 minutes on tape, which scared the hell out of me ?? and obviously gave away the great mystery about who the murderer was. Even though I've seen other clips from this movie, I think this is the first full-length view I've had. Fortunately, this terrible film didn't hurt me as a child. I'm older now, and I can take this garbage. But never again. <br /> <br /> Side note 2: That said, the crazy song of "Happy Birthday to Me" played in the credits (and as a result in all) continues to make me tremble. I imagine that this film (or the last few minutes) has had an influence on my childhood. Shame on you, Melissa Sue Anderson!
