I'm generous giving this movie 2 stars. the phrase "have you ever seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! with terrible writing and acting as shown in this film, it's no wonder so many are fooled by worthless TV reality shows. do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a baseball game of the royalty, you'll be glad you did!
