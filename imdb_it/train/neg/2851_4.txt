There are often battered couples (in the general sense of the word) in Huston's films: "African queen" "Heaven knows Mr. Allison" "roots of paradise" "Misfits" ... "The barbarian and the geisha" (check the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that the Japanese stuff was fashionable at the time as works like "Sayonara" "Suzie Wong's world" and "the August moon teahouse" testify. Huston's effort could be the worst of this pretty ugly lot (with the exception of "Susie" maybe). John Wayne fits the world of Ford perfectly, in Huston he is like a bull in a porcelain shop. His Japanese partner is totally insipid. dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the film from absolute boredom. <br /> <br /> Only those who are completely in love with Huston's works need to choose this, among all his other great films around.
