When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action again. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main reason for the break-up of Yugoslavia, it is not mentioned in this "documentary", which is made by Bogdanovich whose name tells us he is Serbian and his film is far from being target. He is one in the set of lies driven by the Milosevic regime. All the others are guilty only the Serbs were right and victims, even though most of the war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, even if the Serbs are one who committed genocide against the Bosnians and attacked Slovenia, the Croatia and Bosnia all the independent nations recognized by the Bombardment of Yugoslavia were not avoidable because the Serbs did not want to free the grip that their nationalism put on the Yugoslav government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations protect their interests. If you are interested in an objective documentary on the break-up of Yugoslavia, and the fact has led to documenting this is not true. You should watch "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", made by the Discovery channel and the BBC.
