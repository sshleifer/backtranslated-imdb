Okay, let me break down for you guys ... IT'S HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble did such an extravagant job on the first Cruel Intentions, then why did he do a bad job on this. I'm sorry, but this movie is stupid, true it could be improved if its series had never been aired, but be realistic ... this movie is crock! Lots of bad acting * NOTE The shower scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What kind of line is that? "Slipery when wet" ?????????? We can say DUH-M! This film has had an effort, I'll give you this, but it was too stupid! They even tried to make it fun by giving the stupid domestic accents of home that actually .... IT WAS NOT FUN! It was pathetic. Not to mention the fact that they made sure that everyone in this aspect absolutely nothing like the original cast. It's like making them look different on purpose or something! I like watching it when I'm really on board, which doesn't happen occasionally. For those of you who liked ... Okay, what were you thinking about? Could you choose this film with the other who played a lot and the fabulous Sarah Michelle Gellar? A film is golden if it has Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this film does not, without offending Amy Adams. Oh, yes since Sebastain has a heart ????? UGH!
