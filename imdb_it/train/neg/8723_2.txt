Very bad movie. Very, very, very bad film. It is a rarity, but it absolutely does not deserve hunting. The Italian Jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time, and the rest doesn't make sense. The "alligator" is not at all convincing, and many of the secondary plots go nowhere. If you're in the local video store, you might want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies, but it's not worth the hunt.
