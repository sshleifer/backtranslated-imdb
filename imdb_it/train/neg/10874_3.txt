I have just finished a marathon in this series, and I became distressed to watch as it progressed. From the romanticization of the historical elements, to the tremendous accent of O'Herlihy in the subsequent episodes, the show collapses the more it goes on. If you are looking for a low quality WW2 general fluff, then I could recommend season 1, but avoid anything after that, degenerate into a step from a soap opera, with ever worse narrative lines and sensibilities. <br /> <br /> The old black and white film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the name Colditz associated with it, and this is also not what one might hope for.
