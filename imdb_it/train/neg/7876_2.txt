During a discussion I followed after watching this film, the filmmakers claimed that one should consider this not as a film but as a thought provoker. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked by me were the lost time watching the movie. The film's expedients (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as distractions of what should have been a careful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use the film as a platform for their political opinions - usually a very boring film that preaches to the choir.
