I recently saw the first Guinea Pig movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I must admit I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film is invariably included in every list of "bad" movies and perhaps I expected more because of the advertising campaign. The truth is, I don't consider it. <br /> <br /> If I had looked at it believing that the opening text was true ("I found this tape ..."), I might have been a little disturbed by that, thinking it was real. Even without the advantage of knowing that it is not real, I think I would have understood that it wasn't at all. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the girl's reactions to what is done to her are simply not what they should be. He should scream like a banshee in pain. The fact that she is not means that it is obviously not real. I wouldn't want to watch it if it were real, but if it was more convincing in its acting, the film would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the notorious scenes: nothing struck me at all until the scalpel in hand. The boiling oil, the worms and the innards didn't bother me. I'm not saying I'm "tough"; only I wasn't able to suspend disbelief, partly because of the girl's inactivity. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me jump a little, but the hammer in my hand made it look like a rubber hand. And the final scene with the eye was again a little startled, but nothing more. I didn't want to look away and I didn't even feel sick. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because the film is about twenty, or maybe I'm just tired. The truth is that I did not find this film completely disturbing. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing in a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise to strip characters, story, etc. and leaving torture, it works on some levels. But a disturbing film, however, didn't work for me at least. <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pig with my wife, who is of the "it's just a movie" bent and wondered what the fuss was about. We need to discuss why I watch these films and my reasons are many but I include the desire to be influenced by a film. He said he didn't think any movie could be so convincing as to disturb it and he challenged me to do exactly that. I played the fire extinguisher scene from Irreversible and she was really disturbed. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if I have a point, apart from the fact that we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror genre film than any film so far that aims to disturb.
