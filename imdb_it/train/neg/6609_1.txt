I can't say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made, because I haven't seen all Bollywood movies, but my imagination tells me it could be. <br /> <br /> This film looks like an artistic suicide attempt on behalf of the director, and I for one believe it was successful in its mission. No A-series actor outside this film would risk sharing the same billing of him for all the humiliations that this film is meant to bring with it. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director here, there's the director of photography, who seems to be rehearsing for the best home movie of the year award. There is the dramatic score, which he hopes to take you to the next scene. The man of lights, who had to hold a cigarette in one hand and a light bulb in the handle in the other, and hope that the flame that went out of the cigarette added that much needed light to every scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are not newcomers at all, otherwise everyone could be forgiven here. The Aag ensemble of actors was put together to promote a new beginning and a new dimension for the re-make of India's most beloved film of all time, 'Sholay'. We must not forget that these actors were not forced to participate in this film, they are A-list and willingly participate in something that, let's face it, would certainly have had high and greedy public expectations ??? So he begs the question, Amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe that their performances also tried to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a movie? Don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a public demonstration of how much money he talks about so they can make actors walk. <br /> <br /> I really hope everyone is satisfied with what is really a vulgar attempt to redo a classic film, which only pollutes everyone's mind when they look at the original.
