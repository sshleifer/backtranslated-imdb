A noble effort, I imagine, but in the end a poor one. Before seeing this film, I heard that "Bartleby, The Scrivener" could not be broadcast. After seeing it, I still do it. Unfortunately, I think that only those who have read the story will understand what is happening, and they will be upset by the useless revisions of the film (update from 1850 to 1970, passing from New York to London). Even the superb talent of Paul Scofield cannot save what seems to me a well-intentioned but misguided effort to film the metaphysical classic of Melville.
