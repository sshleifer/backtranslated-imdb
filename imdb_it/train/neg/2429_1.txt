Scary .. Scary Yes !! Full of nudity (from fat people to very thin people), Maslin Beach takes place on a nudist beach in SA <br /> <br /> I saw this film for the first time two years ago - it's safe to say that it did a bizarre topic of discussion at school the next day. This movie was horrible! Hardly a romantic comedy - just a showcase of nudity! This film has reached its lowest point with one of the new-age characters staring between a girl's legs. <br /> <br /> Girl: You won't find God inside! Guy: Nah, But I think I found heaven. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, unless you want to hear amateur actors discuss topics like farting, adultery and the process of genital superlguing together. TO AVOID!
