A slasher film, made in the early 1980s, has a curse on it that has someone trying to finish it and become dead. Years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the film, resurrecting the film's deadly curse. Great idea for a movie, but sadly "Cut" is just another wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia has not had the best resume in the world when it comes to horror. "Razorback" (1984) was a real outfit like "Holwing III" (1987), which was still half an American film. As for our incursion into comic horror, "Body Melt" (1993) is best left forgotten. The problem with "Cut" is that the producers try to create an intelligent horror satire in the "Scream" (1996) but they have no idea of ​​what or how it works. And although this seems strange to me to say this about a slasher film, but what "Cut" really lacks is a "heart". Surely it follows the basic "rules" established by "Scream", but does not want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the previous one. <br /> <br /> The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and non-charismatic villains in the history of horror cinema. His endless burst of jokes, limping one-liner would make the dialogue of a porn like Shakespeare. The cast never seems to get completely involved and he seems to be just waiting for the filming to be finished, so they can collect their checks. And the feeling of the film is as if deliberately trying not to be scary; looks more like an episode of "Neighbors" or "Heartbreak High". By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinemas during the "search" sequence seem just boring, outdated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia had the chance to do horror again (which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the book "Mad Max" (1979). Instead of trying to copy the United States, we should try our interpretation of the genre.
