I took this film in a small screening held by members of my college's gaming club. We were warned that this would be the "reefer madness" of the games, and this movie more than delivered. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks plays Robbie, a young man who resumes his university career after having "rested" for a semester. What we, the viewer, discover as the film progresses, is that Robbie was hopelessly addicted to a role-playing game called "Mazes and Monsters", a game he re-familiarizes with after a group of players recruits him for a campaign. <br /> <br /> This film is laughable on many, many levels. A scene presents the "play by candlelight" group, which is probably the best way to describe it. While I'm sure this had to be "sectarian" somehow, as many players know, it's horribly inaccurate. Most role-playing sessions take place in well-lit rooms, usually on some chee-toh and a can of soda. <br /> <br /> Acting, though not Oscar-level, is not terribly terrible. This is one of the first roles of Tom Hanks, and Bosom Buddies and Bachelor Party were still a year or two on the horizon. The supporting cast, although not very memorable, still offers decent performance. <br /> <br /> Primarily the nastiness lies in the fact that it was a TV movie showing the "dangers of the game". see if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night.
