Have you ever heard that people "telegraph their intentions?" Well in this film, the actions of the characters do more than telegraph future plans: they come home drunk and make you head to head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtz is not mysterious, just wood, and Kenneth Branagh fails to convey the cheeky charm that his character probably was written to have. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikely characters and grotesque "southern" accents used by British actors.
