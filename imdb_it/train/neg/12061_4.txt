Charles Bronson plays Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named Duke (Juan Fernandez) who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed Crowe's daughter (Amy Hathaway) in this vindictive but elegantly piloted thriller. Kinjite may not be suitable for everyone with its plot weaves, but it's well done and really fun.
