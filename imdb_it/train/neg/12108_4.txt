I just had to write that lining, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest voice I've seen in recent years. I have praise for all those involved in many aspects except the most important one, the script. It's a weak story of a small criminal. No amount of fine acting or a black and white film style can make up for the total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I heard he will make another film about the general. My advice is not to waste your time.
