A man wakes up from a nightmare for bats. He and his wife go out to the desert for a honeymoon picnic. It seems to hear a strange noise, and is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling on the picnic blanket. He wants to take a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but he wants to enjoy his honeymoon. She surrenders. They go on tour, but leave the group to distinguish. It falls down a slope, where it is disturbed by insects. He follows her. He hears the strange noise again and seems to know that a bat is approaching; you do it and put it in your hair. He fights and attacks him, biting his forehead. <br /> <br /> Comes out of the cave, but when I'm in a gondola at a ski resort, it starts having convulsions where it has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. He gets angry when this happens. He is unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. His wife worries about anger and starts a Pasteur treatment for this, but reacts violently to the injection. <br /> <br /> And then some people are killed. We see parts of the transformation of man into a bat person. It seems that he is not alone in his mind. If the bite of the bat causes these transformations it is not clear, since he was already having some symptoms before the bite. <br /> <br /> While the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. Not a great film, but I liked the variety of the desert, the caves and the ski slopes and some of the strangest scenes. I didn't think it was as bad as others do, and I didn't think the 1999 Bats movie was as bad as others think (I rated one at 5/10).
