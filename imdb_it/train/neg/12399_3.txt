The supernatural and vengeful police officer is back for a third episode, this time as the guardian angel of an unjustly accused policeman. Standard image of the stem and the bar, but well executed and direct, making it strangely interesting and watchable, although the violence is not for the squeamish (in particular the director's cut that originally received a "NC-17" score). > <br /> * 1/2 on ****
