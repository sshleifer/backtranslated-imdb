Vijay Krishna Acharya's "Tashan" is too stylized and stylized. It is certainly one of the most elegant films, but when it comes to content, the masses will also reject this. Why? The script of the film is as amateur as a 2 year old child. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all time can do nothing. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars that appear in it. But nothing on earth can save you if your script is bland. Thumb down! <br /> <br /> Performance: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he have a role like this? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact it is the only thing that saves. Kareena Kapoor has never been so hot. It is beautiful and leaves you all standing. Saif Ali Khan does not get his debt here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> "Tashan" is a boring film. The failure of the film at the box office, you should stay away.
