I never considered myself very "student" when it comes to watching movies, watching them, forming an opinion and that's it. But Unhinged has changed all this. This film is undoubtedly the most inept attempt to make films I've ever seen. Every boy who culminates at the university thinking he is the next Spielberg or Tarantino must be handed over to this film with a manual entitled "How not to make a film". Not only is there no story, the directors were not even competent enough to make a movie worth watching. It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is look at the shots above the heads in the opening scenes. They never end! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, but it's not so funny.
