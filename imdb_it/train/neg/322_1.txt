I saw this film about 5 years ago, and the memory of this still haunts me today. I was fully aware of how terrible there must be, so I only blame myself. But like most, I didn't believe in all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it seemed inconceivable that one of his films could be really that bad. I thought they were just those who hated Sandler. I could not have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that doesn't even contain 1 second of something fun. This is actually quite an achievement. You could think of it in a 90-minute comedy, which might have happened to come across something even remotely funny. But no, it's just awful. It's not "so bad it's good", it's just bad. You can't laugh at how ugly it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that makes you laugh, but it never comes. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a videotape and die 7 days later? If this film were on the videotape, people will die instantly, with their own hand, and there would be a smile on their face when they realize their agony is over, and that would be the first smile since they played the game. <Br /> <br /> You might be inclined to look at it just to see how ugly it is, unable to curb your curiosity. Do not do it. Please don't do this. Trust me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who think that Going Overboard is the worst movie ever made and those that haven't seen it yet.
