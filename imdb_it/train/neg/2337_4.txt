I don't know what the exaggeration is about this ... This is really a bad movie ... it didn't do anything for me, the only downhill scene is where everyone gets together at the party, and a good song is playing, edifying beat and pleasant movie shots that make you move .... that was the best part of the film ... Otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the spectator in. There is no story, there is nothing to think about like some say, there is no cohesion between different stories ... it was more than an attempt to redo Anderson's "Magnolia", which was brilliant, but obviously fails ... Ok, it's light and easy to look at , but even those are videos. Maybe first write a story before shooting a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
