SAPS AT SEA <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> (Black and White) <br /> <br /> Suffering of "hornophobia", Ollie embarks on a "restful" boat trip, but he and Stan mingle with a convict on the run (Rychard Cramer). The result is chaos. <br /> <br /> This long comedy, an OK voice that still looks like a mere imitation of Laurel and Hardy's best work, marked the final collaboration between L & H and producer Hal Roach. Episodic in structure, the film culminates in a memorable ocean voyage after The Boys is taken hostage by the evil Cramer (who shoots a seagull to show how hard he is!). The gags are fine, but the inspiration is missing, perhaps due to the recruitment of director-actor Gordon Douglas, previously responsible for Ollie's first solo attempt in the sound age (ZENOBIA, produced in 1939), but whose work is missing here of a pzazz measure. Fair, but nothing special. Regular customers of L & H Charlie Hall and James Finlayson make guest appearances.
