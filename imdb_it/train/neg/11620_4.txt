I gave this more than a 1 because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story and caused some thoughts and comments from my wife and me. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess that I came out feeling as if I had been beaten in the head with God this, God and Christ is our saving stuff. The film and the plot didn't need it. If, like me, you are a Catholic or a Christian who is recovering, avoid this, it will make you sick. The film did a good job in demonstrating the fine line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what could have been.
