"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is another "feeling good", the so-called "heart warming", and the out-for-rated ratings show that the ABC has had time to put together. <br /> <br /> I understand the problems these families go through. For that, I'm sorry. But wouldn't you think that putting four large-screen plasma TVs, three flat-screen desktops, an in-ground pool takes up half of a yard, and closets full of expensive designer clothes is too BIT for ANY family? Of course, these families have spent a lot. Of course, they deserve more beautiful things than they had previously had. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things that Ty Pennington and his team put into these houses are enough to fit into an entire neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that bothers me about this show is that Ty and his team always have something good to say about every little thing about family or family conditions. Tell a person in a wheelchair that he or she is "so strong" or "very brave" becomes really old after a while. It might seem rude, but believe me; watch this show, and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overrated. If you want to watch it, go ahead. This comment is only a glance for what you would be looking at.
