In a sense, the underlying concept of the plot was a rather interesting mixture of different types of typical films in an interesting combination. However, in this film it was not so obvious that he did not deserve close shots. I felt like I was beaten in the head with the so-called mysterious explanation of the disease that kills people. <br /> <br /> The writer seems to have simply raised the clich√©s of other films as a substitute for writing lines adapted to real characters. The actors didn't help things. No chemistry I imagine they would have to develop some kind of attraction if only for the reason that such is an essential element of these stories. However, writers have not worked very hard to develop chemistry. Of course, they are both attractive, but if they are attractive to one another it seems to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The confidence that Turner's character shows on Saturday was developed too quickly and without a particular reason. The character of Saturday should be a discredited doctor who doesn't really seem to play by the rules. Think of the character of Jeff Goldblum on "Independence Day". Usually, that kind of character should show some kind of talent or brilliance. The character of Sabato no. It is Cassandra with the only crazy and prophetic abilities of a magic ball. Seems to be right at random. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are comical. Each actor was really looking for more than a little hard to show the agony that was inflicted on them. The symptoms seemed a bad premonition, a bit like the 1980s video, Peter Gabriel, I think.
