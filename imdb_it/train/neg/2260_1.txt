Oh, dear, Jerry could be the undisputed king of talkshow, but movies are a completely different ball game, and it's really out of reach. The screenplay for this film is so poor that it has to be seen to be believed and it is sad to see actors so vaguely familiar as Michael Dudikoff (the action of the 1980s by King B'movie), Michael Jai White (Last seen Sci Fi "Spawn" flop) and William MacNamara of Surviving the Games (who is involved in just the fun half of the movie!) has dropped so much for the occupation. If you're a Jerry fan, follow his TV show because it's a total waste of an hour and a half. After having finished listening to it, I managed to capture the last half hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which in comparison seemed like a cinematic masterpiece, I think it's more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
