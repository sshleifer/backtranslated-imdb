This ridiculous film offers the "hippie mentality" of the standard 70s in a nutshell and bores us in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize the absurd marriages of innocent young women with sex-age demons and washes. A naive young hippy played by waif-like (Kay Lenz) hitchhikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day he meets the ridicule (Holden), already in old age, drinking alcohol and washing himself as an actor and decides that he is "love" with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole movie encapsulates these scenes. He goes on to say how much she "loves him" and she met him alone, consumes herself thin and very fast. I couldn't help laughing for the whole movie. It is obvious that you are only using it as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to think that we will actually buy that there is some love in place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I had to accelerate because it almost inspired me to vomit. A wide offer of 70s music also spreads through the film. Avoid this if you can. Degree D.
