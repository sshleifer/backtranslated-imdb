This film was quite interesting ... I had to watch it for a university lecture on India, yet the synopsis tells you that this film is about something when it doesn't really contain much cold and difficult information about those details. It is not really true synopsis until the end where they try to tie all the elements. The gore factor is superb, however. Even at the very beginning, you want to look away because the blood is quite intense. Watch this movie only if you want to see a bit of cold blood, because the plot is thin and it will make you sad that you lost time listening to it. I have seen rumors on other websites about this film based on real events, however it is not possible to find any information about it online ... so in practice this film was a waste of time to watch.
