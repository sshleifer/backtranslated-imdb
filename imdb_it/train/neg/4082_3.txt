This film was painful to watch ... not in the dramatic way that makes you shiver with emotions for well-developed characters in dramatic situations (yes, I practically made the last sentence while I went on), but in an absolute boring way for more two hours. Now, all of you might think that I'm just an ignorant critic who has no respect for Shakespeare or "artistic production" ... well, you're wrong on both counts. I love the works of Shakespeare, in particular the tragedies of Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet, and I have seen many "author" films like the surreal and well-made Eraserhead and Fellini of 8 1/2. .. but this has been little more than two hours of Shakespeare lost in the translation, WAY too nudity (I can understand artistic nudity in SOME scenes ... but not in every other shot of a film !!! IT WAS LITTLE AND SERVED NOTHING FOR HISTORY !!!), and basically just over-zealous films. I had great expectations for this film as it was said to be "very artistic" and was an adaptation of Shakespeare's Storm ... but this was just an extreme delirium. I gave this film a three ONLY because of the recitative presence of Sir John Gielgud (who far surpassed all the no-names in this film) and the cinematic / set design combination, as many scenes look like paintings in motion .. however, a lot of this film would have been better as a painting with a scroll of text underneath it. A real disappointment ... maybe if Zeffirelli had been given the director's chair, it would have been much better. But this is the opinion of a member of the public, many others may appreciate it much more than I do. Having said that, if you can't find it in any video store nearby (it's not currently on DVD), don't try to get too far from your street to find it ... it's not worth it.
