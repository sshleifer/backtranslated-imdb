This film begins to present an idea in some original way, but later it has become a great frustration. What is the problem of having an original start if the rest of the film has done little to avoid a cliche plot? The film itself is truly incredible. I would like to know how exactly someone enters a clinic, takes a nurse's dress, kills a doctor, pulls out a patient in his bed, puts in his Chevy pick-up and leaves? I guess nobody can answer this question, so they jumped to the other scene hiding these little details. The performances are simply ugly. The villain is just another "annoying crazy antagonist", no depth, totally linear character. After 20 minutes of film, most of the scenes are incredible, they seem to have been put there only for the 90 minutes since they were completely useless. A doctor sees a woman clearly subjected to strong medical care, is denied to examine her, is she thrown out of the house and simply leaves quiet? The final scene blew me up in laughter, only Mickey Mouse could make it more realistic. I'm giving 2 out of 10 for the first one lets say 10 minutes of film.
