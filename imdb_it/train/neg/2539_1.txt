It must be one of the worst waste of the 35mm film ever released to the public, the sequel to the original film "The Legend of Boggy Creek", at least for the fun pseudo-documentary. Bad script, worse acting, etc., Dawn Wells had to hope that Gilligan came to save her and take her back to the island to escape this piece of trap.
