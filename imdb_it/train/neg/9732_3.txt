First of all, the protagonist, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee it will ruin it for you. If you don't take it too seriously, then it's really fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - between dodging fire jets firing from her arm into the car. Another fantastic scene of the campy was to see John Landis as a brat radio program producer who softened and agitated around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the film like a non-stop laugh-I'm not sure if Tobe Hooper wanted it to be like that.
