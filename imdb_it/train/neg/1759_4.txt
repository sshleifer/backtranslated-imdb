This effort was like a gorgeous TV movie ... I don't remember it ever being released in theaters ... If so, it must have died quickly. Looking at the DVD, in the comfort of our bedroom, it was obvious that this film was not destined for much else ... Is Lauter an art critic with a vein of greed? What a fun turn it must have been ... I haven't seen Ed from "The Longest Yard" ... Everyone else has practically acted based on numbers, led by Baldwin, except for Pompey ... He had zero charisma and seemed to be the sleepwalker through most of the image ... Pompey's daughter had a size ... she played every scene like an adorable little puppy ... the slowest line delivery of any 3-year-old boy I've ever seen ... <br /> <br /> The chase scenes gave my wife and I a headache ... too much speed and anguish ... If you are going to shoot a chase scene in Barcelona, ​​you could want some WIDE shots to take advantage of the beauty of your background, right? The whole story was pretty far-fetched and far-fetched, but hello, we liked it better than "The Life Aquatic ..."
