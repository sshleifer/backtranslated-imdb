First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and it's simply horrible. This film has every horror move in the imagination, and everything played badly. Too sexy teen couple. The comic (not) horny jock. The pussy brat. The creepy local colored dude. The parental type couple. The virginal chick that incredibly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully horrible and delivered with the depth of a children's pool. It's almost like I'm wishing they all died sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, it just got worse. Sure, the funniest thing here is that the ghoul is trying to eat Jameson prostheses, but this barely even applies to renting this dog. Avoid at all costs.
