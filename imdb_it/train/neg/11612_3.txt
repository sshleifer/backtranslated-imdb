Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self-titled debut, this time it's a film that is played for erm ?? He laughs. During a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as one might expect, embedded in concrete. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by the mountain man Waldo Gronsky. Rome is immediately at risk while it has to investigate some types of mafia, which topples the tables and he is discovered as the main suspect, now he must go on the run and hope to solve the case on his own. The burly Sinatra struggles to sell us jokes and makes us believe he's a good detective, oh not to mention being sexually attractive to foxy Raquel Welch, but failing miserably in this ham-fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable highlight that surrounds every female is quite surprising, every woman in the film is a head of reassurance, who likes to bend over is facing the camera, director Douglas obviously forces you to zoom in on the cracks of their asses every time you flex your muscles rear. There is also a ridiculously campy gay character who has begging beliefs, this was a film made by "real men" for "real men" to reaffirm his flagrant sexuality, he is a vile shame.
