The fifth "Black Emanuelle" that I saw has, potentially, the intriguing plot that confronts the intrepid female reporter who investigates the white slavery / prostitution that takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her hometown, New York ! The film is populated by former veterans of the series who, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely Ivan Rassimov (who appears here at the head of a UN committee for Third World countries!), Karin Shubert (as a rival feminist journalist) and Don Powell (as driver of Rassimov). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite being shown in the middle of the night), it is strongly modified and a particularly graphic scene (described in "Stracultr) in which an Asian slave trader gets his well-deserved sodomy from a dog is nowhere to be seen here! Still a harrowing sequence late in the film when a squalid politician deceives a couple of girls (including, of course, Gemser and Shubert) in a midnight encounter under a bridge of New York with a bunch of tramps (this is how he gets their votes, take it!) - with his high-society friends looking at us dizzyingly - he looks pretty much intact. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from the gems Eric's propensity to fade completely every time he enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is his excursion to India to interview a charlatan / Guru (George Eastma n rigged to look very similar to Christ!) who found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; sure, when Emanuelle calls him, he ends up with premature ejaculation ... !!
