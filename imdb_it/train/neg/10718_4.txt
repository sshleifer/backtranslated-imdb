Come on, Tina Fey, you can do better then. As soon as the film started, I knew how it would end. Of course, sometimes it was fun. Even laughing out loud funny. But there are not enough laughs to save this movie. I don't recommend buying it. At most I recommend renting it, but that's all. Baby Mama has some funny scenes but it is predictable and fails to have the burning conclusion to fight for. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher have both done great things and they do well in this. But this is not the best Baby Mama has had a great supporting cast. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add great beauty. <br /> <br /> Another movie of pregnancy has hit the world of cinema. After the great success of Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama looks very average when compared. Knocked Up and Juno are fun, moving and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face. The end of Baby Mama was little fun and boring. <br /> <br /> Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year and does not try to be. I recommend it but I don't expect it to be completely hilarious. Expect a media comedy that does not give the great emotional ending that it tries to have. I give Baby Mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
