What a powerful start to a movie when the character of Julia Roberts is punched in the face by the abusive and anal husband played by Patrick Bergin and I felt ready to experience a powerful movie on a level with Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says, I was misguided. This film did not resemble The Burning Bed, which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you really felt for, and felt his pain and need to survive. Sleeping with the enemy moved away after the first act in an economic thrill with Roberts pretending his death to escape her husband and move in Iowa. At first her husband believes she is dead but she begins to become suspicious that she may still be alive and put her on the road. The rest of the film is basically a game of cats and mice with Julia taking a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity ... there is no mention, of course, of how she got the money for this , but at this point in the film I didn't care much. He meets a guy (Mr. Nice Wimpy) and falls in love with him and her husband finally manages to reach her, but not before reorganizing his soup cans and straightening the kitchen. This was the prerequisite for providing an economic thrill to the public. But I didn't care if she was a battered wife because the film, as I said, defrauded the public. If the course remained, I could have felt for her and her situation. Obviously the husband is killed and all is well with little Mrs. Roberts. If only the real world was something like this ... See the Burning Bed and understand what a movie about domestic abuse should be.
