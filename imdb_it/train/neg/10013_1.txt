A worn-out plot of a man who takes rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally frayed plot of a stranger inside that is eventually excluded. <br /> <br /> With such an exceptional case, one might think that the film would be above its trite origins. But scene by scene drone without intensity changes, arcs of characters and inexplicable behaviors. <br /> <br /> The issue of homosexuality was completely useless - or, on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only to titillate the spectators. When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically produce a more compelling image? <br /> <br /> A terribly scary movie. When will Lauren Bacall choose a good one? I expected better from her and Kristin Scott Thomas. This is definitely one to lose.
