This is a sad film about this woman who thought that her ex that she loved so much was probably dead, but in reality her father had just put a spell on him to turn him into this cute shark. A bit like in Beauty and the Beast. He could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some candelabrum chant, but there are some rather coarse plants. They make this girl a real itch so she lets herself be taken by a shark instead of ruining the whole movie. The boy scientist is a good dad who tries to reunite his fish shark with the woman he was engaged to, he also organizes for them having a private time to have sex, but the woman in this is a really superficial snob and thinks of the shark he is an ugly ugly monster and wants nothing to do with him. He gave up love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was rather sad that all he had to do was kiss him and that he would return to normal and live happily ever after, but it's not that kind of movie.
