"They Are Among Among" is the ultimate science fiction. The mediocre acting in this film. The holes in the plot are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth with a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but they need a plastic surgeon to make them look human. In their alien form they presumably have exotic skeletons (which is why they need plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and nails. The heroine's father "disappeared" after the closure of the Project Blue Book, but was presumably an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to watch an alien invasion movie, choose "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and see how well it is done.
