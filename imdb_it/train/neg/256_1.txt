What? Should Jamie Foxx be fun? Do you really think it's funny? Well, it's fun to watch her safety in being funny. The man has no identity whatsoever ... I mean, you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he really tries to imitate them in most of his films. The only problem is that it hurts, unevenly, and what comes out are some parts where it looks a little like Denzel, with that macho-s ** t attitude and then abruptly goes to be Martin Lawrence, the funny comedian and clumsy. There is no personal touch to this, I mean that it does not contribute to the personality that tries to sell, and I'm sure it has nothing to say personally. He is really Mr. Dull-boy in person. <br /> <br /> I was really hoping for Hollywood, and the black community in America would have found someone better to launch into the super star, like Don Cheadle, but maybe the pathetic Jamie better represents the generation that remixes the old.
