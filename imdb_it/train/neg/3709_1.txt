First of all, I'd like to say I'm a fan of Chris Rock. I like his other films, but this film is like my summary. The Biggest Sack of Crap ever. At the beginning, Chris Rock plays an aspiring comedian who is afraid of the stage in a comedy building called Apollo. Coming home from a concert, while driving his BIKE he sees this woman he likes and is hit by a truck. Shortly thereafter, he chooses the body of an old, white and selfish millionaire. Then, he dresses like the Outkast band as he tries to reproduce the original scene in which he comes out like a jockey. Secondly, he returns to Apollo and tries to be the comedian who tried to be in his previous body and begins to dig up the white population and try to be black. Did you understand? This movie is terrible and tries too hard to be like the original and in the process comes out like a lot of shit. Just take my advice, don't even watch this movie.
