at the movies, this movie looked like one of those specials after school, just a lower budget and all the rest. I guess this is due to an inspirational movie of some sort, but it didn't work for me. how preachy.it has the very clear nuances of Flash Dance, but then? there is no excitement in this film. Dialogue is forced and cliché until death. Of course, the whole movie looks like a bad cliché from the 1980s. the acting was less than stellar, although this has a lot to do with what the actors have given (or in this case) not to work with. On top of that, the poorly chosen songs, with really bad lyrics. I felt embarrassed for all the actors involved. They all have talent, but you can't tell from this film. This is just my opinion, of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream to Believe at 1/10
