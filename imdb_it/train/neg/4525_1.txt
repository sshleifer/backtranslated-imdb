Some beautiful landscapes, but the story itself - in which a self-proclaimed Egyptologist (Lesley-Anne Down) visits Egypt and, in the course of becoming an Egyptologist, things in the most non-egological way (for example, flash photography in tombs, the management of the old parchment, etc.), discovers a black market war and in some way (in the space of two days, not less!) it becomes the epicenter worn by a war suit - it is more disconcerting than any enigma never proposed by the Sphinx. Down is just as horrible as the visiting British scholar (who seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of Egypt and even less about the antiquities is the writers' fault, of course, but that is boring because everyone comes out because of him) and the rest of the cast , including Sir John Gielgud and Frank Langella, seems completely confused by the process as I was. In short, it's not what you'd expect from Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton) and co. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking for a ridiculously dated scene in which Down rails against all male scholars, blaming her for failure as an academic, while bathing in the faintest light that Hollywood could muster. Finally, he spends the next hour in the film, squealing and tormenting himself and running into the arms of any guy I can find. Wow, talk about your performative irony! <br /> <br /> * Note to aspiring Egyptologists: take a year or two of Arabic at the elementary school. It will really help in the long term ...
