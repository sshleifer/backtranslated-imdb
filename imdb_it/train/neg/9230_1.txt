I should qualify that title now that I think about it. Checkout is not entirely without value. I had the opportunity to see him twice, and the second time I had a great laugh at the expense of the movie. so I guess it's worth it for that. and also worth it for the excruciating pain that caused me to my first vision. as another reviewer has pointed out, this film is trimmed in every sense. not a single original thought went into this film (which makes the comment below on the originality of the premise completely disconcerting to me). the film is nothing but a long series of clich√©s that are put together and paraded like a movie. it's definitely not the next Clerks, it's not absolutely original, and it's definitely not "good, clean, fun". the film is anguish for the uninitiated (after having seen it for the first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an offensive way). as I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost everyone, except perhaps the elderly, was completely bored or grieved by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes, like the one in which Nick chews his mother, the audience was really acting up because it was so badly done. I even heard someone * moan * in the theater, something I had never seen before. I don't care where you get the chance to see this movie, be it a film festival, or an independent theater, or anywhere. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you are like me and can not resist the opportunity to see what could really be the worst movie ever made.
