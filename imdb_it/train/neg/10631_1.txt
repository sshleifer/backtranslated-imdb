The views of the Earth that have been claimed in this film for being simulated by NASA have recently been compared with historical meteorological data for the period of Apollo 11, and show a good correspondence between the cloud models in the video sequence and the actual records of precipitation in the day. <br /> <br /> This would seem to undermine the whole argument put forward in the film that the image of "the whole Earth" is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window. <br /> I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to assert that the historical data of the time have been falsified by NASA, even if this would undoubtedly also replace every copy of a newspaper with a meteorological map, and those in private hands would still have been a problem. <br /> <br /> Ah, an answer: "Trying to discredit this film by referring to the NASA weather data, I would say that it is a fascinating subject, but weak and gullible. Movies and tests in the film? A wise man a once he said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you think in any way that maybe this could apply to what you're trying to do here? :-) This movie is chock full of irrefutable evidence against the claim made by the US government "That lunar missions were a success and that man is now a true master of the universe. Things are almost never what they look like. Just watch the movie and, dear, you'll see things a little different from before." <br /> <br /> First of all, the weather data does not come from NASA Secondly, the meteorological data undermines one of the main claims of the film: thirdly, far from being "full of irrefutable evidence", the remaining claims in the film were comp letamente resized. a previously secret piece of film, so he modified it and added his interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his original film is in the public domain, and the parts that Sibrel modified have contradicted his claims.
