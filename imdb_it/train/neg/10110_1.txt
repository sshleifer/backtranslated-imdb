This film was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not even kidding. He was badly done and the actors could not act. It was a waste of time and money. It looked like a movie that my friends and I could have made ourselves. The case in which the film arrived is certainly a disguise. Nothing in the film looks like the zombie on the front of the case. It seems that the director or makeup artist has just put an eye liner under someone's eyes and called them zombies. The titles at the beginning of the film take up almost 20 minutes of the film. Watching the credits was the best part of the film. This was honestly a terrible movie and I couldn't believe how much it had been put together. The scenes jumped from one thing to another and sometimes you were like "what's going on?" The audio was horrible and the action scenes looked like a couple of teenagers joking around making a fake fight scene. <br /> <br /> IF you are thinking of renting or buying this movie I would recommend you to at least watch the trailer because it shows how terrible it is. I wish I had seen it before I rented it.
