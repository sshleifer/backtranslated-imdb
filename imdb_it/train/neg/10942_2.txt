Lorenzo Lamas plays the role of Jack `Solider` Kelly, a veteran of the former Vietnam and a renegade cop who goes in search and destroys the mission to save his sister from the ruined redwoods. The atrocious film is so cheap and so ugly that Ron Palillo is in third place, yet he has 3 minutes of screen time, and even those are not good. Overall a terrible film, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a bagged and gagged tree are worth a few laughter (involuntary). Followed by an improved sequel.
