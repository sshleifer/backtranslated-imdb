I rented this film thinking it was the sad 1959 version I saw as a child. It was not. I was very disappointed by what I felt was a marginal acting, a poor character development and, above all, the inability to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version ... the "Dog of Flanders" is just a nice "aside" for the film. Get the 1959 version!
