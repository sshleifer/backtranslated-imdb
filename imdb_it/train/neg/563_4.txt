Should every good story be "improved" by adding Broadway music? Apparently those who fail to invent their plots think that classical literature is only there for pillage. I confess that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens has often written things that leave you greatly snubbed, and this was a great example of this ... So obviously, take this serious story and add nauseating music and camp with every character, from the orphaned puppets that jump into the air to the waders and suddenly it's edifying? Argh. Take me a pelvis. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my evaluation come from the casting, which I could compare to that of My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast of which a theatrical version could be proud, but then they must go and have them sing (see the complaint above). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here could actually do it and have mercifully spared us the singer voice of Oliver Reed (sorry if I'm wrong, it's been a while). <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint I have stated. Why embarrass everyone except the real shameless ones by putting stupid songs in a perfectly good story? This has rarely been done with good results. It generally ruins history. He did it with this. The jury is still out if this story is worth saving, but with everything to do with it, it's impossible to say.
