Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and something is missing in her life. He enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and wins. He left for the title of Miss Europe leaving behind his fianc√©. He wins again, but returns home to Andre because he asked him. Once back together, her life becomes banal again, so one night she writes him a ticket and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe. Andre follows it ..... <br /> <br /> This film is a silent film with a track of piano music all the way through. It's also accelerated, so everything seems fast. The limited dialogue was added later and is very bogus. The cast is fine keeping in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes to an end, but the story lasts a little too long. After seeing this, I'm not really sure what the big deal was compared to the appearance of Louise Brooks: she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat. I don't need to watch it again.
