I was really disappointed with this movie. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I loved it. Then I saw Pecker and I loved him. Then I saw Polyester and I really hated it. The only thing I liked about that movie was DIVINA. She / He had a lot of talent. I was really surprised. Overall, I would not recommend this movie ...
