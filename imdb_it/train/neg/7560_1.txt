How this film could lose so many fascinating, complex and mysterious aspects of the original story or the original film is truly remarkable. An incredibly subtle and uninvolving plot, ankle characterization / motivation and a really terrible soundtrack (which replaces tension with wide bands of noise, replacing the arcane musical references of the original due to crashes and digitized roars.) Then there are the references specific to the original that are simply "plastered" above the cracks ... Terrible: in a world in which the Amerikan gormless and brain-dead remedies of The Italian Job (a tear appears), Get Carter (uncontrollable sobs) and Alfie have profaned our screens recently, this takes the proverbial cookie, an execrable absurdity, how come Ellen Burstyn was involved is a marvel ... trash.
