The novelty of listening to Jay Leno that speaks four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formidable police non-aligned script. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen turbocharger prototype (do you think the lover of the Leno machine helped with the plot?). The two protagonists strive, they really do it, but Leno is not an actor and the routine of fish-out of the water of Morita grows fast. The film bears a bit of 80s style, but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills its very long 100 minute running time. Fans of Leno's remarkable comedic talents will feel disappointed; everyone else will be bored.
