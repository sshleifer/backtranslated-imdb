I think this is a horrible produced and directed film. Benicio Del Toro should not work in film production, he should put the accent on his acting and that's it. Steven Soderbergh has lost the idea of ​​the idea of ​​revolution, of the ideals and life of Che Guevara and so on. The camera is horrible, as if someone with 2 days of work experience turned with it, the music is ... I don't know ... is there music in the film ???? I would not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. He's just wasting about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything else ... I can't understand how anyone can judge this movie more than 3 stars. DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER .... DISASTER Do not look please. Save yourself from this "movie" misery
