I saw this boring waste of time in HBO's Comedy Channel, so I thought it was a comedy. But there's absolutely nothing funny here. A good cast is basically wasted on a script that I could have written with my left cheek, after he was beaten senseless by 15th century Inquisition torturers. The first semester is particularly bad, as it contains some of the most boring and useless dialogues I have come across in a while and a zero point zero plot to talk about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves that hit the cold British coast, but that's all. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie that is only made because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or a lot of money around.
