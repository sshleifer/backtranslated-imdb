I had never heard of it before the owner of my local DVD rental shop talked to me about it; being a 1980s horror film with the famous distinction of being banned in the UK, I decided to try it. The film turned out to be a boring, amateur and ugly ride; sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible for half the time, while acting gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /> <br /> What's worse, the film follows the terribly tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident and being sheltered from a dysfunctional family that lives in a remote environment. Soon, one of the girls goes to seek help and is never heard again; another, still in bed, is quickly eliminated (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one who interacts the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a mother who beats the bible (hideous exaggerated cue), her suppressed daughter (and long-suffering) and the strange brother of the latter who occasionally appears the scene to drool over the sleeping guests. <br /> <br /> Often he uses table reminiscences from the mother who hates men (as a means to fill the monotonous, not to mention non-originals, behind-the-scenes) and which inevitably develops in mother-daughter sparring contexts , the film has an ace up its sleeve - the twisted ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the film by the film (either through the lameness of all this like intermittent blood) or the inescapable feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time ...
