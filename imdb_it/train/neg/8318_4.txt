I've already seen fantastic stories, but the premises of this are so incredible that they come very close to being ridiculous. A rich, young boy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and is somehow witness to his surgery and his surgeons' plot to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is a mixture of dialogue between ... saying ... anime? ... maybe and real life where the devoted mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no hint of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a wicked and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that the film is completely lacking in quality - In fact, director Joby Harold does a decent job directing a good team of actors that includes Hayden Christensen on his first major role after taking the Anakin Skywalker costume, the fabulous Jessica Alba and the gifted Lena Olin. Everyone would have deserved a better story.
