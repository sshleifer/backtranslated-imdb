To say that this film stinks would be offensive to skunks. As the other commentator says, this film is offensive to anyone over the age of 7 (it's particularly, incredibly insulting to gays). It's terrible - and not in an "ugly way it's fun" - it's just awful. No, I have to say: THINK! (sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the opening credits to the credits there are just over 10 seconds of this movie which makes it worthwhile to open your eyes. The "plot" is inconsistent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is above the top "look at me I'm fun!" school and so on. The sets are awkwardly set (if at all) and are poorly executed, it's just horrible on all fronts - apart from maybe the music, I don't remember thinking that the music smells (except for the songs). <br /> <br /> To be honest with the creators, they lay their cards on the table quite quickly: the opening credits include the title "Also played by Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor" (since the meteor in question it is never never say anything but making an occasional buzzing noise may have raised Mrs. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: "... and scientists have discovered new facts on the rings around Uranus ". Uranus - "Your anus" geddit? geddit? eh? eh ?? Your anus? Humor is really so cheap. <br /> <br /> It says strange things about the "comedies" of that period when it was perfectly permissible for the hero to deliberately shoot people who died on the street but not to say "sh * t" aloud. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for this movie on sale. I feel robbed.
