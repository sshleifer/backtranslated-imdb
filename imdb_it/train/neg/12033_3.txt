Movies about a small city with an equal number of Mormons and Baptists. The new family moves, cites the overwritten dialogue, mediocre acting, green jelly salad with shredded carrots and every other "Mormon joke" known to man. Anyone outside of Mormon culture will have a hard time bearing this film. Anyone in Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a little laugh here and there. You will be much better looking at Hess' other films (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than trying to sit through it. Acting is mediocre. Jared Hess got his hands on many other quality films like "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both films about this groaner.
