I have seen many movies and rarely would I have ever voted for a "1" movie but this film was beyond all limits. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it is DUMB when the characters hear a noise in the house / forest / school / etc and then screams "hi is anyone there?" - but at least they are credible when they do it .. This film could not even do it well. <br /> <br /> This is a film that will make other B-horror films such as Venom and The Fog resemble award-winning masterpieces of the academy. <br /> <br /> I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this film was a complete waste of time and I write this comment so that everyone else is thinking about watching this movie will think again. IT'S HORRIBLE!
