This film was so ridiculous that I didn't even finish watching it, actually I thought someone had made their own version and renamed it on the movie store DVD. This film made me sick not because it was bloody, but because I wasted 2 50 on it !!!! It looks like my brother and I walked into a house and we made the movie ourselves and we put together the slaughter movie! I'm so right, even the BTK Killer deserves more credit than it wasn't even accurate, I mean the cow's head was obviously made of gaming paste or BUBBLE GUM OMG. WATCH THIS FILM !!!!!!!
