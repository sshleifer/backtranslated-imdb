I saw the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 pounds and House, M.D .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inept by choice, similar to the character of Laurie, but without the bitter spirit that Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, Tucci's "straight boy", the enigmatic doctor Seger, is not developed into a more interesting character, like the fallible "straight boys" Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varma's character, Adrienne Holland, is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor, Cameron, to be a co-incidence. <br /> <br /> Someone at CBS obviously noticed the success of House, MD and told his staff to take it like that, hoping that the mimic would succeed. However, copying a show like House requires the same balance of humor and suspense and Tucci and the company are not up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> I didn't know the show was canceled until I read the comments on IMDb, but it doesn't surprise me.
