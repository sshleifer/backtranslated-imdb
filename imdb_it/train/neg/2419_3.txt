I simply gave this to three because it satisfied what my friends and I hoped would do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thought thinking it would be a zombie movie up there with characters like Romero or Fulci, but what I rented it for was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for fun or a movie to shake your head in embarrassment, try it. This is perfect for junior fans - "Mystery Science Theater", but the only downside is that it is so ugly, it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> I personally think it's a shame to associate it with any other Hollywood title that we can know, because when a film sucks, it has its own genre.
