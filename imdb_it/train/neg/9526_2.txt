When I came back to rent videos for free, I chose this one. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside of the summary already given were these. 1: Someone who had a lot to do with this film had a strange and sick fascination with food, it was coarse and not necessary. 2: There's a kind of soundtrack in the background of the film that seems to be there all the time and from the way I felt for days after seeing this junk I imagine they had something subliminal on the track. Either that or it was just traumatizingly bad or both. Many times during the film it can be said that the writer and director did not have much experience or talent. And don't even ask for acting.
