It happened with Assault on Prescient 13 in 2005, it happened with The Lost Boys in 2008 and now it has happened with another classic from the 80s Wargames ... :( Why, oh why, oh, why does Hollywood never learn? From alone ...! They cannot be redone ...! they suck .... we all hate them ....!. <br /> <br /> those of you who have not seen the original The 1983 version with Matthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, he leases / buys it now .... !! The hardware may seem dated, the special effects are not a new millennium but they still beat these garbage hands .... <br /> <br /> For those of us who lived through the 80s when hacking was sexy, the Internet was something of a mystery and your records came as an 8-inch floppy variety, and now we have the wisdom to avoid this movie as a thermonuclear war ! br /> <br /> Never before has "a good game of chess" seemed like the best option ....
