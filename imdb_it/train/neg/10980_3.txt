A really scary movie. It looks like it was made in the early 1990s by a heterosexual person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, current-seeking people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred way to salvation for gays sad, lonely and crazy by sex. Wow! Who knew? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate buffoon, the bitter and solitary queen, the fag hag, etc.) And the main characters are mediocre, mediocre and Middle Eastern clones of little interest. <br /> <br /> As for the romantic and ideological struggles of the main couple, there is not much to say: we have seen everything before, and done much better.
