This film was made and shown in my hometown. I remember the confusion and the whole clamor over the fact that Molly Ringwald was in town ... <br /> <br /> Storyline ... <br /> <br /> Basically, 20 years after a movie was " posato "rest" without being finished, a group of film students decided to complete it - with disastrous consequences. It would seem that someone does not want the film to be completed. <br /> <br /> The plot is fragile. that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little cheek, but has not had any lumps. The characters are mostly transperant and the little information you get about them doesn't interest you, it seems irrelevant. Kylie's accent as an Australian again and good to see a child with whom I went to school in a leading role. But this does not redeem the film at all. Who knows why the producers thought they would come to Molly Ringwald. of the nature of the film (it is a sort of homage to the films of the a nni '80 / bad horror movies) but in reality an Australian actor would have behaved well. <br /> <br /> As far as the cast is concerned the acting seemed constipated. Some of these guys (in particular the two main films - they played "director" and "producer") seemed to be trying to act. It's never a good look. Also, the shots had a rough feeling about them. Up above maybe? Just not as smooth as you are used to. <br /> <br /> The killer. Lord. Could it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors and a couple of rough scenes. I liked the movie, but it wasn't great. He went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less. Perhaps if they reinforced the script it would have been better. They killed a lot of characters - but no real build-up has been supplanted. Perhaps if they killed fewer people and actually concentrated in a frightening atmosphere it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy and the elements were fun. Or so incredible they were fun. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
