It is very sad that Lucian Pintilie does not stop making films. Every time they get worse. Niki and Flo (2003) is a depressing stab at the camera. It is unfortunate that from the many films that are made every year in Romania, the worst of them are sent abroad (eg Chicago International Film Festival). This film without plot, acting or screenplay is a waste of time and money. Score: 0.02 out of 10.
