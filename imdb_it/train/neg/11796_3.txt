Anything else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. However, don't rent it and definitely DON'T buy it. It would be a big mistake. I saw this on TV and found myself laughing in some places. I didn't laugh for long and I didn't laugh much. However, there were jokes and subtle comments that I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely fun "hood" movie, then look at Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional film (something this film tries to watch) look at something like the dreams of a basket or Jason's Lyric. If you're looking for a good black booty, watch a porn movie by Dominique Simone, because the nudity in this film is almost non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it. You will be slightly amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
