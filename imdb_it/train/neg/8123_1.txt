(spoiler) Wow, this is bad. I did a double lap while watching an old episode of Star Trek the other day - it was the one where everyone became infected with that space sickness and then went a little crazy - and there was Stewart Moss, aka the unlikely hero of It Lives by night! He played the first infected crew member, who dies from the terminal depression. All I could think was that he had watched his movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. This film is full of really unlikely people. There is no salvific character in the film, not one. It is very difficult to feel bad that Dr. Beck has turned into a bat (or anything that has actually turned into), because you don't like it. And you don't like its shrill, bony wife or disgusting sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why should you invest time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to worry about caring for them. Not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look as if they had filmed the film through urine, and the five-cent special effects, many of which looked like pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of flying bats. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K, but down there in the lower ranks, for sure.
