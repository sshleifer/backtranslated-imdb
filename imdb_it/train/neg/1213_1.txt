I can't believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger were involved in this piece of trash! The script is so badly written and the director is so weak (both of the same person) that it is difficult to find more characters at one dimension in a film. The dialogues are so lame that this so-called thriller made fun of the few fools who entered the theater. The setup is complicated, inviting you to believe that you'll see a chilling thriller and suddenly turn into the most stupid persecution movie. The character of Bassinger is so stupid, that he actually stops to cry out to God "Where are you!" so people after you can follow, and then make a loss !!!! And then apparently she entered the smallest forest in the world, I mean, she runs everywhere and the murderers never lose it, and that happens in the middle of the night. It really amazes me, is that the best Hollywood writers can find out they spend millions to produce it.
