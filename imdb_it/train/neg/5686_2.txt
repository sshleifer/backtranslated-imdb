Hello. this is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went to the trouble of telling everyone that this is literally the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. I feel like the film has been made with care, which will give me some understanding due to budget constraints to do it. I felt like I was watching a bad remake of the movie saw. That I can agree, since it is also very graphic, but, I liked the cinematographic saw. <br /> <br /> The scene in which he takes the hammer to the victim's head tied in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well, actually, it was probably around 5 minutes, but still. I want to note that I like some horror films and I give credit if they are good. this director is boiled, and his group of people used to make this film should think about it before creating another similar to this one. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO ENJOY TO WATCH BEATIN ANIMALS FOR DEATH, MAKE IT ROTATE, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN, AS WELL AND A SCENE OF FIVE MINUTES OF SOMEONE TO MAKE A HEAD IN A HAMMER so you'll like this movie, otherwise the horror, go with a movie with a higher budget, such as saw. I can't believe people actually make movies like this. anyway i'm sorry for whoever loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.
