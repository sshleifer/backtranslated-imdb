This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt bad looking at it. Up to this point, the other episodes had at least one positive aspect. The first part was full of suspense and bloody. The second part was out of rhythm and fun. The third part was interesting with great effects. The fourth part had great music, good special effects and a new fun Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a much prettier blonde, returned with her boyfriend Dan from Part 4. Partly, this alleged episode of Elm Street turns into soap by day. The new characters look tough, and even the sweet one Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and doesn't seem to be so creepy. His one-liners seem out of place and different, where, as in Part 4, they could be quite funny. The story of Leslie Bohem is never taken off and Stephen Hopkins' direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this film is ridiculous and unrealistic. He is also confused and rather stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
