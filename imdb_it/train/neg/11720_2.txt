I read in the papers that W.Snipes was broke, so it's no wonder he took part in low-budget projects like The Contractor. It's just the next action star to join a growing club: the penniless action stars of the 1990s (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he is the protagonist in a low-cost action movie shot in Bulgaria (we should believe that the place is London, as if only a complete moron bought it) hired by the government again to do a wet job - after the government wants to get rid of him - the good guy leaves after killing bad guys (was it a spoiler? I guess not!) Bennett) exceeds all the other cast actors !!! A star is more like a star for her sweet eyes Lena Headey, she is 2 stars. Only for Snipes fans, everyone else: avoid!
