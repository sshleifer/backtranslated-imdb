This is one of those horrible male movies that could not have played near a theater. The women run around dressed in little-dressed "bunny" clothes, an extremely fat woman is the weight of many insignificant jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an extravagant son (Jim Hanks, who is obviously brother of Tom), that the man wants to "fuck". Hanks is actually something good, but this movie is not going anywhere and it doesn't make sense. One must ask why it was even created? However, due to Hank's performance and some funny moments (but not more than a few), he received a stellar "2" on 10. I think I was kind, though.
