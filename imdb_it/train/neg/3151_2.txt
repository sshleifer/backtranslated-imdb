"It had to be you" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This photo is about Charlie Hudson, a former police officer who became an author. When Charlie's boyfriend leaves the city he is blocked by all the marriage plans. He spends a week in a luxury hotel and meets Anna Penn, a teacher who is getting married. The two quickly became friends and began to plan their separate marriages together. This is when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie takes away every romantic comedy ever made and awaits you just for the end of the film, so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge offer truly mediocre performances that make this film even more compelling to watch.
