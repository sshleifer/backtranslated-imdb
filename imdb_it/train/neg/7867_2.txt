Ok, I tried and I tried, but I STILL DON'T GET this Guy Maddin thing. Tales From the Gimli Hospital left me cold, that movie about the inhabitants of the Austrian village and the one about the Ice Nymph were beautiful to look at but were missing in the history department ... and this nudist film about abortion and hockey is simply boring. I'm glad that Maddin has an appreciation for the silent film, but I don't like his films for the same reason that I don't like Quentin Tarantino's films: they are empty tributes to better, more imaginative films - films that have advanced the form of art or broken new ground - and they are all style and no substance. No odd number of jumps and viewing angles can hide the fact that Maddin is a skilled aspirant of David Lynch, although he has an advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write embarrassing dialogues, because most of his films are based on captions. The bottom line is that Maddin's schtick is a clever movie creation for aspiring film majors.
