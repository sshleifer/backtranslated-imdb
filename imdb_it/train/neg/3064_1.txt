The original "Vanishing Point" was a great film. Subtle motifs, characters that seemed real and spontaneous. The remake was terrible. Preaches, openly obvious; missed the point about why the original was a classic. The black charger was nice, but even that couldn't save this movie. Why stay with a white challenger? I didn't think that was the best choice in '71. Some parts of the film were unintentionally funny. Like when Vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his "Dream Quest". His Indian friend was standing next to him. Vigo only wore his white briefs. I'm sorry, it seemed like nonsense, as he watched the view in his Fruit of the Looms. Another scene was eventually - after the explosive incident in the bulldosers - the announcer said the impact was timed at 180 mph. He then says that the policemen said his remains were not found because it was vaporized, but some people believe that he was saved and hidden by friends in the crowd. Then show him rolling out of the car at 180 mph! First of all, you couldn't open the car door at 180 mph. Second, the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds. with nobody to guide him. He would have promptly rolled about 30 times. Thirdly, if I hit the pavement at 180 mph, it would end up in various squishy pieces. Never mind, we finally see him standing with his daughter. All in all, a film that would have insulted anyone's intelligence.
