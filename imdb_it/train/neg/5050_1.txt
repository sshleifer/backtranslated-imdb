Oh my God, this was the worst reunion movie I've ever seen. (This is saying a lot). I'm ashamed to look. <br /> <br /> What happened in the script meetings? "Ooooooh, I know! Let's make two muffins stud fall madly in love with the most annoying character-from-cousin-Oliver." "Yes, it will be beautiful!" <br /> <br /> Even for sitcoms, this has been the most plausible plot since Ron Popeil began to spray bald men.
