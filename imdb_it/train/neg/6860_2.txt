beyond the fact that crazy people exist and there are religious madmen out there. <br /> <br /> The characters are almost meaningless most of the time. <br /> <br /> The film has no real beginning, middle or end, nor has it been much explained. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man, with the unlikely name of Hazel Motes, who seems to be returning from a period of service in the army. <br /> <br /> Approaches to a two-storey house in extreme ruin, with barred windows. He goes home, walks around and eventually writes a ticket he leaves there. This scene does not lead to anything and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is never explained exactly who this house is, or where people went, but we are given the impression of Hazel probably lived there at once. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Because - we don't know. Once he arrives in this city, he writes a name and an address he sees on a bathroom wall, and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly fat prostitute. He sees her for a while and then apparently doesn't see her anymore. Like everything else in this film, it comes to nothing and serves no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man named Enoch, tries to make friends with him, but Hazel is not really interested, even if they keep crossing. <br /> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you can. One of his habits is going to the zoo and standing in front of the cage where the chimpanzees are and talking in an offensive way. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enoch behaves like him, or why Hazel behaves as he does, apart from the fact that Hazel had an overdose of frightening and fundamentalist old age through her grandfather. <br /> <br /> Enoch later becomes fascinated by a man who dresses in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorilla dressed by him and then runs into it. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is a rather narrow wound and appears to be in a constant borderline anger, does some street preaching. I had the impression that he was trying to free himself from the falsity of the religion that had been exercised in him. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with a preacher and his daughter, even though their interactions never really make any particular point, and there is no plot line. <br /> <br /> Eventually Hazel succumbs to complete religious fervor and begins to damn herself. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange film. Interesting for its strangeness, but other than that it has absolutely nothing to do. <br /> <br /> The cast does an exceptional job, but this film fails to provide either a point of view or a plot. <Br /> <br /> The film also has characters that run around the word N from time to time without any connection to the rest of the dialog. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
