Watching The Tenants was an interesting experience for me. It's the first movie I've ever seen where I did at speed in parts of the action (not), and normally I can watch anything from swollen action films to Serbian-Croatian India and find them fascinating. <br /> <br /> The Tenants is frustratingly lazy and too orchestrated. One of the main problems of the script is that there is a very realistic dialogue of characters, apart from the scenes in which the characters "collide" in a very structured environment (to make this work, the film needs to feel more conceptual, which not). This leads to a lack of realistic development of the characters; all seem two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worst is the character of Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very nasty. At one point, I even interrupted the film because I was so annoyed by the aggressive, violent and monotonous delivery of the character, by the lack of any other level of personality besides that of the reactionary "on" switch (which becomes really predictable after a while ') and desperately wanted to have some salvific qualities. However, one of the reasons for this vase could be the nebulous time of the film (presumably the '70s, it feels and seems earlier). Had he been more secure in the 1970s, his character would have seemed more understandable. <br /> <br /> Even the lighting of the film was embarrassing. Throughout the journey, the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty, jazz-infused atmosphere that didn't come out, largely because the set was too bright. <br /> <br /> The Tenants, in my opinion, is an incredible film. It does not represent real people or offers any interesting way of thinking about the race, identity or life of a writer, be it white or black. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I came to the conclusion that this project needed David Lynch; his disturbing, clastrophobic and obsessive appearance would have raised both the actors and the script in something truly remarkable.
