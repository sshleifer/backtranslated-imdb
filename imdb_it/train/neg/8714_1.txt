I couldn't stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But it doesn't matter, it's a lot of fun! In this film, you don't need to pay attention to anything! The acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the stick holding the head of the T-Rex for a moment.) The birds of prey are the same as the Carnosaurus 2, the T-Rex is the same, but ... some scenes his head looks a little stuffed and looks like a kind of project failure from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, actually I talk about fast editing, they modified it so fast, so that we can't see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! until late, I'm rubber! Well, only the interesting things here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. <br /> <br /> What can I say ... don't rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more fun!
