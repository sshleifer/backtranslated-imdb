In the Fiji Islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests for an opening party of its complex consisting of hotels and zoos with the aim of finding partners for its discoveries. When a group of thieves from a small college puts a virus in the security system to participate in a treasure hunt, the biggest attractions of the zoo ?? sabretoothes from the prehistoric era developed from the DNA found in fossils ?? escape, kill the hosts and the guards for pleasure. <br /> <br /> The incredibly lame and cheap "Attack of the Sabretooth" is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. The characters are horrible and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park scam with a bad collection of clich√©s. Basically all lines and situations are scarce and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabroti are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ataque do Dente de Saber" ("The Sabretooth Attack")
