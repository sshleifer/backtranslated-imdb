Was this film based on real facts? I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> We will see what appears to be a large number of armed policemen who empty an equal amount of guns at 2 men who have only their armored torso. This is a great idea; aim at armor! ... I'm sorry, but how about those big unmissable heads or their legs to cry hard. Or were there invisible tanks that protected them? were they from Crypton? Was I missing something here? <br /> <br /> This film started quite well but after 20 minutes of shooting it really takes a trivia shift. <br /> <br /> And the style of this documentary didn't work for me either, but this is just something nice or not. <br /> <br /> Incredibly incredible stuff that makes it difficult to see until the end. <br /> 3/10 for the fine modification.
