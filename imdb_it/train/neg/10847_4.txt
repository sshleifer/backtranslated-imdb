The cut director's version, which was the one I saw, was very long for this type of film. Almost two hours are too long. If you have the choice, choose the cut of the non-directors. <br /> <br /> The main plot is almost completely absent, the film consists of the main part of several murder scenes, which are linked but the feeling is that they are shown only to fill the film with splatterian violence. The connection is not revealed until the second part and the lack of context bored me long before I was there. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie it doesn't work. You never get the required feeling for the characters due to mediocre acting and general disposition (the character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This strong side of images is in the splatter part.
