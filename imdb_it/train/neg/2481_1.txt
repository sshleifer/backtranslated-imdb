I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before, but judging by this effort to write and direct, he had to keep his day job as a merchant's actor. Like many others here, I don't know how to classify this film, it wasn't scary or spooky, so it can't be called a horror, the plot was so subtle that it couldn't be a drama, there was no suspense so it can't be a thriller, it's just a bad movie that you should only see if you were a fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this film used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they were reading something that wasn't there. Like the witch of Blair, people got scared because people thought they had to be scared and buy themselves into some owl that was terrifying. This film actually started well with the family "meeting" the locals after hitting a deer. It seemed to be a liberation of modern times, but then for the next 45 minutes, (well over half of the film), nothing happened, the family sang their vacation home which was very beautiful and dandy but not the least fun. It was obvious that the locals would be involved in some way at some point, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to create suspense in a movie. In the end, when something happens, it is not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was just touched), and all this time Wendigo's spirit seems to track down the seemingly awkward shooter with 3rd class special effects. The film is called Wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it clearly, the film ends up confused and leaves you very dissatisfied, I would have saved myself 15 minutes early but I wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. It was not so.
