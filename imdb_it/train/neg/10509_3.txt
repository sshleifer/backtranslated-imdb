Raised from the sky, a band of naked and horny female angels (with large plastic tusks) have settled in a ghostly forest where they feed on unfortunate souls who should roam. Is it not long before a group of traveling friends is falling victim to bloodthirsty girls ?? A low-cost independent horror film made in the United Kingdom, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and downloads it on the plate with some of the worst effects, acting and directing I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Director Johannes Roberts shows occasional touches behind the camera ?? the scenes in the disappointed house are rather tense and there are some cleverly managed "shock" moments - but for the most part the film is technically amateur. Throw some really horrible performances of the horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a real bad movie in your hands. <br /> <br /> A little fun can come from the sheer scarcity of the film, and there is a lot of female nudity for the guys to savor, but most will find this task challenging to sit.
