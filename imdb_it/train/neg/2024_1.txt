Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this bewildering excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shine in shiny red dresses. A competitor is given the start of a sentence, for example "Which team lost ...". with three choices, A, B or C, each of which completes the sentence. The competitor has three possibilities to answer one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, to his most hateful annoyance - asks the competitor if he wants to "close the answer" and when the competitor says yes, he chooses a "dancer", to whom he shouts "Show me the money!" He opens a parchment that has an amount, and if his answer is correct, he adds that sum to his winnings; if it is wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So ​​theoretically, it is possible for a competitor in this depressing debacle to end up with Shatner money.) There is also a "Killer Card" and if the competitor chooses the girl who has that base roll, but answered correctly, nothing happens. . If it has responded badly, the game enters Sudden Death and must answer another question. If you are wrong, leave with nothing. <br /> <br /> Before going to the commercials, Shatner screams, "we dance" and Shatner, the competitor and the twelve dancers shake the loot. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the women "one last dance" and everyone shakes him again. <br /> <br /> Give this show up to 6 episodes, at which time I hope this pathetic excuse for a game will show the door. (It could have been worse - they could somehow bribe Cuba Gooding Jr as host, although I bet it's a better dancer than "Shat", as they call it these days.) <br /> <br /> 7/08 : Guess what - I was wrong! It lasted only for 5 episodes. There is hope for the world.
