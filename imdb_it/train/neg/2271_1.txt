Someone could probably make a great documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictional version simply manages to empty out anything authentic and interesting from the junk TV phenomenon. There are dozens of notoriously bad films (eg "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this depressing, wasted film waste. <br /> <br /> Really, why not a documentary on the Jerry Springer Show, which would begin to answer some of the real questions like: who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the mayor of Cincinatti find you here? <br /> <br /> A good line: during a session of "orientation" for the guests: "People, I can't stress enough: NO WEAPONS!"
