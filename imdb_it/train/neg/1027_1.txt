Normally, I have a lot better to do with my time than writing reviews but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour registering with IMDb just to get my chest out. <br /> <br /> You would think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable bet ... well, this movie was just terrible. It is almost impossible to "suspend disbelief"; I tried, really, I wanted to enjoy it, but Justin Timberlake wouldn't let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should stick to the music, what a terrible sight - NO presence as an actor, NO character. I can't blame everything on Justin: The film also boasts a terrible storyline and a poorly planned editing; it is definitely an "F". <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I have to ask myself what really motivates the actors. I mean, surely Morgan actually read the script before taking the part. Didn't see how scarce it was? What then could motivate him to take the part? Money? Of course, acting sometimes is more about who you are seen than about the serious development of quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; he has a lot more time on the screen than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to come to terms with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience says, "What the hell is going on here? Do you expect me to believe this shit?" <br /> <br /> In short, apart from Justin, a great lineup performed - very disappointing.
