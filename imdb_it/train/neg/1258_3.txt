Attention: Spoilers Galore! <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, making this film sui generis, is just as sensible as the remake of Psycho - oh right, an idiot has already done it - my case is resting. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a chimpanzee who blunder a simulation, proving that he is not so smart from the start. Marky Mark appears in the shot without his characteristic underpants showing, then he is rejected by a simple woman who prefers the touch of a chimpanzee. <br /> <br /> The landmark of the space station that orbits around Saturn for no apparent reason, inside of a ship full of genetic experiments on monkeys. Do we have to travel 1.300 million kilometers to Saturn to conduct these experiments? The special effects team decrees it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee is lost in that staple of science fiction cinema from the 1960s: Time Warp. Marky then demonstrates the ineptitude of space station security by stealing a pod without anyone noticing, while at the same time demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep space rescue mission in an endless hole for a testable chimp, with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies. <br /> <br /> Before anyone can say "aimless makeover" Marky surfed the wormhole, crashed into an alien planet, removed his helmet without thinking about the lethality of the atmosphere and being chased through a stage that looks almost like a lush rainforest, if it weren't for the kliegs that light up the plastic trees. <br /> <br /> Surprise! It is APES that is chasing - or at least, * it would have been a surprise if no one had seen Planet Of The Apes. Thirty-three years ago. <br /> <br /> As Marky Mark did not show his bibs, lower his pants, or tear his stupid white rap to pieces, he is without character. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth that were inserted crooked contributed immensely to establish * his * lack of character. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimpanzee activist), at a loss without a Shakespearean script, did a great job overcoming both Marky and Clarke as Most Cutout. Paul Giamatti, the orangutan slave trader, has secured the role of klutz's comic and interspecies token relief. Although I became quite obsessive in listening to word games related to this film, a headline in the first capture captured the essence of this "Re-imagining" by Planet Of The Apes: "The Apes Of Roth". While everyone else slaughtered to appear as extras from One Million Years BC or Greystoke, Tim Roth, like Chimpanzee Thade, chews up huge amounts of landscapes and throws kaka in a shining way. As funny as his portrait of the psychotic Thade was, his character lacked a behavioral arc: Thade is crazy when we meet him for the first time ... and is practically on the same level of madness at the end of the film. The original POTA (1968) was characterized by a main character, Taylor from Charlton Heston, who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left the earth for space with no regrets - yet, as the film progressed, Taylor unwittingly found himself stuck in a battle to prove the value of humanity - as their only champion! The original film was ultimately a story of humiliation, not of salvation: when Taylor discovers the Statue of Liberty, he is forced to realize that his species has NOT prevailed. Is there something cerebral or ironic about Marky Mark's Lion? Or Roth's Thade? No, but there's a lot to run. <br /> <br /> Slogans scream: Take Back The Planet. But it is the planet of APE. In this film, humans and monkeys have crashed here together, humans have degenerated into cavephaople, allowing monkeys to acquire speeches and sensual body armor; the monkeys deserved to inherit the planet! Marky Mark arrives, in true anthropocentric arrogance, assuming that humans MUST be predatory predators, simply because they are there. "Taking it back" is as ridiculous as the monkeys that land here in 2001, complaining, "A planet where men evolved from APES ?? !!" and then causing problems with their exaggerated and hairy anus. <br /> <br /> Heston was signed in 1968 by POTA because he had established his non-conformist reputation: he was Ben-Hur, Michelangelo, Moses! Deceiving him as a dumb and tenacious animal in an alien society means surprising the public's expectations: how crazy must a world be in which our man Charlton cannot impose respect? Marky Mark at the moment has only established that he has tight panties. <br /> <br /> Although Heston has been consistently denigrated by the monkey council, he has dominated the screen with his charisma and his astonishing exaggeration. When Marky Mark tries to instill fervor in the Mongoloid humans, it is as if that unpopular boy at school was suddenly transformed into a classroom monitor, telling you to stop drawing penises on the board and throwing a shoe at him. Burton tries to elevate Marky to the icon of humanity, but it comes out as a deviant chitter. In the original film, monkeys consider Taylor deviant, yet it was, for the public and monkeys alike, an icon of humanity. It was an irony again. <br /> <br /> It was right that a man who elevated the scene - chewing on an acting technique - Heston - should play the father of the first film in this film, Thaddeus Roth. As Roth's dad, Charlton utters his own immortal lines, this time he turned against the HUMANS: "Damn them! Damn them all in hell!" <br /> <br /> The movie becomes stupid and more stupid towards the end. While Thaddeus is giving Marky a heart-pounding lesson, a capsule descends from above with Marky's chimp. We teach these monkeys to evolution. "First, they are not monkeys, monkey! Secondly, it was the genetic manipulations and the stupid plot constructions that brought monkeys to this point, not evolution. you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the hidden lasergun is called misanthropy, not evolution. <br /> <br /> Giving away the end of the twist would do nothing but confuse the spectators by making them believe that the role of mezzo-nekkid d the Estella Warren were actually an integral part of the plot (still be my pants). <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter that it was the last unbearable hope of humanity; in the end, the police monkeys take Marky away to the Plot Point prison where he last heard howling, "It's a madhouse! A HIDDEN !! ... '
