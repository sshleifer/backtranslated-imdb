This movie is terrible. Not a quality for this film. You would think that blood would be good but it sucks. The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst I've ever seen. This film was obviously shot on a video camera and probably costs about $ 500. If you want to see a good Zombi movie, look at Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead. If you want to see a good cheap movie on Zombie movie videos like this, it's better than watching Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unwatchable and useless. You've been warned I have nothing else to say about this stupid movie.
