THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> While searching for a (literal) ) ghost town in the middle of nowhere, a young reporter (Emmy Smith) collects a grizzled hitchhiker (Joseph Haggerty) who tells her two stories involving carnivorous zombies known to infest the area. <br /> <br /> A ABSOLUTE waste of time, limping from the start with Haggerty's painfully amateur performance in a key role. Worse still, the two stories that make up most of the running time are absolutely routine, compounded by indifferent performances and a lackluster driving by Brad Sykes, previously head of CAMP BLOOD (1999). This is not a 'funny' movie in the sense that Ed Wood's films are 'funny' (he, at least, believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts, despite the lack of talent); Sykes's home-made films are, in effect, aggravating, boring and almost completely devoid of any saving virtue, and most viewers will rightly feel angry and cheated by such unimaginative and ill-conceived stuff. The 3-D format is completely wasted here.
