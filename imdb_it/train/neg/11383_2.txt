This is really a bad "B" movie. It is dull and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic routine of "making in show business", is almost non-existent. In fact, the film is just an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular musical groups of 1942, including the Mills brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about the standard three minutes, with the exception of the Mills Brothers, who for some reason deserved two numbers. Ann Miller doesn't dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and has little to do but smash her stuff in the middle of a flurry of patriotic propaganda. <br /> <br /> The most interesting moment of the film, in my opinion, occurred in the segment of Duke Ellington. The band seems to be playing on a train, standing in awkward positions. (In the deep south, at the moment, the band was segregated in rail cars when traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen near Duke, and Harry Carney could also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeter / violinist Ray Nance rushes down the corridor towards the camera and makes an "uncle Tom", tormenting his eyes and moving his head like Willy Best did in many films. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is really sad. Some movies are better without being seen.
