Don't waste time or money with this. The half-decent cast could make you think that this teen-thriller, while hardly going to beat any record, could easily entertain for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It won't. <br /> <br /> It will not make you frighten, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. It will leave you wondering why this film has ever finished production. Yes, he is really that poor.
