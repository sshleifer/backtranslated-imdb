Despite his stereotypes, the cast with virtually no name and obviously a low budget, I thought this film was good; much better than I expected. At first I was skeptical: the idea of ​​a computer virus that could infect people seemed a bit ridiculous. But in the end, I thought the film handled the concept well (although some scenes were a bit cliché). <br /> <br /> The cast was pretty good, and the two protagonists seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn't help but think, though, that Janine Turner is a bit like Geena Davis. Maybe it's just his face or the makeup, the hair and the clothes he had in this movie, but he kept tormenting me all the time. <br /> <br /> Even if it's not a "must" or a great movie of any level, "Fatal Error" is a funny movie that will keep you hooked to the end.
