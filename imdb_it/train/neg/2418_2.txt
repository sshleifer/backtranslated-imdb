The first mistake you make in naming a film is to use "the living dead" without really having a budget for real FX zombies. Of course, this was a hit of low budget zombies - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It wasn't really bad considering the above, and presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you're going to get an "R" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots of the girls being attacked. Women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> And, I'm staying out of Oakland. There was a large number of shootings going on and no cops in sight!
