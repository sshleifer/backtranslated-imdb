Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) transforms lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into a star singer during the night. Ester's star rises as John goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After about two hours, John does the red-convertible-160-MPH-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway self-destructive thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen". Barbra Streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an emerging star, when she is * already * a star. The first time he appears, singing in a dead-end bar, he looks like an established star singer who is sleeping for the night, not like a stranger in trouble trying to launch his singing career. She is too confident, too professional. His apartment looks like a page of "Apartment Living", not a hole in the wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson manages the egocentric, out of the - Controls the role of the rock star as ... well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. The direction is warm, the plot is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not acting, or bad direction, or slow story. It's the hair! After watching Kristofferson and Streisand's horrible 70s hairstyles for 2 hours or more, your eyes hurt.
