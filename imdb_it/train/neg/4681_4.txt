We laughed out loud. This script is so incredible that you either zap to CNN or go to sleep. <br /> <br /> My father had been a sea captain for 30 years, he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer, he once claimed control over the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey a day and (sorry) s ** t on his desk. Obviously it wasn't a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. Giving a drill at that time is just a Hollywood script. When a captain is placed under arrest, he is under arrest, take all his keys and open the safe where the weapons are kept. This is stored in a well-monitored room within minutes. He can't escape, it's just like in prison. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that my father also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman made him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever. My father cleaned up all the mess that the dog did wherever he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars for which this film is credited, all the rest is tori ** t. <br /> <br /> When we know that 23 people were still living on the Koersk, this movie has an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
