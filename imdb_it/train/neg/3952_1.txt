Return of the Boogyman is a terrible film that doesn't sound like a movie, it sounds like an episode of a television sitcom when they show up on previous episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a movie. <br /> <br /> The Mutch movie is a constant and annoying flashback to the first film. The same movie over and over again. How boring this is. <br /> <br /> The film is really about a psychic woman who has visions of the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie that I don't want to see the same scenes over and over again and I don't know who would do it. The whole movie seems to have been quickly created to make some money and that's it.
