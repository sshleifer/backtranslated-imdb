Stephen Feinberg, who played the Proctologist and was one of the film's screenwriters, disappeared in early 2006. I met Steve in Portland in 1993, it was a year later, when he told me he had been a writer in Hollywood years ago, working mainly on TV promotions. He asked me not to see "Tunnel Vision", but it was too late, I had already seen it! Actually I had seen it years before when it was released. At the time I didn't think it was a bad movie. However, seeing him as an adult my opinion was a little different. Yes it is a bit childish and old-fashioned. Steve admitted that it wasn't a great film. Having said that he was only a little proud of the 'The Proctologist' design.
