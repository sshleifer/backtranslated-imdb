"Do not Drink the Water" is an incredibly ugly film. It is based on a 1966 Broadway comedy by Woody Allen. He is played by Jackie Gleason, the comic genius behind "The Honeymooners". Director Howard Morris has appeared in several Mel Brooks comedies (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and left a mark on the animation (the characters he expressed include Gopher from "Pooh", Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey ) What went wrong? <br /> <br /> I think the problem is that the premise takes place too seriously to work effectively. Allen's original screenplay was ironic, which is why it worked on Broadway and the 1994 remake of Allen. R.S. Allen and Harvey Bullock beat the premise until they die and make too many changes from the original game. Making Gleason's wife an airhead in this version when she was a stubborn woman in the original is just an example of why this doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Acting is not much better. Gleason does the best he can with the material, but he can't save it. Gleason was a comic genius, but also a good actor, as he showed in "The Hustler" and "Soldier in the Rain". His abrasive personality could have worked here, but the lousy script doesn't even give him a chance. Sin. Estelle Parsons Airhead's wife will drive you crazy after 20 minutes. See how long it will take to make you want to strangle her. This is also a shame because he is also a good actress, having played two outstanding performances in "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Rachel, Rachel". None of the other actors behaves particularly well. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen hated this film so much that he made the film in 1994 with himself and Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson) in the main roles. They manage to hit all the right notes and the film itself is a comic masterpiece. Finally it's on video after a long battle for rights. Go out and find that version. The whole of the 1969 original is good to clear uninvited guests who do not stop at their welcome. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * on 4 stars
