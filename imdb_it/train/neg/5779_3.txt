I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was it? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and funny. When I saw a name of this title and genre I thought great, this could be really good ... some parody for coupons or other gore movies ... but .. then I read a preview and thought it could still be good ... but it was not ... <br /> <br /> my opinion: if like the films they look a bit like a documentary, with a bit of comedy try some of Moore's movies or the Alien autopsy, I'm really for something. this was empty <br /> <br /> and you put a comedy to the title ... no comment ... really bad joke
