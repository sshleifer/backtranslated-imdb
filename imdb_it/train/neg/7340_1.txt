Hit it! This is the worst SRK movie and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I didn't like the novel, but this film made things worse! Very bad music, even worse actors (apart from SRK, of course, even if he can't save the film), and it doesn't make much sense. The director makes everything look very confused, God knows why ... Maybe it's because he's trying to make everything look very surreal and yet credible. Well, it doesn't handle either. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a few hours to spare, don't watch this movie, please! (Saying this for your well-being!) Keep looking, you'll find something else to look at!
