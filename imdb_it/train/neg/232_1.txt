This was supposed to be one of the worst movies ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and everyone starts clapping ... then in Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the floor that seemed to be examining the pavement plot. Andie's acting is so bad in this movie: I can't connect with them or feel love for each other. The other 2 women were still very good and foreshadowed Andie. However this was such a campy movie. I usually like this kind of movie but I couldn't get into this movie. Too many unlikely situations and once again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Plus, she's all gums. Lancome must wear makeup with a spatula because it is fascinating in commericals.
