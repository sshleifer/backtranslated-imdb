First, I warn you that I saw this movie on TV and with the English nickname, which may have ruined the atmosphere. However, I will evaluate what I have seen and hope that it will take people away from that version. I found this film atrociously boring. The whole atmosphere of the film is lost by dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst sin of the film in my book is to be slow, except when the film is about philosophy. I have not seen any profound philosophical meaning in this film. Maybe I missed something, but I have to say it like I see it. I rated it a "1". What can I say, tastes oriented in the United States, perhaps.
