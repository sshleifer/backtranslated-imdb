I watched this movie after having so many problems downloading it through rapidshare. And I must say he didn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> Parinda was so publicized that I couldn't wait to see it. <br /> <br /> Parinda is one of those films that fail to meet the standards set by other good Indian filmmakers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know that the story itself was not original, it was freely inspired by the classic "On the Waterfront". Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he came from America. The director lacked quality many times, except for some intermediate scenes. <br /> <br /> Giving this script to some of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra and I am 100 Surely, they will make a stunning film. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying Parinda was bad. It wasn't good enough.
