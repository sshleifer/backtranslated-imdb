These reviews that claim this film are so bad that they go well with it. This film does not have the malice of the guilty pleasure of Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli. Those films were funny in their terrible reality, but this pile of dinosaur dung is so terrible that it's painful. I haven't felt much pain watching a bad movie since I saw Baby Geniuses and Superbabies. Before starting the review let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million dollar bust The New Line Cinema has refused to enter theaters. They reduce losses by sending them directly to the video, making it the most expensive straight-to-video film in decades. Whoopi joined this disaster after a huge paycheck. <br /> <br /> Plot: a dinosaur of millionaire clones capable of launching missiles into the sun that would kill humanity and launch another ice age. A policeman named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly collaborate to stop him after the death of a dinosaur friend. <br /> <br /> The plot is given to you at the beginning of the film that steals the film of all its mystery. So you have to face the fact that this movie is actually pretty horrible. Whoopi seems agitated and is trying to tinker with his performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is annoying and his clumsy behavior disappears after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hit people with tails (in case of accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad, but Theodore Rex needs a backstory: the worst movie in Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Don't let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be fun. I didn't see it when I saw this movie. All I saw was a railroad disaster written by people who must have had some admiration for the Howard The Duck movie. Humor is at that level and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's innate cousin. Completely painful from start to finish.
