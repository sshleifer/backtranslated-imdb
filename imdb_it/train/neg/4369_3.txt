*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Juggernaut is a "thriller" produced in the United States by First National. Karloff is Dr. Sartorius who must leave his research because his funds have dried up. Karloff is forced to retire in France and start a medical practice. It is proposed by a conniving woman who wants to get rid of her much older husband. He knows that Karloff needs money. <br /> <br /> Karloff accepts the proposal and soon becomes her husband's personal physician. All the while, his wife is jumping around the city with the local not good playboy. Karloff eventually injects the old geyser with poison and takes off. However, his son (from another marriage) arrives a few days before the murder and discovers that the will has been changed. When he pours the beans to his wife, he becomes mad and even bites his son's hand. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Karloff's nurse misplaced the hypoglycemia Karloff had used to kill the old man. When Karloff discovers he doesn't receive money, he asks his wife to poison his son. The nurse suspects Karloff and finds the missing IP. The analysis shows poison, but not entirely timed since Karloff kidnaps the nurse. <br /> <br /> Long story short, the nurse flees, picks up the police and manages to save the son who is being injected with Karloff. Karloff instead injects himself and dies. <br /> <br /> This film has some positive points. Karloff is possessed and plays the kind of crazy doctor he did on The Devil Commands and on The Man Who Lived Again. It is strange, however, to see him walking stiff and slightly bent. We never find out why he walks like this. I suspect the director thought it made him more sinister. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the 2-stroke wife does something terrible. You have a French accent. Even if she behaves badly, you can still hate her (or maybe you hate her because of her acting ...). <br /> <br /> A little below average for a Karloff vehicle. If you buy the copy of the Sinister Cinema VHS, the sound is a bit discontinuous.
