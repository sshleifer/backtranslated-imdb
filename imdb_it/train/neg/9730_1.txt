Now, I took this film because there was Brad Dourif. He's an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything ... except this movie. And I think it was just because he realized how stupid this movie was, and he didn't care about a good performance. This film is an unintended comedy. Some of the lines just cracked me. And there are lines that don't make sense, and it seems that Tobe Hooper has just pulled the strings without thinking about the plot. Oh! By the way the plot is BAD! But it's one of those movies that is TAHT BAD which is really PAINFUL to watch. I recommend it only to BIG Brad Dourif fans or to fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.
