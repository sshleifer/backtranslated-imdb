"Plants are the most astute and cruel of all life forms", informs an aspiring victim of "The Seedpeople", a silly and flabby remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers", "Day of the Triffids", and a A thousand udders. And why are seeds more dangerous than plants, one might ask? Because, according to the same word, "seeds can follow us". Yes, I remember a horrible accident when the MooCow was just a calf, chased all the way from school by a ravenous dandylion seed ... Yes, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this small, squalid turkey resemble little tousled brats, some of which roll like evil tumbleweeds, others that sail on ropes. There is not even the slightest suspicion of terror or suspense to be found here. For reasons left unexplained, the semi-monsters are shot down by 50-volt ultraviolet lights, although they can walk in daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 more energy. As you can see, this mucus has not been thought of much. MooCow says you keep your garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
