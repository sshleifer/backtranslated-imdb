I went to a prescreening of this film and I was shocked by how bad it was. It was a combination of every clich√© horror / thriller, trying to comment on many things including pedophilia, Satan worship, undercover cops, business, religion ... and it was a disaster. the acting was a nice wash; the boy and the boy of Jesus were all right, but apart from them .... However. I admire the effort (albeit a little failed) in trying to show the Christian people in a different way ... even if they did, the way he presented the Gospel was a bit rancid and kiddish. But then again, it could be because he was talking to a child ... no. actually, I've decided it's all bad around. music ... oh my god ... horrible ... too too dramatic. All right. I felt bad for the people who made this film at the premiere; It looked like a poor student project. Now I'll stop making a face and say the final result, go see this movie if you want to waste an hour and fifty minutes of your shitty life. here you are.
