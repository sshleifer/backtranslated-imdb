If you saw this movie you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Each time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this film"? I can't believe that the Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Intense acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me it's not great fun for him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was superficial, empty and annoying as hell. I was happy when they were both thrown into the street. <br /> <br /> The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad boy role very well. The film was fun but I think Timberlake has ruined everything. It would have been a lot of fun without him. <br /> <br /> By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a video clip of MTV with flash, low motion and stuff like that. Something misplaced for this detective movie, I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a video clip of MTV for Timberlake.
