It is interesting to note that 90% of high-rated reviews all consist of "* random username *" from "United States" (no state pride ??) that say more or less exactly the same thing with the same grammatical style and all with the exact same lack of taste in the movies. I would like to investigate this suspicious trend further, but alas, this is a review of the film, and not the reviews themselves. <br /> <br /> Let me say that I am both a Christian and a true avid fan movie. This means that I have seen many films, from good to bad, and I can say with all my heart that Facing The Giants is NOT, in effect, a good movie. He has good intentions, but fails to satisfy many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality film experience. <br /> <br /> The Acting: Mostly Terrible, Palatable At Best. Feeling that most of them were apparently volunteers, it doesn't surprise me at all. <br /> <br /> The Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the screenplay looks like a long version of a scene of the kind that you would see performing at the Sunday School or at the youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of "meaningless words", but the cold and harsh truth is that such words are part of the real world, and the complete absence of it is palpable. Let's just say that the bad coach of a team in a state league game would have much more to say than "OH NO!" when things are not going the right way. <br /> <br /> The Plot: Mindbogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this film is "not a Hollywood clich√©", yet it is as if it was taken directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the almost romantic subplot for women) and had only a Christian coat of paint theme slapped on it. I am not lying or boasting when I say that I had almost all the major details both in the plot and in the subplot immediately after they began. Only those who have never seen a decent sports movie in their entire life would be excited by the story presented here. <br /> <br /> The Directing / Editing: Also, it was modeled almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie Model Yet, apart from attitudes, there weren't many noticeable goofs, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent. <br /> <br /> The Message: Ask Jesus and He will fulfill all your desires. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team's final defeat to really emphasize the whole "If we lose, we praise you" part, because in the Real World, you will fail at one point or another and it's good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you can't, clearly someone is messed up or is cheating. Another interesting question is, what if the Eagles ran into another team that got religion? Would they be caught in an endless cycle of miraculous dramas and last-minute bailouts, or would the universe simply explode? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: For the crowd of Christian Parents critical conservatives who complain about Hollywood's ills, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre Christian film to hold on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern cinema . For everyone else, the effects will vary from boredom to a burning desire to look at something else. And a warning: any attempt to show it to non-Christians will lead not to conversion, but to derision. I give these two stars, one for the scene that didn't make me roll my eyes, and another for the basic technical skills on a low budget.
