Maiden Voyage is just that. I would like to say right away that I watched 5 minutes before I couldn't stand it anymore. As already stated in another comment, this film does not fit into the whole "so bad it's beautiful", it's just bad. The acting is horrible, the sfx are poor and the story is insipid and stupid. Even the extras suck, the "sack guards" and seem to keep their weapons like water guns. <br /> <br /> Don't even worry about watching this movie, the only special thing is that, no matter how low your expectations are, you'll still be disappointed.
