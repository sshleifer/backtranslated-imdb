Otto Preminger directs this light like a feather. The Bohemian Jean Seberg and his bohemian relative Father David Niven in the south of France with the hazelnut Mylène Demongeot. Things are going well until friend Deborah Kerr arrives. Nivens, a degenerate womanizer, finds it too difficult to resist the conquest of Kerr. Okay with Seberg, until Niven loves her and leaves her (as he did with all the women of his past ... including Demongeot). When it appears that he is becoming a second banana in Niven's life, Seberg has an exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashback from Seberg's perspective and skillfully combines black and white with sunnier color scenes. Georges Périnal's cinematography is amazing. The film features some of the less inspiring directors of Preminger, though rarely allows close-ups, which makes it difficult to understand what the actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the script and is full of acidic dialogues and funny scenes (mostly involving Demongeot with a bird's brain). Seberg acquits himself quite well, but Niven is less attractive ... and shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really has the wrong steps with that casting. It's a role that seems tailor-made for someone closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as an aspiring suitor for Seberg and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco, playing herself, sings the title song in a Paris nightclub. The big titles are from regular Preminger Saul Bass.
