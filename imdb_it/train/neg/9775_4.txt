Fine performances and art direction don't make a good film. This film is so sad and depressing that I could not have absolutely joy for the "happy" ending concerning the union strike. The attempts at humor involving Lake's pregnancy are utterly disastrous, and any film involving a brother Baldwin already has an attack on it. On a positive note, Lang is still one of America's great undervalued actors, only he almost makes it worth keeping in the VCR. I give this a 4.
