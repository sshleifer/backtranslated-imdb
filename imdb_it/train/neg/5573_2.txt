I can't understand why so many Godzilla fans think this is excellent, one of the best Godzilla films ever. This film is horrible and one of the very few Gojira films I can't watch anymore (the other one is G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> The plot is too campy to be in the Heisei series, a series that attempted to turn Godzilla's franchise into bona fide action films, revolving around ideas that seemed to be more upright in 1974 compared to 1991. It seemed ridiculous, especially with some of the topics covered, for example the scene of the Second World War, with Japanese soldiers praising a dying Godzillasaurus, a mournful and serious tone, take the exuberant former capitalist shift commander and his death, visionaries in a movie, his fans somehow denote how they were played for laughter, like a stupid joke with guilty illogical amusement, if one of the most insipid movies I've seen so easily were, but I think it's more likely to be just the talent of filmmakers to fail and this was the case in a direct action film that went awry. It was made even worse by the fact that the special effects are terrible beyond compare, from jet packs to android, to hockey sound effects emitted by everything, it is impossible to take something seriously, yet the film is waiting for you, there is nothing elbow to the camera. <br /> <br /> Like almost all of Godzilla's films there is a useless love story, and this is no exception, although we can say something about the fact that this is particularly useless and inexplicable. There is literally no reason for the romance, it happens and there are 360-degree commitments for it. Apart from that, the other terrible aspect of this film is the dialogue, both Japanese and English are horrible, clumsy and probably the inspiration for Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Tristar's DVD combines the problems, making everything seem grainy, blurred, weak and simply ugly, the same was for the sound. I saw for the first time the version of the Japanese region 2 and the differences are day and night, with the original colors and texture, the soundtrack worthy of note, the fighting scenes in particular, are actually watchable. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Heisei series is a disappointment, with the exception of Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little to praise here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is the case of this failure. It doesn't even come close to deserving the reputation and the fans it gets. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
