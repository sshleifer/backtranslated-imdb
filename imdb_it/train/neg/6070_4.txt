Tony Scott directs a sports thriller film that should also attract non-sports fans. And some say baseball is a dead sport ... boring ... too damn slow. Well, here it is! On the outside it looks like a disgruntled salesman (Robert De Niro) while inside he is a psychotic fan of the San Francisco Giants. Here comes a new slugger (Wesley Snipes) and a savior designated by depression. Our salesman has a murderous obsession when the hard blow of all the stars falls in the worst collapse of his career and the Giants are afraid of falling apart with him. De Niro is personified terror. Snipes looks very natural like the baseball player. Other important characters of the cast are: the beautiful actress Ellen Barkin, John Leguizamo, Benicio Del Toro and Patti D'Arbanville. You're a free agent ... so have fun. We must expect violence and a very strong language and we get the value of money.
