"Masters of Horror" proved to be a bad arena for "message episodes", and while one can define a precise case for Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most of the efforts to make it come across as an anvil-heavy and little impressionable (nothing disorients horror more than a soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' simply merges reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; the young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen through the woods, was almost hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who have just started working for the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a cold and far-right pebble saint who will do anything to prevent his daughter from having an abortion. If for nothing else, 'Pro-Life' has accumulated some interest in its controversial topic, but John Carpenter treats the whole adventure with surprising indifference - he also seems less interested in making a film than the script itself (which is certainly poor ); the slow rhythm does not create tension and simply brings the plot already poised to a scan. Even when Dwayne and his sons break into the clinic, their guns on fire, it's an incredible non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a "male abortion", the scene becomes free and unnecessary - an effort to fill the signed film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become a consequence of the script, and Carpenter's management feels exhausted, as if "Pro-Life" were the source of his next hot meal. When a spider creature with a human head and a boy in latex suit prowl in the corridors, you just have to ask yourself what the minds behind this mess thought ...
