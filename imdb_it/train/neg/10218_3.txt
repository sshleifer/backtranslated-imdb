** Spoiler contained ** <br /> <br /> I had heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrible. What I didn't expect was the complete change of tack with about twenty minutes at the end. What begins as a typical Indian cowboy / western suddenly goes down in a very boring romantic "comedy" on Honus (Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) that escapes an assault of the Cheyenne cavalry. Most of the film then focuses on these two people in disagreement, then the romantic comedy. Donald Pleasance approaches and kidnaps them both without a real apparent reason. Then they escape and both rise (separately) to the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on Cheyenne's base. Since Cresta was married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs, he escapes from the base of the cavalry and joins them. So far so normal. Then comes the ending. After having endured well over an hour of poor acting that involves a clich√©, they will not get together in the plot, the film will then turn into a superior exploitation that includes, among other things, a beheading and a child shot in the neck. The similarities can be traced with the Wild Bunch at this point in the film, but the Wild Bunch has kept the same tone and has not resorted to extreme and free violence. In a sense, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, who also completely changed the turn for a final shock. I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor did I find the ending particularly disturbing, but I found it rather boring with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to see a film with a massacre of innocents really disturbing, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
