As a fan of Eric Rohmer's studies on contemporary war between the sexes, I was very much looking forward to seeing "The Lady and the Duke" for how he would treat men and women during a real war, French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, with every scene conceived as a vintage painting, like a tableaux vivant. And I was expecting a lot of talking, because that's Rohmer's style. But perhaps Rohmer was restrained by basing the script on the writings of a real woman, which is why this was felt primarily as a docudrama version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel." <br /> <br /> However terrible are the excesses of Robespierre et al, what about some recognition that the French aristocrats were spoiled brats? I kept humming to myself: "Marat, we are poor / and the poor remain poor" you could also choose a motif from "Les Miz". <br /> <br /> I was not as understanding as the central figure has to go back and forth between his hometown and the country manor to keep up with the revolution. At one point his maid claims that the pantry is bare but certainly manages to lay a good meal. I simply did not understand her, an English sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron while he and the revolution continue to shift political attention; I think I should sympathize with his coherence more than their political machinations, like a character in "The Scarlet Pimpernel". Hey, the only reason he didn't come home was his misfortune after a relationship and a son with the Prince of Wales or someone. <br /> <br /> Usually in a revolutionary period there is some wave of change in the relations between men and women, but here I have not seen any. Once I went to a conference by Herbert Marcuse which ended with a long question and answer session; the last question, from a much older member of the public than the rest of us acolytes, who was gray-haired, was "Why are the revolutionaries so sad?" She was teased and Marcuse did not deign to answer him seriously, but it is the only thing of substance that I remember from all evening. Rohmer shows that the counter-revolutionaries are also dark and didactic. <br /> <br /> (originally written 8/11/2002)
