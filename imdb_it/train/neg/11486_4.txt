Because some people, like me, love to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they intend to see it, including the ending. Anyway, here's the ending as I remember it, because I couldn't have been more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I will tell you, it is certain that he frightened the boy I was, and I thought about it for days after, and still stands out in my mind, even if some details are a bit vague. Was Abe Vigoda in this movie? I do not remember! I didn't even remember that Ol 'Barnabus was in this movie, and I loved Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the main character (Belinda Montgomery?) Is attracted by the judge (Joseph Cotton, I imagine, even if I remember him as if he were an old family doctor or something like that instead of a judge; does he vanish?) To the place of marriage, which as a souvenir is in a cave of some kind? Maybe I was wrong and Shelley Winters is there laughing, and the judge has a cloak on, and the camera angle is a bit like looking towards him, throwing back his cloak, and he has goat legs, and announces which in reality is his father, the devil, and he played in their hands (of the satanic cult), because the "mortal" type he fell in love with (I think he is Robert Foxworth) also turns out to be the type with which Satan wants to marry her , The Demon with Yellow Eyes, and yes, of course, show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes light up yellow. There are many close-ups in the last minutes of the film. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams or something like that, and this is the end. The bad guys win.
