This film really deserves the MST3K treatment. A pseudo-ancient fantasy hack-n-slash story with two barbarian brothers with a collective IQ of hot water, names of characters that seem to derive from a book by Mad Libs and classic lines like "Keep it down and discover its belly!" , Barbarians cross the territory "so badly, it's good".
