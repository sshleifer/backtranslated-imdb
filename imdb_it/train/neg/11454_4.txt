So I had great expectations for this film, but it didn't even satisfy those. while there were some fun parts, even one or two loud laughter, this movie fell terribly short of what I would call good. the funniest jokes were unexpected and very quickly, leaving us sitting there "WTF just happened?" besides, there were some jokes that dragged on and on and on. the part where it falls down from the mountain made me yawn. besides, the assembly was really lacking. there were some poor scene transitions, but that seems to be the style nowadays. It made me laugh, but I wouldn't have looked at it again, and I'm very glad I waited for it to be rented. Give him a chance, you might enjoy it, but don't think you have something like that on the 40-year-old virgin, or Superbad.
