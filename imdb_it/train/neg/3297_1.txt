Why make a show that millions of us have watched and loved as children and make it a complete joke? They ask why Hollywood is not making the money they used to make. Because they put out garbage and pay huge amounts of money to be junk and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where good guys from the IL came out on top. It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is rubbish! Hollywood can't invent anything original, so it takes something that is good and ruins it for some $$$$. I just hope this film does 10 times less than it would cost to do. The only ones who have fun with this shit are the guys who managed to lead General Lee. The public is the victim. <br /> <br /> Don't see it, watch the TV show replicas instead. They continue to resist 20 years later.
