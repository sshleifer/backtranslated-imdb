I would like to say that curiosity has had the best of me. If only I saw a trailer, I would be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved myself the most useless one hour and forty minutes in my whole life, and about twenty dollars. This film was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's an embarrassment for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a vivid ignorance of reality. For example, this child's remote-controlled racing car goes around the neighborhood, and even enters this house. He's even covered in clothes. Is it not rational to believe that a remote control can no longer transmit a signal in those circumstances? Obviously Hollywood didn't believe it. The common logic and any concept of electronics dictate the opposite; I doubt the race car could even have reached the road, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence possessed by criminals. Why is it in all these films, these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet an eight-year-old child? Is the boy destined to be the smartest person in the film instead of professional terrorists? Please, there's more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real gun and "accidentally" takes a plastic gun; apparently, he couldn't tell the difference. Even with a glove, you should be able to do it. Just because they look alike it means nothing; there are other senses so view. Even the traps are unrealistic; if any of them had actually worked, the criminals would have died. But Hollywood intends for us to "laugh" at the "funny" results of the traps. I didn't laugh; I sighed and looked up. <br /> <br /> But, I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will look like Citizen Kane compared to this. Otherwise, skip this for the sake of your pride. Even Home Alone 3 raises a question. We all know the stars of Alex D. Linz in the film, but did he write it too?
