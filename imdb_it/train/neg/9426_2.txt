After the opening credits, there is a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then she and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after so much stuffing, they hit something and slip off the road. They wake up in a hut inhabited by an old lady in a wheelchair and her offspring. Murders are sadly very domesticated for an alleged Nasty Video. The blow ends silly and predictable. No one involved in the disaster would ever do anything important again. So sometimes there are still happy endings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley becomes topless, and Laurel Munson has a complete front on display <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
