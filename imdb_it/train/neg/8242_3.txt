After seeing FIVE THROUGH THE EYES, I have to be honest ... I didn't like it. I had read a lot of good reviews on this film, but I couldn't figure out where these reviews came from, I have a lot of time for newcomers to make films, and I'm sure the directors will be fine for themselves, but the budget they had it was the main problem, there were two cameras used in the whole film (which was OK) but they looked like really cheap cameras. Another problem was the sound, all the girls screamed and screamed all at the same time, all of which exchanged words over each other - it is simply impossible to hear what they are saying. <br /> <br /> He had a good idea, in short, they hit a parked car and then they run away, shortly after they are chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has many opportunities to do it! ... and on the other hand the girls have many chances to escape, but don't do it! <br /> <br /> Very frustrating ... I just touched on this!
