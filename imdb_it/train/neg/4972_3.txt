It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: bad acting, poor acoustics of different parts, bad CGI, improper ensembles for the period, poor script. It would have been nice if the script had followed the original story a little closer - there is enough tension and good material in Beowulf to provide a great deal of good material and a better plot, than the writers could invent. /> <br /> And why introduce a strange new weapon like a crossbow that shoots explosive bullets? <br /> <br /> I see that this film was made in "only" 21 days. Show in the lack of quality. I'm starting to think this is a general attitude (poor) taken from the Sci-Fi (and others) channel when it comes to making films from classic stories in recent years. <br /> <br /> What a waste!
