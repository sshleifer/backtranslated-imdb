While I totally disagree with a reviewer who described Charley Chase as unattractive, in this film he certainly is. It's a pity, because I suspect the other reviewer must have seen only a few Charley Chase dicks and assume the boy wasn't funny. Movies like MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE and WHAT PRICE GOOFY? they are great Chase movies, so it could be really fun given the good material. Unfortunately, in this film he was given absolutely nothing. Even the inclusion of the usual good Oliver Hardy is not helpful because the basic premise (the boy wants to marry a girl, but the girl's father thinks that the boy is a kid) and the gags are so poor. It's a shame, because I really wanted to love this movie but I couldn't. <br /> <br /> By the way, for those accustomed to looking for Charley from the mid-1920s onwards, you will be quite surprised how Chase has no glasses or mustaches - and it seems very little like you would expect.
