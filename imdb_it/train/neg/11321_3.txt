You can't really go far when the initial story isn't that good. The premise of cyborgs' need for blood is simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The script is blas√©. Actors don't have much to work with. The sets were set up in the desert to reduce costs. It is a brand that if the background is desert, then the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> Lack of budget is ok, if there is a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from $ no. but this movie looks like they should scrape their change just to buy a sandwich cameraman. Once again, forgivable if only history was not simply crazy. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film commits the biggest crime of all: it doesn't end! It simply ends as if it were a commercial break from the rest of the film. But the rest never comes. Just weird. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
