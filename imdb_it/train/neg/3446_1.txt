It seems that this film on paper can be good, after seeing it I realized that this film was completely terrible !! The plot has no meaning, and I think I counted the best part of 5000 cut scenes each, making the movie more boring and boring. I watched this late dark night without any noise just to add to the SCARINESS of it, but the truth is the only thing that scared me was the music, what they would call tragic music, they will play the opera, I mean to be serious! ! This film summarizes everything that is not good for this type of film. To be honest I say no more but look at your own risk this movie is just complete garbage, FUN !!
