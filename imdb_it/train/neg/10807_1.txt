This film has successfully demonstrated what we all already know, that professional basketball players suck up anything besides playing basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can't even begin to describe how bad this movie is. First of all, is it just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a can opener. Secondly, why would a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry when, even if he has magical powers, he sucks to make music? Thirdly, I read the Bible. In no way form or form said that Jesus did the geniuses. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any nerd teenager with acne and a computer could have better effects than that. Fifth, why did the ending suck so much? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, anyone who created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown out of an airplane and onto the Eiffel Tower because this movie takes the word "suck" to a whole new level.
