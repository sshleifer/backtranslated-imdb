First, there are some positive things about this film, but it's all clich√© stuff combined with a teenage movie. In the commercial for this film, which I saw, a great emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards was there, but she is a poor actress, and she is not as beautiful as people try to make her (not the one who has something to do with the film). And what is it with that look that gives everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but like I said, acting ... Anyway, writing is good. You know who the whole movie is, and you can almost predict what's going to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging from the plot, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than look at it.
