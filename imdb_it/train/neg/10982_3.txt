The film had good acting and good times (although obviously a fairly low budget), but a negative assessment due to the fact that the basic premise was poorly developed. The main point of conflict between the two protagonists is not at all realistic. There are some scenes in which I disagree because of this, but no discussion of a great depth that would explain how they can be together while they see the world so differently, especially since Glenn's use of it has ended up in this way. this part of his life. (and Adam is quite active with his who supports him with time and money.) Moreover, many times Glenn is portrayed negatively to be the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam proves himself "honest and "traditional", which the film claims to be the "good" way in the end. I don't like to be preached for pleasure. I participated in a discussion with the director after viewing LTR, and he said he presented this conflict between them because , if he were in the shoes of Glenn (and said that in real life he relates to Glenn's point of view), he could never go out with someone with Adam's opinions ... Well, then, I think he should have done a lot of work better explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Moreover, the director said he directed this, his first film, only after reading (Directing For Dummies) .The director was not so bad, but far from an effort of prim Order: I've seen worse, but rarely the movies seem frustrated to me.
