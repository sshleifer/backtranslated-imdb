After seeing the poster of the movie Smother, I knew I was going to experience one of those intolerable cinematic experiences that make me want to look away. However, I felt a slight optimism because the film had a solid cast that I thought was going to save the film. Unfortunately it didn't happen. The mother is a horrible film, but it is not execrable. It's the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> Smother's script (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something that explains that they have anything but talent for writing films) is full of economic and predictable humor. Apart from that, I didn't even laugh at watching this movie. After the large number of garbage in which she was involved (such as the monumental atrocious and execrable Because I say so), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career is dying out. However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she brought to the previous Ten years ago, on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom.On Smother, she does her best with her performance, but her character is so horribly written which can't help it. Dax Shepard left a good impression with her solid performance in the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White also makes a good effort, but he doesn't get too far. He's a very talented screenwriter (as he showed in movies like The Good Girl and School of Rock), so I would have liked to see that he was one of the writers of this film, instead of just acting on it. LIV Tyler suffers from the same situation as all the actors mentioned above: being wasted. <br /> <br /> Smother's worst failure is absolutely boring and unpleasant. His script is nothing more than a collection of scenes and forced situations that we saw in sitcoms. Stay away from this disgusting comedy.
