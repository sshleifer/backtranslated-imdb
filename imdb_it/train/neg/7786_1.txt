I should never have watched this movie. The style of filming can be considered artistic for some, but it is considered by me to be a migraine. I think he might have had an interesting storyline, but since I couldn't see him for long stretches at a time I missed him a lot. The flickering images and the stop motion shots marked my brain. I stopped looking halfway and will not come back for a second try. I suppose if I were home alone in my lighthouse some dark and stormy night, this could just be the ticket ... PS I'm not sure that the headlight / movie style thing can be considered a spoiler, but I don't want to be blacklisted on my first review;)
