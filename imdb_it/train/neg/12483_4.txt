This film is like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There's a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery, but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it could "be a decent story. Richard Hill offers a solid performance in the lead role as well bad, which unfortunately does not appear in anything else.The fighting scenes are not so bad - I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword "drink" the blood of its victims - and there is a lot of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo. <br /> <br /> All in all, not good - but not necessarily so bad ...
