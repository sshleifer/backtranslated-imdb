David Mamet is a very interesting and very unequal director. His first film 'House of Games' was what I liked most, and set a series of films with characters whose life perspective changes as they get into complicated situations, as well as the viewer's perspective. <br /> <br /> So it is "Homicide" that from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer on the usual criminal drama. The main characters are two policemen, one Jew and one Irish who deal with an area for racial use. The murder of an old Jewish shopkeeper who proves to be a veteran of the Israeli independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> These were the flaws of the film are the most obvious. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually arrives at the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give great results, but the flaws in the story are too obvious to be easily compensated.
