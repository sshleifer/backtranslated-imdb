I thought watching business videos on corporate compliance was boring. This film didn't go anywhere fast. What could have been a rather half-hour half-hour episode turned into a seemingly endless film waste on the people who park their cars, a photo of some guy's pool (he really needs to answer the phone) a needle printer doing its job, and Heuy and Louey sitting in a yellow-lit control room repeating "T minus 10 and counting" as if something exciting were happening. That is not how you do not enlighten yourself. The best thing about this film is seeing James Best and Gerald McC, in something different from the famous TV personalities, and this is spreading to find something good. AND DO NOT get me started on music that was composed entirely of a tympanum, some large marine mammals, and microphone feedback. This movie is the closest I've ever given to one, but it gets the 2nd because I actually managed to finish this cure for insomnia, and I didn't have to leave me in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
