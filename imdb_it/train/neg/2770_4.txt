The Hollywood Hotel was the last musical in the film directed by Busby Berkeley for Warner Bros. His directing style has changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signed hits or huge production numbers with thousands of extra. In the late thirties, the big swing-style bands recorded the biggest hits of the year. The Swing Era, also called Big Band Era, is dated in various ways from 1935 to 1944 or from 1939 to 1949. Although it is impossible to pinpoint the time when the Swing era began, Benny Goodman's commitment to the Palomar Ballroom of Los Angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the first indications that swing was entering the consciousness of the dominant American youth. When Goodman characterized his swing repertoire rather than the company-style dance music his band had played, the audience's youth got wild. That was the beginning, but since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the main methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time for the swing to do enough spells to produce great hits that appeared in the charts. pop. In the Hollywood Hotel, the appearance of Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Raymond Paige and His Orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the change in musical taste (the film had only been in production for a year and a half or so) ). after the commitment of Goodman's Palomar Ballroom). There are some interesting musical moments here and there in the Hollywood Hotel, but except for Benny Goodman and his orchestra "Sing, Sing, Sing", there is not much to praise. Otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening of the "Hooray for Hollywood" parade and the production number "Let That Be A Lesson to You" at the drive-in restaurant. The film is very interesting to watch and listen to Benny Goodman and His Orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford sing.
