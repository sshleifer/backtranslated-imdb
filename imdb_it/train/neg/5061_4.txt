Anurag Basu who co-directed the KUCCH TO HAI flop made his debut in this film <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of its time in a way even though it has a different story and it was more close to HAWAS which came out 1 week earlier and luckily this was better and did better business <br /> <br /> The film starts well, Malika's guilt is well shown at the beginning although the scene with Emraan-Malika is too much vulgar / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are well managed and the turning point in the story in which Ashmith deals with Emraan is brilliant <br /> <br /> The rhythm moves quickly and the spectator is held on the edge but the second track of Emraan's girlfriend is not entirely convincing <br /> <br /> Even the police track seems to be halfway <br /> <br /> Even the ending is too filmed <br /> <br /> Directed by Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all the songs were fabulous Camera work was sb alorditive <br /> <br /> Emraan played his bad streak very well, this was the role that celebrity gave him and although he continued to play such roles and annoying in this film he was superb. Even Ashmith was good at his role for once, he did a good job and one of his only good performances and he looked good too. Malika was brilliant in her esp role in the second half but her dial delivery was sometimes not up to the mark Sadly she rarely showed such potential in other films Raj Jhutsi is fine
