So far after the second week of "The lone of Beauty" I'm a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> Some of the acting are good, as long as we except it's just a drama. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is a "factual" cover of the "Thatcher" years - it's ok as a drama, but I feel that the award-winning book is still much better . <br /> <br /> I wonder if the BBC will ever give us the following and the next part of the drama and the years that will follow with "Things can only get better" ending with 2006 and the Fact we are still waiting for! with that promised by a government that is full of disgust.
