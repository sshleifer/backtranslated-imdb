In this day and age of incredible film special effects, this was a painful disappointment. The actors seemed rigid and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerners are not a common price for Hollywood so much these days, but films like "Silverado" show that someone out there still knows how to make a good one. Considering this, it is difficult to conceive that anyone would go at any cost to release, much less to create a film as weak as this. If you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!
