The fact that this film was named after the most successful film in the history of Swiss cinema makes me shake my head! It is true, but pitiful at the same time. A film about the Swiss army could be much better. <br /> <br /> The story seems interesting, at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to perform his military training by the army while he is in the church, he marries his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter) . <br /> <br /> Acting in some way does not really differ in reality from some recruits who get drunk and stone themselves in reality. Melanie Winiger plays the role of the mediocre strong Michelle Bluntschi, personally I find it rather boring. <br /> <br /> The plot contains a comedy combined with a love story, which does not work as expected. The romantic part is too trash, and the comic part isn't funny at all, it's just an economic proof and doesn't change for the whole movie. It's fun for 12-13 year olds, but not for those looking for a fun comedy. Humor is weak except for a few clicks. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cold! To steal? Cold! If you want a good comedy on the Swiss RS, make sure you haven't exempted your military training yet, and even then don't expect too much! <br /> <br /> I'll give him 4 out of 10 stars, because Marco Rima is pretty funny during his time on the screen. However, it's not a lot of screen time
