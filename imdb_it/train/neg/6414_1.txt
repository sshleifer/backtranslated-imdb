This is the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It just made sense. It wasn't scary at all (unless you're afraid of the class as loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar needs to stop with these horror movies. I think everyone else at the cinema agreed with me when I shouted "SHITE" when the credits arrived. <br /> <br /> In my list of the worst movies ever made, here's how it should be: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The which is why I created Silent Hill 3rd because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was absolutely cr4p. The same with cabin fever made no sense, but the return exceeded that list. It's worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together
