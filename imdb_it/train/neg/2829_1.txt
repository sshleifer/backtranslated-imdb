The worst, and chock-full of people who should really know better (the cast has six Oscars among them). It is set in "contemporary" Africa (it was created in 1979) and concerns the slave trade. He is unpredictably scripted and acted, (Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov and William Holden achieve a low career in this), and the excitement is completely missing, regardless of any moral attention. It is also ridiculously traced. Don't believe for a minute that none of the characters would behave as they do in these circumstances. Richard Fleischer directs but you have the impression that it was by telephone. This is as bad as it gets.
