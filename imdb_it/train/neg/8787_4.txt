I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV commercial. Before that I didn't even know it existed. I saw the trailer online and decided I would go see it. Being now a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. There is Michael Keaton in it, and he jumps. Unfortunately the film did not deliver. He tried to be another sixth sense or mixture of echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the vehicle drags itself to repeat itself and ends with a completely poor turn that any monkey could have understood. Unfortunately, like most "Scary" movies nowadays it is based on loud noises and bangs to blow up the audience. This film could have been much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
