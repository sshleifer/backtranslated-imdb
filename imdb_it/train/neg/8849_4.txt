This is a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as the reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not bad and there is the strange actual scene. And it has an 80's cheezoid veneer which means it's always fun. Pay attention to the short appearance of Jimmy Nail: his attempt at American accent is so amazing that it is fantastic. Sybil Danning's breasts are also fantastic: they make a brief appearance in the film, but the scene is repeated a thousand times in the credits in what can be described as the 12 "remix of Sybil Danning's tits. It must be seen to be believed. As a horror movie it is not scary, the effects are stupid and Christopher Lee turns into a sleepwalker during his performance.I guess he is buying a new house and needs some money for the deposit.The two main characters - the man and the woman - they were so negligible that I forgot almost all of them and I just saw this movie before tonight. The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original film, in fact, strangely enough, sometimes they look more like badly burned monkeys.The European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, while being rather terrible, gives the film at least some added cheese. <br /> <b r /> Overall? Good for a laugh. Not of good quality but are you serious? sy expect it? And at least you've always had Sybil's shots.
