'Dead Letter Office' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service, who are struggling to rebuild their damaged lives. Unfortunately, the acting is poor and the links between the characters' past misfortunes and current mentalities are clumsily and oversized. The most disappointing thing of all, however, is that representation is life in the office of the film's title: there is no mechanization, and it is quite impossible to ascertain what any staff member really does to live. Of course, part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure, but this type of office certainly closed in the 1930s, if it ever really existed. It is a pity, because the general tone of the film is moving and ironic, and there are some promises in the scenario: but few details convince. Overall, you feel the work of someone who has not really lived much of real life; a film for students, with a concept and a scheme, but unfortunately little else.
