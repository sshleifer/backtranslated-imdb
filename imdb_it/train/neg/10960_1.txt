Ouch! Not much worse than this horrible adaptation of C.S.'s beloved novel Lewis. While the adaptation is very faithful to the novel, the acting is simply horrible and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I read that the budget for this miniseries was the biggest the BBC had ever given at that time, but they could certainly scrape together a little more than the $ 2 that seems to have been shot for it. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know that the effects of the computer were not at the level necessary or even expensive at the time, but the man in the costume shop in overalls was horrible. Better to cut the character of the movie rather than do it in the role! Avoid this at all costs.
