Don't pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about this film must receive royalties. This is a horrible movie anyway. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor doing a slasher / comedy video. They would have received a D for this. College kids would get an F or ask to leave school. Since this monstrosity was made by "Professionals" I believe that there should be jail time or at least the test of the cinema. I like watching bad movies like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" but that doesn't even fit into that category. The script, the acting, the sound and the direction are so bad that they are practically unwatchable. If you like watching bad movies that are fun, keep an eye on Ed Wood, blaxploitation or horror movies from the 70s. After seeing it, you have the feeling of having lost an hour and a half of your life.
