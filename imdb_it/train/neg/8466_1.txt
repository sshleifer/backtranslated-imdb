I miss the words. <br /> <br /> And this is not common. <br /> <br /> Done correctly this could have been fantastic, a fun parody of science fiction sci-fi, but unfortunately it was not. Rarely in the field of drama there are so many competent actors who struggle so vainly with such a dog breakfast of a script. I can only approve the comments of the previous reviewer: go clean the bathroom. In fact, do SOME THINGS except watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positives: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negatives: everything else. <br /> <br /> The most appropriate line: "This is not going anywhere". <br /> <br /> If only every plastic surgeon could meet a similar fate.
