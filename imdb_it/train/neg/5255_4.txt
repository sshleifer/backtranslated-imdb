Visually speaking, this film is sensational. It has some delicious black comic moments. But overall, the plot is very trivial, like its apparent message. If you are a fan of exaggerated violence in traditional movies like hostel or saw, you will like it very much. If you are looking for something of a high standard, turn away. I saw it as part of the Edinburgh 06 film festival, and chose it just because I was looking for something scary. Ultimately, it is not disturbing. Just grind and unpleasant to sit. If you sincerely want to be challenged, go see something like The Lost. If you want to be disgusted, or tell your friends about a really messy movie, then this is for you.
