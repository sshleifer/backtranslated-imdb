I have no idea what was shot, but you can definitely say that they had no budget. Bad acting, horrible cinematography and unpleasant plot and some decent special effects don't make a good movie. WWF-style cinemography will make you cry ... where is the tripod ?! The film producers were aiming high, but their mark was missing.
