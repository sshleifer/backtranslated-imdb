Generally I don't care much about violence in films or a great deal of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this goes very well with me and the film offers us many of these things. There are beautiful images especially of the lake and of nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. This film could be voted as a good movie. However, it is flawed for two reasons and both of these reasons make this film simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> First of all there is the violence used against living creatures to make this film. Non film violence, I'm talking about REAL violence. Perhaps only this violence could be justified and this is the reason number two; the message of the film was not a simple introspection on the directors intertwined with women. Not that we all don't have any real breakthroughs with women (men, respectively). But the conclusion of the film ruins everything. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" eventually dies (from here her own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it infuriated me, now the boy has come out with a new film that I am bewitched surely will not go to see) and now is even more clearly depicted as a kind of natural demon, the nature that grows on her, in particular her sex .. Obviously it is the director who "kills" the female heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. This seems to be the final conclusion. ** End spoiler * <br /> <br /> Well, well, anything that could be fine would be good for me if the director had kept his point of view. But to use large images, cruel artistic indications towards living creatures, only to say that men can be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. This is not enough. I knew that when I saw this film he would get good critics for "philosophical, oriental and artistic" and any approach. But for me this movie is completely ruined.
