I rented it on DVD yesterday and didn't realize that it was a type of "character study" movie, so I struggled to watch it about an hour before pressing the Stop button. <br /> <br /> Even with a study on theme characters, I just couldn't get into this movie. Maybe it was my mood in wanting to look at something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but putting that aside, I did my best to keep going and finish looking, but I gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination didn't come together to keep my interest. The only interesting thing was the subtraction of the sergeant's rifle and he hastened to buy another one, and he painted it black to look like a police problem. I think this movie should have been titled: "Who stole the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for something cohesive to show me. <br /> <br /> Since I haven't finished looking at it, I'd say there's some merit in renting this movie. .. could be. For me, it was a waste of good vision and time. I'll leave you the task of trying it, but that's not what I highly recommend.
