This movie was absolutely ... I can't find the word oh wait ... shit! I mean when it started it seemed so yes, this is beautiful and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and had nothing to do with the fact that I saw him late because it was total dirt. Ram Gopal Varma did his best but the cast was never up to the cast of the original Sholay I mean what he was thinking of doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year as you did for Black? Ajay and that other boy were good especially the other guy who played the raj because he was the one to watch. What was Amitabh doing? He's destroying his dignity by making all these stupid films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now I mean that he had to collect some of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as he could before he lost all his respect and I'm telling you he's halfway there. I mean all this is really good for other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who is having a really good name now due to the recent fall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he is God and I just learned that Abhishek would have been in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, look at Heyy Babyy because it's the funniest movie ever and it's number one on the charts!
