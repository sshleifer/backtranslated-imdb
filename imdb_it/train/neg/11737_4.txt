Well, I don't think the image is as ugly as most reviews prove it. . . but there is no denying that he has problems. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the problems are in the script. There is a plot - but not much history, and certainly not one that anyone could define as plausible; outlines any number of characters, lines, moments, what-you-you unknowingly strange and / or stereotyped and, in the end, didn't add much to this department. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but I couldn't care less about any "social malaise" that Farnsworth could try to tackle; there will always be a sector of the population willing to do anything to destroy their brains, even if it requires running into cornfields trying to steal ammonia, or whatever the morons do. So, as a movie, you won't find me calling "Iowa" "important". But, from a stylistic point of view, the image is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth's choices in depicting the state of a meth head are stunning, hilarious, disturbing and - yes, I'll say - inspired. /> <br /> The acting is irregular, but it could only be a victim of the aforementioned stylistic achievement. Listen, Rosanna Arquette is a good actress - but she's not very good here, so a member of the public who must be discriminatory must ask, "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and a grace that so few of the other actors can approach. For example, I could seriously consider any explanation that Farnsworth could provide for the exaggerated turn of Michael T. Weiss as a probation officer, but I doubt he would ever buy it; It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Then again, he's the most alive and the moment I saw John Savage appear in years. So go figure it out. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of job that entices, but does not promise - and that's okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make films. So if Farnsworth has another movie or not in him remains to be seen, but if he does, it seems quite likely that he will not be bland dad. In an age when people are planning their lives around the last episode of "American Idol", perhaps we could allow, not despise, the legitimate and undeniably flawed film of Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, perhaps we could accept, not reproach, his energetic and sometimes fortunately idiosyncratic imagination.
