Horrible. I see many user comments on how beautiful this show is. It's really a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame like ... and the plot is ridiculous. Obviously the actors are struggling to be funny and probably scoff when they hit those horrible jokes (if you can call them that). Most of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet (or at least from another continent). There are obviously reasons why television companies cancel shows ... and none of these is when the shows are going well. Does this make sense? Anyway, stay away - even if it's raining and there's absolutely nothing else on this planet to do ... go instead in the rain - more fun.
