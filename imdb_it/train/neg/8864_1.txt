After seeing this, I had lost some respect for Christopher Lee (this has passed over time). This film was total rubbish. First, they tried to recreate the end of the first "Howl" with an incredibly bad trick. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn movie! The plot sucks and the whole film is simply EXTRAORDINARY !!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first movie (from his appearance, he was supposed to be Dee Wallace Stone) joins Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who appears to be naked all the time . <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting (unless you want to waste time and money watching nudity). Try taking it on cable instead. It would be so belittled, it could really make sense.
