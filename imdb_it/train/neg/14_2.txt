There are times when finishing a movie you want to get a refund for the time just ended. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to resist ... and I wish I had ... <br /> <br /> The pace at which a man passes from a controlled and linear life to one of complete absence of spine and irresponsibility could never be so rapid. <br /> <br /> From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) a man of privilege and culture is seduced by a woman, with violence and with mind altering substances. Of course, the female part is understandable when looking at the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But having a penny for a sterling drug aspect, violence and dedication to a person you've just met is impossible to understand. <br /> <br /> Frankly, in addition to being able to fix Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no saving qualities. Save your money, save your time ... do anything else ...
