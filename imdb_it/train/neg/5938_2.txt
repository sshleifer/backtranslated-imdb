if I hadn't lived in the 90s or hadn't listened to the rapper EVER !! this movie might be good for you, but for any fan or single person who has ever heard rap this movie was boring and there was no sense in the movie where I said it was interesting or I didn't know it. another thing that bothered me was that it made it seem like everything in his life did it was very easy, there were no difficulties, he made the prison look easy, selling drugs and even rapping was unrealistic. I think that if the film released in about 15 years could have more impact maybe !!! good films rap and flow, get rich or die trying not to get noticed
