This is an extremely stupid and little-seen film about slavery in the West Indies and sees Puddy in the show "Seinfeld"! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this artificial film and is noticeably thinner here. Oliver Reed got the best reputation, but he's not in the movie at all. Warburton plays a white slave and it's fun to see all the horny young wives of rich old men bidding him because everyone wants to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays the owner of a brothel and there are so many nudes in the film. If his orgies are not drunk at the brothel, then his young wives were filmed with him. Then of course towards the end the slaves rebel and there is the damn stall. No real political message like the "Burn" movie, but just another forced storyline device to advance the story. Incredibly they did a sequel and Warburton and the rest of the cast is back! I hope a lot of money was paid because this first movie is pretty bad. Nudity keeps it watchable and Warburton's lack of accent sometimes makes it ridiculous. Very bad movie but I have to admit I want to see the sequel.
