I'm a big fan of Spaghetti Western Genre, and I usually like most of the cheap ones too. The infamous director Demofilo Fidani, however, is rightly known for some of the cheaper, sloppy and, better, worst contributions of the genre. The plots of Fidani's films were usually very weak and, as his talent was rather limited, he usually tried to sell the films by adding to the titles the famous western names of Spaghetti as "Django" by "Sartana". In the specific case of "Giù La Testa ... Hombre" of 1971 he just took the title of "Giù La Testa" by Sergio Leone (aka "Duck You Sucker") and added "Hombre". The film can be found under various titles ("Fistful Of Death", "Western Story" ...), I bought it personally with the name "Adios Companeros", which this film shares with another Fidani film with the same cast, "For a Bara Full of Dollars", which is also titled "Adios Companeros" in the German language version. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather weak, basically following a guy named Macho Callaghan (Jeff Cameron) and his involvement with two rival outlaw gangs led by Butch Cassidy (Jack Betts) and Ironhead (Gordon Mitchell). <br /> <br /> Jeff Cameron's main performance is, kindly stated, not very convincing. Nor did I find Jack Betts very good as "Butch Cassidy". The legend of the film B Gordon Mitchell, however, is always worth trying and, although he was probably not a very good actor, I always found his performances in Spaghetti Westerns rather funny and original, and in fact he saved some of Fidani's films (like the bad "Django and Sartana ... Showdown in the West". <br /> <br /> There is a very funny and original thing about "Down The Head ... Hombre" - the great Klaus Kinski is playing a priest! I could have imagined Kinski in any role, but before seeing this film I would never have imagined that someone would have chosen him as a priest. a scene, where a fight breaks, is probably the only positive scene in this one, and another interesting thing about this film is that the director and legendary king Joe D'Amato took the picture. <br /> <br /> "Giù La Testa ... Hombre" is an economic film foso, but in spite of everything, it has some funny moments. Being a Spaghetti Western fan, I found it fun to watch, but if you're not, it doesn't matter, or watch it just to see Kinski play a priest. 3/10
