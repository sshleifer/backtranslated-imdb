When I look for new cars, I expect not to be shown to the boats. When I drink the Coca-Cola fountain, I should expect the drink to contain Coca-Cola. When I watch a film that is embellished with the name of an excellent scientist, I expect it to be somehow relevant to that person or their work. It could be people talking about my grandparents' diary. The material covered is relevant only because it vaguely fosters science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch it, and the second time I stopped watching it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather watch them during the last success. However this is not able to provide something that is worth your time ?? Avoid at all costs.
