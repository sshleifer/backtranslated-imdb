I tried to track down this movie only on google bad words about "teenagers seduce and kill the man in his house" and so on. I think I saw parts of this film for the first time when I was about 10 when it worked with cable. He made a good impression! It's the kind of film that children know they shouldn't watch and change channels when their parents enter. When I saw who the cast was, I couldn't believe that some of these good actors were in such a horrible movie. Then again, if you like to see the men betraying their wives they are killed, then this is an interesting film. Also, if I recall, there are some pretty interesting pseudo-lesbian moments. Probably the most stupid ending of all time, but still ... memorable.
