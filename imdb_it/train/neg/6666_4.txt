I really wanted to love this movie, but the story is ridiculous. I don't want to ruin this film, - don't worry from the beginning you know something bad is going to happen - but here's an example of how this movie was put together. The Cowboy and "Twig" climb the ridge. The Cowboy has a handlebar mustache. The Cowboy and the "Twig" start shooting and run halfway along the ridge. The Cowboy is completely shaved for the rest of the film. At one point, between the shooting and the run down the mountain, the cowboy had time to shave in the dark on the back of a horse. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the acting of the four main characters is solid.
