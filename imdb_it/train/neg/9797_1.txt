Nowadays it's kind of a trend to watch all the shows since the early 90s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of these shows were / are undoubtedly good, this is just pure shit . I have seen this show far back in those days since it has had MANY replies on TV in those days and even as a child I did not like it. Even an 8-year-old child can see how much the people in the Power Rangers are exaggerating, and how the special FX has been sucked in since then. When the show does not resort to the painful "fight" scenes, it afflicts the viewer with this useless soap opera on a group of teenagers and they are small social problems every now and then. I don't know about you, but I didn't give mice an ass for anything like that, and basically they fill it up until they have to 'fight' a guy again in a very clich√© alien costume with fireworks or some toy - robots. You never feel "involved" in any way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors behave as if there was really no interest beyond the fact that their wallet improves the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing memorable about this show, and it is rather surprising that it has achieved so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). This is just a quick way to make some money. I challenge every "fan" to tell me exactly what emerges in the episodes that are supposed to be so good because I couldn't find anything that is even slightly appealing to children. My guess is that most of the Power Rangers "fans" will tell me that I "don't understand" anyway, or something like that. I don't really care; this was shit then and still sucks today.
