If you didn't see ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you didn't. A contest like "make your horror movie in a single day" is not able to invent a voice other than this insult to an insult to any viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets has forgotten a story, a storyline, a proper dialogue, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and the accredited lighting designer has obviously forgotten to show up. It seems to be recorded on the cruellest of the handycam and copied onto an even worse device. The effect of the makeup consists of a black mascara for the zombies and the yogurt that is poured on people's heads to simulate the fusion of the skin. This is nothing but a home movie, and also a very ugly one. Just fun to watch for friends, family and neighbors who were willing to show up for the shoot. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this joke about a product is listed in ANY serious movie magazine or website - I have homemade wedding films that are much better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same garbage.
