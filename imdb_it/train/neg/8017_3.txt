I didn't really finish the film. You could say that in this case I have no right to examine it, especially in a negative way. But I do it, just because I stopped him due to the fact that I couldn't watch anymore ... I ended up halfway, and I got there just by promising myself that something good was just around the corner. This film is so tiring, so lackluster that I was actually insulted. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure there are other homosexual teenagers who have suffered from it, but I'm homosexual and have gone through "similar" revelations, daydreams, problems, etc. Etc. There have been perhaps two moments when I felt that this movie could go somewhere, where I felt it could have some hint of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were broken when the next series of narratives from clichés. I mean, look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you are not able to hear the scratchy reproduction, nor does the eco-ey vanish if you have just read the quotation marks, because they are simply too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss. I gave the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the filmmaker who did a fantastic job trying to turn Archer's tired "concepts" into something lookable. Mind you, I pray that he didn't decide to include all the long shots of TV close-ups ... another unnecessary cliché already finished in films like Korine's Gummo ... I think it's extremely appropriate that this movie was premiered at Sundance (just because Archer had festival links with the volunteer work he did, by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival where a heavy cliché like that is still accepted as "d 'author". No, it's not an art house, I'm afraid it's just the s-t-house. Do not look.
