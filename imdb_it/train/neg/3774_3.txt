This film is old and the sign is missing. He is far from the 89 Batman he tries to catch. That woman singer what her name is cannot act, and let's see why her movie bearer is dead. Notice how this movie died in the box office no one sees this movie on TV. My uncle and my dad expected Batman, and the impression of the movie is more like that of Cop Rock. It is not worth renting 3/10
