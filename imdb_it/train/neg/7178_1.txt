Overrated and only for those 20-year-olds who wear glasses with particularly thick pink tints, which actually never saw him in the first place because they were young. Horrible animation, dialogue and a tired narrative. A real product of the 80s, the new found of a puzzle TOY (it is true, TOYS not the absurd, pretentious and childish alienating "figurine of action collectors"), sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other equipment , it only matters to those who bought the TOY when they were "actual" children in the period of "84" to "87". It has become a cult because those same adults are immature to let go of their memories. To avoid.
