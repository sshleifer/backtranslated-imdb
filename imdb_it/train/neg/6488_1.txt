Yes, the subject is a straight quote from the movie and I think it's pretty accurate. I was so bored to die with this useless effort. All flashes etc. It doesn't make sense after the first 20 minutes it's just a bad movie making + If you are an epileptic, you would have died at least five times. Of course all David Lynch fans would have raised the flag for this type of turkey to be "the best film ever made" because it makes no sense And when it makes no sense it must be art and art the film is always good Right? I say WRONG. This type of artificial art is just a pathetic way to prove that you are a good filmmaker. Anthony Hopkins as an excellent actor should simply act.
