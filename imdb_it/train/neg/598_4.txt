Please be careful: this film, although a rather ugly plot, was one of the most gruesome films I've ever seen ... NEVER. Remember that before sitting on your couch to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> So, officially start with a party. Just your average party but there's someone there. He's nice to Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. He memorises his face; will help you later. <br /> <br /> So, in any case, Kate goes to see George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. This is the London Underground in the middle of the night, but it's just as stupid as that. So the timetable says that the next and last train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now Kate, mad girl that she is, decides that she can take a nap in the free 7 minutes. Generally, she loses the train and finds herself locked up in the London subway. Only. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie continues from there. Blood, bowels, limbs, even some parts of the body that I will not mention are cut and torn and finally amputated by the body. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a typical horror; beautiful but big damsel in women of anguish and sick, strange psychopath. Or, as the case may be, Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say to try it if you are in Saw, Hostel or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but for the rest of us, screaming with satisfaction the horror needs a lot.
