Come on, what's the deal with this show, Power Rangers anyway? I always thought that the show, which was originally brought from Japan in a better form, took what was exceptional in Japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and unnecessary excuses in the history of toy merchandising! There is absolutely no point on this show. <br /> <br /> Bad haircuts, bad costumes, earrings, etc. They all show what was ridiculous in the 90s From the two idiots, Bulk and Skull, to the "duhs", of the main cast, Jason, Trini, Tommy, Kimberly, Billy and Zack, I just want to say one thing: GIVE ME A BREAK! <br /> <br /> Saban brought this from Japan, and then Disney bought the rights to this show about five years ago. <br /> <br /> Now the public has to endure the replicas of this show on the Disney channel and so. <br /> <br /> All I can say once again give me a break!
