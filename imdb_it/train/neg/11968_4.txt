This is typical of Bruce Willis, action film. Watch it with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it, to save money. <br /> <br /> None of this is realistic. The battles are not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. The victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt's character talking to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER? What happens with that? Can't he do it from inside the ship? <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. suffers a machete wound. There are a lot of medium explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie accurately represents the Navy SEALS, then don't get stuck in Africa waiting for them to come and save you! <br /> <br /> The noble attack on the village bothered me more. "Seats in the front row for ethnic cleansing" ... while Bruce watches the massacre going on in the city. So what does it do? Streak in the city on his belly. Yes. How many died while they were teasing? Oh well ... I needed a body count, I suppose. <br /> <br /> And if that African boy was so important, why didn't he get on the helicopter with the elderly and children? Can you say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. Not only in the plot, but so much at night it was difficult to understand what was happening. <br /> <br /> Rent.
