Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's go straight: this is a loathsome piece of rotting rot with the sh * t cow on it. It's just a horrible movie. It is an urban werewolf film with some of the worst imaginable recitations and a weak story like any nerd gangster in a 1980s drama. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was tricked into the role of the gigantic wicked werewolf. Kane f * cking Hodder. Someone is trying to make sure that playing Jason Voorhees is the pinnacle of his film career ... <br /> <br /> However, even former Playmate Jaime Bergman is in the film and eventually becomes a werewolf. It's a kind of cop-crap with the worst-looking werewolf in the world. But he has moments of almost unbridled nakedness. But that's all. Want to know more? Ok, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur that flashes across the screen. And when we have the privilege of actually seeing a transformation sequence, we are presented with something that looks like a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really so primitive. Only good for hardcore horror fanatics who want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by unrestrained visual vomiting. 2/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
