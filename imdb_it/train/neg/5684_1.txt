badly addressed garbage. a mediocre and sadistic sadistic nihilist ... if you're the kind of person you like ... see a shrink. even if you are that person, this is not a good movie, the acting is really poor, the story full of holes in the plot, the director should really give up and find a real job since he has no talent for it. I can understand why people don't love uwe boll .. we have completed some of his films lately and this is the best of them, which is really sad! A complete absence of any kind of humanity seems to fit some people, but here it just croaks. Horror movies can be full of desolation, they can be works of art in miniature, they can only be a good vision when there is nothing else on ... SEED is really really poor.
