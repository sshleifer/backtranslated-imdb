The films have put me to sleep before, but no film has ever done it twice, so it took me three sessions to finish it. The dialogue was bad. Women spoke in style and men were caricatures. And two of the alleged Japanese women seemed Chinese, they had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the men of Emmenthal got sexually tied together. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a difficult choice: do I give this film a rating of one? or two? <br /> <br /> The films have put me to sleep before, but no film has ever done it twice, so it took me three sessions to finish it.
