For the first time in years, I felt the need to sign up for IMDb today to purify myself from this film by writing a review, because it was just a disappointing thing to watch. The plot sounded wonderful when I read it, I was expecting a mysterious minimal thriller, a claustrophobic ghost chase. Unfortunately, everything is watered down so badly by a trivial and tiring love story and by too many artificial and insignificant nonsense "nothing-says-things-like-this-except-in-the-movie-bad" -dialogues that is just dying. <br /> <br /> Here's a quick rundown of the worst crimes in this movie: <br /> <br /> - The script is based heavily on the coincidences and the inexplicable and unforgivable stupidity of the main characters that is just ridiculous. No, actually, he is angry. He is lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to this: economic thrills. A long "just in time" parade. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Well, it seems that the writer has never lived real human beings in real life, but instead he has acquired all his knowledge from bad movies. So his characters are boring, ruthless second-generation clich√©s. They are simple weft devices, carriers of places without the slightest personality. They are "men and women in disintegration who still love each other". I've never seen it before except in 100,000 movies and it's no longer realistic or pleasant. Think of the blandest two-dimensional in Hollywood and you have it. There is not a character in this film that is even remotely fresh, fascinating or interesting. <br /> <br /> - The far-fetched and vague resolution that is swinging very badly and needs only a push to overthrow, even if the word "resolution" may be inadequate here, because the film is a swampy disaster that does not it's going nowhere anyway. But the moment you finish, you don't care anymore. I just mentioned the last third of the film, because it was so unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> Ok, that's it. Whatever redeems the features of this film, everything is buried by incompetence. Don't look at this asshole.
