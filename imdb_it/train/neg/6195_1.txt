A bad act A terrible acting and a final that the director seemed to come up with from nothing, given that the film had been nothing short of boring. Disconcerting that this film is considered for a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater had the same opinion as me - what was the purpose of making the film? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or simply not properly thought out. I am amazed that this film was released - very, very disappointing and a waste of time. Sorry, terribly negative review but I hope it will discourage some people from the same mistake. Too bad we didn't have a Q & A at the end of the film - now it may have been interesting.
