The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was his nomination for the original design of songs and costumes for the Oscars. I have to admit that I wasn't very impressed with this movie. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (from the way Glen Close plays this role very well) is released from the hospital because of his good behavior. She likes all the animals and tightens all furs. From that moment on, we are just waiting for it to start having crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat in the fashion world, naturally for herself and with beautiful Dalmatian fur. In addition to Glen Close, I found all the pretty silly but funny-looking casts. This is fair enough because its target market is, I assume, children under 12. Good entertainment for children and families, but it didn't do much for me. * outside *****
