This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen without a doubt. The only interesting thing in this film are the cameo appearances of some great genre directors and King himself. The film has a great premise, but it falls to pieces about 15 minutes in history. I liked Madchen Amick in this film and I think it could have a great career in film.
