This is just a little appealing to "bad film" entertainment fans. Worth more for the pop culture students of the 70s: fashions, furniture, attitudes and that great moment of the "lib" of women in the early 70s, when it was still fresh and new for an independent woman independent that existed. <br /> <br /> "Superchick" (Joyce Jillson) had a monetarily rewarding career if foolish (after all, being a stewardess but a 30,000-foot waitress - also for male ones), she slept around with more men, he could protect himself and others (with karate) and was not tied to anything. This is the kind of emancipated woman who frightened the juices of anti-feminists, those backward idiots who believe that no woman is complete without a husband. <br /> <br /> The "sexy hostess" was a powerful archetype of the 1960s and 1970s, (geez, also on "The Partridge Family", I remember the bachelor swing Ruben Kincaid connecting constantly with the hostesses) and from this point of view, this stupid film is a temporal capsule of the important pop culture of pre-AIDS, free love, women's lib, seventies. The plot is pretty horrible. And for those cavemen in the public, there are a few bare tits to look at.
