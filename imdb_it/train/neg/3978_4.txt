When in Rome it is a definite improvement for how to get there. Arriving there I found it too predictable, inventive and slow, and to this day I still consider it the worst of the Olsen twins. However, while When In Rome is not a terrible film, it is not even that great. If I had to sum it up in one word, I would say passable. It's fun for teens, but I think adults won't find much to do. <br /> <br /> When it has its positive sides in Rome. Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are pretty decent actresses, certainly very beautiful. I have to admit that when I was 10 I liked them a lot, and in general I still like them. And I enjoyed some of their films like Passport To Paris and New York Minute. Back at the target, both girls don't do such a bad job, on the contrary they are very attractive. Moreover their clothes are to die for, and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking. The soundtrack is not even half bad. <br /> <br /> However, where the film is shot down it is in the plot and in the script. The script is largely clich√© and has a hint of deja vu. The plot, like most of the films Mary Kate and Ashley, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other work by the Olsen twins will find some rather original elements. Most of the characters are thin cardboard, and not much is learned about them, and sometimes the rhythm is not uniform. Unfortunately, the breathtaking scenery is ruined by a rather crappy machine work, which seemed constantly rushed. <br /> <br /> All in all, it has its positive points, and certainly watchable. However, for my taste, adolescent fluff is harmless and predictable. 4/10 Bethany Cox
