Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the greatest comedy of all time, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of low-cost articles, many of which were parodies of major Hollywood films. After a dispute with Anderson, Laurel continued the informal parody series to Joe Rock's smaller (and more indigent) production company. <br /> <br /> Most of Laurel's parody films were only slightly amusing at the time, and even less fun for a modern audience who didn't see the original film that Laurel is parodying. 'West of Hot Dog' is a fairly general parody of cowboy shooter. It is marginally a specific parody of "West of the Pecos", an oater released two years earlier without major actors. Since "West of the Pecos" has never been a huge success, it's hard to see why Stan's film unit chose this particular film as a target for their lamp, much less because they waited so long after its liberation to parody it. And where did they take the title "West of Hot Dog"? Perhaps it is due to the fact that "Hot dog!" it was a sexual interjection favored by American lechers in the 1920s. (As in the opening scene of the drama 'Machinal'.) <br /> <br /> 'West of Hot Dog' was produced and co-directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other successes, Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson, and later was the best man at their wedding. Full disclosure: in the last years of his life, I had the great privilege of making friends with Joe Rock and interviewing him. Nearly ninety at the time, the memory of Rock was extraordinarily clear ... but he didn't remember anything about "West of Hot Dog", and I can't blame him. This film is absolutely forgettable. <br /> <br /> The woman's main character is called Little Mustard: if this is meant to be a parody of something in "West of the Pecos", I don't understand. There are a couple of "impossible" gags here, including Laurel's method of riding a horse. For just one moment in this film, Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly started running. 'West of Hot Dog' is vaguely similar in material and tone to Keaton's short comedy 'The Frozen North', but Keaton's version is much more fun. The plot of this film somehow anticipates a situation in Keaton's "Our Hospitality", but (again) suffers in comparison: here two brothers of demanding relatives expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon, but the previous owner l 'bequeathed to the tender weak Stan. However, the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies. Hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Seriously though: is it a legacy of the legal genre? As soon as Stan takes possession of the property, surely any further application for property or inheritance will become his decision, not the decision of the previous owner. I had plenty of time to consider these points of view while watching this boring play. <br /> <br /> At some point, a gag involves some raw animation drawn directly on the film. It looks cheap and it's not fun. <br /> <br /> This 'Hot Dog' is not a weiner, and no winner: it's just a whiner. My assessment: one point out of 10. Wait, Stan: in a few years you will be half of a legend in comedy.
