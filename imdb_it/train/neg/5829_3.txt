I saw this film as a preview of an art exhibition by Matthew Barney. He certainly prepared me. I almost skipped the show and, in retrospect, I probably should have. <br /> <br /> Apart from the excellent score (Bjork) and the rich and colorful photography, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Damn, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to understand what the pearl fishermen were doing. The film was mostly a foolish mixture of Japanese cultural references and industrial blows of modern whaling technology used in fake hunting / gathering. The film "beats" with enough free shake to turn the stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the film? While others may argue that this is a piece against whaling, it could also be argued that it also somehow justifies whaling. Personally I think it was Barney's attempt to "blink" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-mutilating and cannibal fetish. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: unless you are really excited about Barney's artistic sense, don. Don't worry about seeing this movie. The message is obscure, the slow rhythm and the pretentious cultural references. If you are looking for the art of shock, you will do better in one of the many "Undead" movies or you will hunt an old copy of Hustler and take a fecal cardboard.
