The wonderful "Z" channel in Los Angeles showed this film Pia Zadora about six months after "Butterfly". I had so many hopes for the actress, and then she goes from bad to obviously WORSE in this film. <br /> <br /> Again, it was the 80s and I have to tell you that the work of Harold Robbin had been eclipsed by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann tore it to pieces (she hated her way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work was captured by many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his reign in the late 70s and early 80s and then Jackie Collins who made women stronger and equal to men in every way in his books, even more. This is why this work smells. Harold Robbin's work in the 1980s did not go well with the public. Pia Zadora who played in one of Robbin's works was like throwing a kerosene on the fire. Even the supporting cast was not helpful. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... this was terrible to look at then and even 20 years later, it looks even worse. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and everything was shot for hell when this was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters who chose her in "Hairspray" was a spark) even though she has a beautiful singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hi, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go on tour! Join the show. You could be the biggest return story yet. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie for you, if you do.
