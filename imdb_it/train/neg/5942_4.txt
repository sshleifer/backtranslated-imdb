If this should be the experience of black, let me get out of the front door as well as the back door. <br /> <br /> A mom's boy one day sees 2 young hoods walking and from there on it's all down to him. Angela Bassett, the only luminous grace in this film, plays her protective and religious mother. Despite his anger at how his life has changed, in the middle of the photo, he really decides to accept it. It allows its friends to enter and suddenly it's okay to use vulgarity as long as it's not in front of children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. <br /> <br /> I literally laughed aloud when in the end, when Bassett is accompanying his son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been interrupted at 24, he had become a man. What a man? He had been a convicted criminal, he wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that, as a health worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what happens in our schools. The complete and total lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> The rivalry between the eastern and western coast gangsters is never fully explained. All we see are firearms. <br /> <br /> A terrible picture that does nothing to prevent group violence. What horrible patterns of behavior are these rap singers and their obscene music. The African American community should make fun of its own being. Who was this fat classless fat who played Biggie? It made Rerun appear from the old TV show in comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that turned this chubby kid into the vulgar monster he was. What a sad state of affairs when this is called cinematic entertainment.
