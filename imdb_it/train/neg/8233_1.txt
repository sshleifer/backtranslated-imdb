This was probably the worst movie ever, seriously. I could really do better on my own, it wasn't even set up properly. It's like this movie has a budget of $ 5 and left with the rest. Don't watch it I didn't even do the whole thing for this whole movie, I had to turn it off. I gave this 1/10 because it was exhilarating how the producer of this film wanted it to be a horror movie, but it actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a group of girls crashed into a car, broke a beacon and the owner of that car went after them. The piece I saw was a woman with a gun telling a load of girls to take off all her clothes, what the hell? it must also be a kind of cheese porn movie.
