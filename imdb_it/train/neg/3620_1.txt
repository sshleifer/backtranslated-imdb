I tried to watch this abomination of the cinema when I was five; I've never been the same since. Filled with drug-induced images that stink from the common delusions of your kindergarten-based media, this "film", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, especially not children. <br /> <br /> Start out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum (wait for it), putting his head through it; yes, putting his HEAD through it. But fear not, my friends! He is quickly consoled by his chiring flute, which is quite strange, I grant you, but it is still acceptable. <br /> <br /> THEN: The film turns into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are, but loses all the "warm and indistinct" aspects of one of these two books. <br /> <br /> Then, this relative of seven yellow-colored Barney's, befriends this poor boy and plunges him deeper into despair. br /> <br /> And, to add the pleasant series of terrifying themes, a carnivorous boat, once a friend of the heterogeneous group of swinging pendulum clocks and drugged "dragons", is added to the mix of chaos. <br /> <br /> The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, rightly nicknamed "Witchiepoo" (?). Of course, she has her own problems: what with an obvious plastic mask that forces her facial expressions to face a broom whose gas level always seems to be at its lowest in the most inappropriate moments. As a result, one of his favorite pastimes was diving into the body of water that separated the land of Pufnstuf from its degenerated and decaying home (I don't know where I would have preferred to live). > <br /> In summary, this film is terrifying ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see the film that has similar effects on its audience like The Exorcist, then this is for you. To enjoy.
