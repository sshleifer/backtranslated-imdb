Sometimes I like really bad movies ... those that occasionally occur when people (even talented people) join good intentions to make a movie and for whatever reason turn out to be a disaster. Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from Outer Space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate", etc. <br /> <br /> So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic", was considered by many people the only worst movie of the decade, of course I absolutely had to see it. <br /> <br /> Boy, I regret that decision. This film is beyond evil .... it is so harmful that it is not even as funny as the usual bad movie. Acting, filming, screenplay, etc. They are even worse than a cheap porn movie: the sound is absolutely horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is ridiculous ... it's a total waste of time and money. At least the porn movie has a porn to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy holding a rotten apple and a "mad hatter's" tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting is non-existent .. Many "scenes" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as good. The "writer-director" (I use the terms roughly), David Tybor, tries to become extravagant with slavery scenes ... but the results would be laughable, if they weren't so pathetic. There is a bit of nudity, but it is of such an abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressor. I could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this terrible film waste. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, avoid this train disaster. I know that despite (or maybe because of) my negative comments, you might still be tempted to see if this piece of junk is really as bad as I claim it to be .... but trust me on that .... it's even worse than what I said, and you will absolutely and positively regret the experience (and the expenses, if you waste your money for a purchase or a rent).
