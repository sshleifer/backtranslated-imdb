Hawked as the most offensive film EVER, GUARANTEED TO SEND ALL ... Guess what? It worked, I am offended that we paid money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and we decided to see if all that bubble on the movie we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage! It was by far the worst movie I saw from Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but I got sucked into that. Since then we have beaten the sting that suggested we rent it, and its movie-taking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing strange in this film ... even the scene of "Dickman's adventures" was on the second floor at most ... Color me p *** ed. I thought maybe the value of the production was crap for some important reason ... no..it just sucked. NEVER LOOK AT THIS! for any reason. Even with copious amounts of illegal substances this film would be fun. This is saying HIGH. Please, for the love of all that is holy, if you care about your sanity, never look at this movie. There are many things - stupid, useless and useless to name a few. But the main thing he was aiming for was: offensively funny: he failed miserably. Stop and burn ...
