When a film like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings in over $ 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our society. Either we're collectively too stupid to stay out of the garbage this way or maybe I'm not realizing how many people this kind of useless waste like. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has not had any incentive to make good films because if it puts out the garbage then people will see it anyway since there's nothing else on the screen. This and that. I went out even though I received a free movie pass. Dialogue could not be more stupid. The stunts could not be more exaggerated and outrageous. Perhaps this "bigger than this" image is aimed at Texans, but neither attracts me to anyone else in the theater. None of the "big names" was in this end-of-career film, except for Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - don't make me laugh. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't even recommend this movie for video, even if I was desperate. It was a matter of deceiving the public to make enough money after the opening of the day to match or do better than it cost through marketing. They did so even though the public was warned. Stupidity abounds.
