Completing the "Our Gang" release program of the 1929-30 all-talkie, "A Tough Winter" features two plots. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, at home alone on a winter day, decide to do some taffy. Little Wheezer transmits directions to Mary Ann from a radio show. The problem: Wheezer transmits information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Fun moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull out the taffy - and they end up having everything for the whole house! <br /> <br /> The second plot concerns Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor / handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang. <br /> <br /> "A Tough Winter", as far as I know, was never shown on television, although it is available on home videos. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows an elusive, sneaky and slow character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "clever comic strip" and used this "Our Gang" as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is offensive to many people today, which explains why the film has been shelved. <br /> <br /> Although there are some fun moments with both Fetchit and the taffy, "A Tough Winter" is a snaking arrangement and effort. If a positive result came out of this film, it was that Hal Roach Studios became confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film partially paved the way for the excellent "Our Gang" films of 1930-31. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
