Even if it were remotely funny, this moldy wax from a movie would still be soberly disrespectful. Stop just before digging the bodies of the boys and re-enact "Weekend At Bernie's" ?? but only ?? Producer Larry Harmon and the director of these "Ernest" films use copyright as an excuse to shit the whole legacy of Stan and Ollie. Gailard Sartain does a decent imitation of Ollie but Bronson Pinchot will not reach tenth place in a Stan look-alike contest; even if they were both commercials on the film they would not be less detestable. At least said about the surrounding catastrophe, so much the better. It makes 'Utopia' look like a dignified swan song.
