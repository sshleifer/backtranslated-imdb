Beyond the cheap dirt, this shot-on-video exercise of ineptitude was difficult to overcome. It has the typical gore you would expect in a zombie movie, but none of the atmosphere necessary to make it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is that this is a German amateur video, and the I version is English-dubbed! The voice actors seem to be American fans (the pen pals of the Germans?!) Who cannot decide whether they want to interpret it or turn it into a comedy. A character (a white German, of course) is nicknamed by a seemingly black boy who speaks with thick ebony! 'Kno wahm sayin', Comrad?
