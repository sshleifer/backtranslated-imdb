I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This film was painful for me. I had to use fast forwarding so as not to fall asleep. It was boring! How can someone ruin this title so much? History was the only good thing. The actors were sh.t. They can't live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a null. Look at the other roles of this actor. The fighting scenes were incredibly boring and unworkable, somehow they didn't have to follow the situation. Like other reviewers, he said low budget movies with bad actors. Maybe next time someone else can do better than this title. The French cannot do the right thing with great movies, like Alien 4. This was a bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
