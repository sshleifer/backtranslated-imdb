This is without doubt the worst Rajnikanth movie ever. The first part takes place with a solid comedy by Goundamani, but progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also digs at Saints with the same name (Baba) through a banal and absolutely lame monotype. In the first time Rajni pronounces his usual series of oneliner and style and in the second half he becomes a saint almost after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal on the Himalayas where Babaji (not the famous saints he dug earlier) gives has powers special without apparent reason (other than karma). This is really starting to get interesting right now? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is about him wasting his magical powers and powers and fighting against the politicians and the relative black magic. The usual predictable crap with exhilarating implementation. Oh, and black magic never worked on our hero because he happened to have a Param Vir ... er ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad and the usual political villains are clich√©s, overworked and eventually, completely insignificant for the plot that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the flaws, it was fun killing time with and yelling Baba connected the one-liners during public events. It's also fun to watch others curse this movie. It is said that AR Rehman composed the tracks for his film through the mobile phone. Here is how important it was to consider it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this film just for the sake of it But the way in which they are portraits, clothes and treaties is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese could stop watching Rajni's movies after seeing it. This film was probably a promotional material for Rajni who entered politics, but the results of the film itself would have killed all his political dreams. <br /> <br /> Funny if you turn off your brain though.
