After the exaggerated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish horror films spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is everything in films like El segundo nombre, a badly written television production, but performed even worse. I haven't read Ramsey Campbell's book, but I'm sure The Doll Who Ate Its Mother author didn't have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you are looking for a quiet sleepy night in a new cinema. 2/10
