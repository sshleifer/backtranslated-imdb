Ah yes 80s, a period of Reaganomics and Sly, Chuck and a host of other action stars hidden in a remote jungle that blew away commies. At the time I could not believe that films like RAMBO, MANCANTI IN ACTION and UNCOMMON VALOR (and who can forget the ridiculous RED DAWN?) Made money at the box office, they are turgid in action with a rather disproportionate punishment of the wing agenda and are dated very bad. TROMA`S WAR makes fun of you for this type of film but do you have to ask yourself to need spoofing in the first place? Obviously not . TROMA`S WAR has no kind of sophistication - even if it suggests that there is no real difference between right and left wing tyrants - and sometimes it seems more like a z-level movie than a sender. Maybe it is?
