I could not give this film a negative rating or a negative review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential to be a thriller and there are some slightly disturbing elements that lean on the psychological one which was something the film could have focused on a bit. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a nightly narrative deejay who is going through personal matters: his lover moves out and Gabriel is having what appears to be a case of blocking the storyteller. One day he receives and reads a story written by a 14-year-old dying man named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuses he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his adoptive mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel tries to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland cannot even exist. I won't go into details because I don't want to ruin the film, but I'll tell you this: it's quite predictable. Charming atmosphere to tell a story and good interpretations of Robin Williams and Toni Collette, which I thought was the key character of the film. Collette is without doubt one of the most talented and beautiful actresses. His ability to draw on the psyche and personality of the characters he portrays is very disturbing and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she could get the award for best supporting actress for this if the script was a little better). The film begins as a psychological but predictable thriller. If you are curious about the ending and the turns of the film, look at the film otherwise I would trust another predictable thriller called "Hide and Seek".
