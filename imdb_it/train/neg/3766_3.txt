I went to watch this movie knowing it wouldn't be great. but what I witnessed was terrible for words. I don't mean to be tough, just the movie was terrible. overall it was bad, I meant terrible special effects, the acting wasn't so bad, but it wasn't good, and the sasquatch itself was like .... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion the best sasquatch film is Harry and the Henderson. it's not violent or horror, but has the best representation of sasquatch. at least it's a suit and not a semi-ass cgi cheat. watch this movie only if you are desperate or if you really appreciate someone in the movie. or go see the saints of Boondock, it's MUCH better.
