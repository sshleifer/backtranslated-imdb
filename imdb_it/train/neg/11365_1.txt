This is a very sad film. Really. Nothing happens in this movie The script is bad !!! I imagine they have just copied and pasted the first 15 pages into 90 pages. The producers must have thought of creating a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They didn't succeed. Now in the third week it's only going to Antwerp and Brussels at 10.45pm or something like that. In the past we have had some good films in Belgium, like Daens. The nuances are a waste of your time. Maybe you could sneak into the theater after seeing a real movie. If you've seen 10 minutes of nuances, you've seen it all. It was advertised to death on local radio and TV. I hope it will soon disappear in the shades.
