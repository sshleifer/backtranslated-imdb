I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations, he was still disappointed. The most glaring mistake in this abomination of a film is that the main point of the plot (the guy who is awake during the operation) had NOTHING to do with the result. It would have ended the same way regardless. So what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, did this surgeon have 4 medical malpractice cases against him and didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely devoid of talent and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was simply ridiculous from beginning to end. I'm pretty sure that if you could hear someone cutting your chest with a scalpel, you would do more harm than that.
