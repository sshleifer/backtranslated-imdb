This bomb is just one "explosion" after another, without humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics in the extreme. Reality is not one of its strengths. I give him a 1 out of 10. I would have made a zero but that option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But sometimes we all need money. And I still find myself in that farce of Tim Burton on Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit he was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, then this movie isn't even a gizzard. I wish I could say, "give me my money back". You can bet I'd do it if I could. But that's the problem with premium services, the variety of subscription.
