CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it is becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best voices like CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING from the mid to late 1960s <br /> <br /> In itself MATRON is not bad at all, it's just that we've already seen all this with a subtle plot (a group of spits trying to get into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills that they intend to sell to third world countries) surrounded by gags of a nature that is a bit funny but not sophisticated. I think this is where the problem lies - the gags are not so funny with the unsophisticated nature that starts to show its age. Do we need another film that uses a man dressed as a woman to guide the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon, less than twelve hours ago, and I have a problem trying to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for a play
