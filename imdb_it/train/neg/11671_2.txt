I have to say - it's a stinker! (I gave a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of sets that chew and pile up, but not much else does this movie. There is no suspense, no profound, shocking secret revealed, no real threat to the welfare of heroin. Some disagreements, a slight increase in rumors - it's pretty much everything. The secrets are nothing that can't happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the film is completely predictable from that point. <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, revolves around a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly), who is an artist, who is hired to paint a series of wall panels in a huge ballroom in a vast villa by a very rich and very rich widow woman, and a growing relationship between mother and daughter that the old woman craves with her. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the daughter of the older woman, Cassandra, is dead. You can very well fit the rest of the pieces together. <br /> <br /> Even the scene with the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not advance to the point where he really fears for his safety beyond perhaps a second or two. Because it's still around for years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question that in this vast villa there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything ... cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. Everything except apparently blocking the door - since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters enters a room where Faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing you can grab at the arms of your chair and lean forward on the edge of your seat, because there is no "growing" tension in this film - just silly and pathetic revelations that are popped up from time to time. <br /> <br />
