I have never seen the older version of 1973, much appreciated. I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage (by the way, acting well as usual). This film probably took all five minutes to fathom the entire plot (I can see it being done on a cocktail napkin at a dinner party), if you can't understand the end of this drooling in the first thirty minutes you'll probably find fun this film. This is, in recent times, the terrible furrow that Hollywood seems to have dug for itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, unable to give the public enough credit and to write a fresh, intelligent and alluring script, which rips out a disturbing music Add a couple of things to get yourself a little jump and then send the final print to your local theater. At least, he didn't have jiggling hand-held camera syndrome.
