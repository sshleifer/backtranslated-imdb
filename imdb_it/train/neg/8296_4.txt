Basically, a team of husband-wife of dentists and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> The problem is the plot. The husband dentist leaves his wife in the backstage of a work before the show (he plays a minor role) and then comes back to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the film deals with his anguish about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter ego (Denis Leary, one of his former patients) and his fear of facing his wife for fear that he should "do something about it." I'll tell you the ending, but let me tell you that the film is not going anywhere and the ending is like a spitting cry. The motivations of the characters are missing: why does he betray him? He is a decent looking dentist, a good father. The film does not say. Who are you doing it with? Don't expect any answer about it. Why does he want to keep the marriage despite all this? Who knows. What purpose do all the children who vomit serve? Where is this movie going? The good performances of Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as a comic relief) are completely wasted by this absurd nonsense that he doesn't know if he wants to be American Beauty or a family movie. A root canal is more interesting. Avoid it.
