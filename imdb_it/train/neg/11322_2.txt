There is a word for this type of film, and that word is "drivel". It was unpleasant when it came to a VHS rental, and it's drivel on satellite re-runs now. <br /> <br /> It might fool you, because it has 2 moderately known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen, music from the reasonable soundtrack and beautiful Monument Valley scenery. <br /> <br /> He also has a curly-haired woman who fights a lot. <br /> <br /> If that's all you want from a movie, then maybe that will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> It's still drastic, though.
