Curiosity brought me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I didn't rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the producers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? Man has given a new meaning to the term "finger lickin 'good"! And with all the flashbacks and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all the performance of Jeremy Renner was not bad. You can take it in "S.W.A.T.", in which you play a dissatisfied former cop. However, I would classify it as 1/10. He only got a 1 because of Renner's brilliant performance. There are plenty of books and TV documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering up Dahmer's crimes. Avoid this.
