If you plan to watch this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually publish my comments on something I saw on television, but this was a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to take that bad taste from my mouth. Criticizing this film would take too long because there are so many things wrong. I will simply say, please never see this movie. It was a total waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours. Anyone who has written a positive review of this film is one of two things; absolutely inept, or working for the company that produced it. Again, I guarantee you will really regret having seen this movie!
