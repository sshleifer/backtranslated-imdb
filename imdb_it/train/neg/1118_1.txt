I was really horrified by this disturbing movie. What an unusual and dark atmosphere. And such terrifying music. Really promising! In fact, after ten minutes you really start to sweat and you feel uncomfortable, because you start to fear the worst. This film has the atmosphere of a real nightmare and, what is worse, it all comes out. For an hour and a half I tried to fight boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly terrifying image - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and above all: your wallet, since the thought of spending precious money on a ticket for this homevideo amateur is the greatest horror of all.
