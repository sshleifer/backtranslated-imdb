I have just seen this movie and I must say that, although some effort was shown at the beginning to produce a decent film, this was absolutely horrible - but not in the sense that I am sure. <br /> <br /> It was as if a child were directing this insult towards intelligence with the conviction that all aspiring spectators were deficient or extremely difficult for entertainment. Or both ... Thank God for the advancement fast! I can't imagine the kind of spectator that the producer had in mind when he made this film. I mean, you have actors who try to be serious, even if barely, and a script that cries for a total rewrite, .... I can't say anything else. If Harlequin Romance decided to make horror films, this would be a good attempt. <br /> <br /> If you found this movie funny, I strongly suggest you look for directions on the purpose of the movies. There is VERY BETTER rate out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, avoid crap like this.
