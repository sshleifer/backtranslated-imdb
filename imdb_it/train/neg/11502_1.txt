This film is painfully slow and has no plot. It transmits the lives of a group of fired boat workers. One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social comments here, but it is confusing because no one is painted in a very comprehensive light. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why he had a 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I looked at the whole boring part and built expectations for a huge redeeming success. With no luck. The evaluation of IMDb has always been a good combination for my taste. Anything above 6.5 was worth watching. <br /> <br /> And my wife says that Javier Barem doesn't even look good in this movie. It is not my type, therefore, my agreement does not mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give him a 1.
