I have been searching for this film for centuries because it is quite rare to find one of the video nasties. I finally found it on DVD late last year, it's a very low budget movie. The story is set around the tribes of the Amazon jungle that live in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model who is kidnapped by a gang of thugs while working in South America. They take her to the jungle Laura is guarded by a ridiculous native who calls herself "The Devil", but must go through all the unpleasant things until they are happy. The girls are chained. The devil proves to eat meat horribly. Peter Weston, is the devil hunter, who goes to the jungle to try to save her,
