This film starts off promising, with a scene in which Frank Morgan advises against the marriage of Gary Cooper with his daughter, Anita Louise. Frank Morgan, who plays a lousy prospector of gold, complains loudly to Cooper about his alleged shortage at the hands of his family - including his daughter, Anita Louise. I'm a fan of all 3 actors. Frank Morgan is (in my opinion) a Hollywood treasure, Cooper a legend, and Louise a very beautiful, versatile and undervalued actress, rarely seen in the lead role. Furthermore, I have nothing against Teresa Wright and, although she is not lucky with a wide range, she usually offers shows that warm the heart. <br /> <br /> From a promising opening, the story slides downhill to the end. I found nothing humorous in burning the home of Cooper's would-be in-laws. The butler in such a demanding, non-smoking family would never go away cheerfully, allowing Cooper to continue smoking, or alternatively will certainly provide him with some means to dispose of the inappropriate cigarette. Moreover, no one with common sense would leave themselves in a lit cigarette without asking for a means to dispose of it. And in the end, no one in his right mind crushes a cigarette in a handkerchief and puts it in his pocket! This whole sequence made Cooper look foolish and clumsy. It is a bad way of conceiving - ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule and not laughter. <br /> <br /> Cooper's forced medical examination is equally forced. No one is allowed to undergo a complete medical examination without being advised of his purpose or consent! That Cooper did it is too far from reality to be funny - it's absurd! Stealing children from hospitals is a serious legal crime, and even that is not funny. Finally, Cooper's overly scrupulous and neurotic attention to feeding and the weight of his baby may have affected the nerves of a few people who have felt anxiety for their own newborns. But to me they just seem boring and slow. The wardrobe and the production divisions prevailed in those scenes, while, paradoxically, the screenwriter went to sleep. <br /> <br /> The lines are not only in the script to generate humor. Only missing on all cylinders. Laughter does not reach a mile per minute, but more like a light year per minute. The only time the film has energy or humor is when Frank Morgan is in the room. <br /> <br /> The scene that is completely wasted is when both Cooper's love interests and their respective fathers are locked up in the same hotel room together. There is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine, but none of it has been extracted. <br /> <br /> In the end, one of the two very nice girls will get hurt. Predictably, it's the character of Anita Louise, who leaves her promising wedding night behind! Even if it's not on the camera, this is his destiny, and it's not particularly funny - even as a free end. He had done nothing in this film to make me indifferent (unlike Gail Patrick, for example, in My Favorite Wife). As a result, I was expecting (maybe "hoping" is a better word in the context of the film!) For Anita Louise also for a happy ending. The fact that such a beautiful character is essentially wiped out at the end of the film really undermines the effect of the "happy ending" for Cooper and Wright. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen, for the witty dialog box so characteristic of the films of the time ... And it was never delivered. A good performance by Frank Morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here.
