I don't like to use the word "horrible" to describe any film work for which you spend a great deal of time, effort, talent and money, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte BrontÃ«'s novel "Jane Eyre" is a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> The screenplay has no finesse and power, all explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. The main actors are sadly misplaced, clearly hired for their star names, and the unpleasant and boring musical score. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemical connection between them. It's like a wet noodle, even worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least was capable of a minimum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt recites the whole film on a tone and that tone is flat and lacking in energy. Obviously the soft and silly script does not help any of these talented actors in their efforts to give a touch of life to this film. Joan Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax is like a Disney creation that keeps popping up to sweeten the scenes where it would have been best left out. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery surrounding the history of Rochester's first wife. The role of the aspiring second wife, played as a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson, is an empty figure. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very big actress, is completely wasted as Jane's Aunt, Mrs Reed. It would have been better interpreted as Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, as Jane's beloved teacher, evokes genuine sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of "Jane Eyre" after seeing Robert Young for British television, made in 1997, with Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and deeply moving version is like a nova that explodes with respect to Zefferelli's wet mound. <br /> <br /> I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, of which I have read very well things on this website. I am amazed by how many people have appreciated Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> All I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored, as well as being a real disaster.
