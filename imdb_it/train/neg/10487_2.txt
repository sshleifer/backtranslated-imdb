OMG! The only reason I'm giving this movie to 2 instead of 1 is because Tom Hanks is as fun as Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from that, how did this half-decent cast make such a lame film ?? Maybe at the time it seemed like a good idea ... There are no laughs to mention, stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the director is amateur. Now that I think about it, most of the blame is probably from director Joel Zwick. It brings out nothing but flat performances from everyone involved. Don't waste your time like I did; but then, I enjoy a beautiful train disaster. Damn, now the system is telling me that I need more lines-- here it is: this movie should be called Return to Sender. Ok, now it was more fun than anything else in the movie ...
