This photo reminds me of a photo of Keneth More of 1957 entitled The Admirable Crighton "while on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and after being saved he returned to the servant. Madonna did well in some films, but this did not If there is any image showing that Madonna can't act, this is it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if it was a thin copy of "The Admirable Crighton", but it seems safe. if this is the case, then Hollywood has to run out of ideas and this is sad: provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and for this reason it fails in every corner and detail. <br /> <br /> The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. The script should have been passed through the shredder before taking it to the spot. While many here have boxed Madoona throughout his acting I think that in movies like "One of their league" has been or pretty good and fun and "Who's That Girl" showed an oddity in Madonna's style not shown before or after. Other Madonna films are not so funny and I would have liked to see a series of Madonna Animation with the character of "Who's That Girl" I like the music of these two films, however "Swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain such . <br /> <br /> does everyone have the right bomb?
