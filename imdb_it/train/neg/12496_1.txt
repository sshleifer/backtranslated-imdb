To be brutally honest ... I enjoyed watching Severed. This is why I have <br /> <br /> given a 1/10 star due to its history / film / acting / acting / all strictly non-fanciful <br /> <br />. This film was a RIOT to watch. If you like bad movies for fun, you'll like it <br /> <br /> really to Severed. <br /> <br /> The story does not matter, involves a boy who is bald <br /> <br /> and has a sword and goes around decapitating random people. <br /> <br /> But it has a supernatural touch ... nobody ever sees it. <br /> <br /> Even when, in a truly memorable scene, he enters a night club full of junk and tears up a girl's pasta and nobody sees it. <br /> <br /> Severed does not just look like it was filmed on video. It was <br /> <br /> filmed on someone's home camcorder. The directors had the knowledge of lighting (a very subtle knowledge) and the composition <br /> <br /> is actually held together in some scenes. But above all you can't hear <br /> <br /> the actors ... you can't understand what they are doing, and laugh <br /> <br /> when the next winner gets his pumpkin detatched by his body. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie. It supports movies like this: they are a hoot and <br /> <br /> a hollar!
