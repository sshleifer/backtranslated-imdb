The second part of the revolutionary biography of Steven Soderbergh on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. To keep his holy face of Che Soderbergh skip the frogs with ease the mass executions he presided after the revolution in Cuba and the madness of his adventure in the Congo ("This is the story of a failure", writes in his preface Congo Journal) to fully focus on Che's attempt to mobilize support to rise against the government in Bolivia. It would have been a disaster and Guevara's final act. <br /> <br /> What tormented the first chapter here follows how Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific face of the contemplative Guevara once again played as James Dean in Bernicio's Eden of Eden Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has little success in getting converts and soon he will find himself and his hungry companions being swallowed up in the heart of the darkness of the Bolivian jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent Aguirre, the wrath of God Soderbergh fails to exploit the metaphorical possibilities of the jungle to increase the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned about maintaining Che's nimbus over his head than exploring the panic that settles on the dead. There is a Herzogian moment in which Che sits astride a stubborn horse that kicks and screams to make him move, but overall Soderbergh's scene is flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both of his films, Soderbergh clearly shows that he is a group of Che and because of this his goal remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little to develop his relations with the key players in his saga, particularly Fidel Castro. To make matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that does not catch fire. One might think that he was quite involved with Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that radical change is much better exhibited with a radical style.
