This film, a sensational time for its far-sighted policies and depictions of free love and sexual liberation, has been reduced from time to time to a simple curiosity. It seems absurd now that this mostly boring little film has been banned and seized by the governments of many countries. Given how socialist Sweden eventually became, the 'radicalism' of its once controversial policy appears naive and almost mainstream four decades later. And his sex scenes, once the subject of sensational evidence of obscenity, seem rather quiet in a modern context. Nevertheless, the film and the documentaries that accompany its numerous controversies and influences remain marginally guardable as one of the first reliquaries of the youth uprising of the 1960s. A part of the film that still holds: its self-awareness with respect to the "fourth wall". From time to time, the filmmakers film themselves by making the film. The satirical playfulness of this still gives a little laugh.
