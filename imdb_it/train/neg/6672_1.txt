I'm 47 and I've spent most of my life as a memory, a fan of horror and science fiction movies. Whether silent, in black and white, without budget or high budget, there are very few of which I can't find something I like. Having said that, I will give credit to this film for the good blood and the effects of the creatures, but that's all. This is a case of effects on history. The truth is that we live in a time when there is very little left that has not been seen in a horror film. So for a movie of any kind to entertain it you need to have a good original story. A good story can overcome the negative effects and bad acting, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This film doesn't even have good acting, just good effects. So, unless you can just talk about the blood, pass this.
