Since Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon arrived, much has been said about a revival of the Hong Kong film industry. I do not believe it. The people who are now making films in HK give new meaning to the word "crass". Running Out of Time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the draw name here, but he spends most of the film just smiling idiotly and tossing a coin. Turn the coin around again and again and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman chasing the handsome guy who throws the coin. But again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress in the female lead who runs a kind of company and has to pay a ransom or something similar, but mostly it just seems like she'd rather be in a spa or a mall than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? Who cares?
