Despite the overwhelming cult followed by this sad "documentary", I must admit to having cordially deplored the film that struck our party as a piece of exploitation that is much more distressing than helpfully informative. Having said that, after seeing the magnificent musical on stage taken from it, one can appreciate what the film could have been in safer hands. <br /> <br /> It is suspected that many of us who have suffered actively during the film have had some camping delight whose cruel fans had fun destroyed by suspicion that too many of us - or those we know - are alone a misstep or two away from the deplorable situation of the two crazy women who live and contribute to a squalor who seem unable to control or flee. <br /> <br /> The film leaves the viewer desperately wondering how a person might have slipped to this level of degradation and, unlike the musical, offers no warning clues or explanations, just a horror show not redeemed by the humor or intuition. <br /> <br /> This overwhelming flatness of the soul of the film makes it even more remarkable the achievement of the theatrical version (which will hopefully be filmed at the end for the cable). Act II is faithful in almost every detail of the film under discussion, but strangely, putting the sad condition of prisoners in music, it raises the human tragedy in art. More importantly, this act is preceded by a beautiful act in which we meet women before their dignified mutually enabled madness, and clues are offered as to how their isolated purgatory occurred. In short, everything that the FILM lacks. <br /> <br /> To the credit of the filmmaker (or his successors), the excellent version of the Criterion DVD includes out-takes and bonus material that partly redeem the main film - behind the scenes of photographs, interviews and comments - filling some of the gaps that the original montage has deliberately decided to omit in its search for unadulterated horror and depression. They can't make the amateur movie satisfying, but they can at least make it a little more understandable. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, though, it is only the remarkable theatrical work inspired and drawn by the writer Doug Wright, by the composer Scott Frankel and by the lyricist Michael Korie, who raises the score of the original GRAY GARDENS above a single (generous) star.
