I will not say anything about the plot, because, although it would be highly predictable in any case, the only remarkable turning point is given everywhere, in the film's comments, in the plot summary here, and also in the synopsis on my Netflix envelope. I would have liked it better if I hadn't known. Could be. This film has a deceptively good cast, most of which have acted credibly with rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller pieces. It was impossible to appreciate William McNamara, but it was clearly of design. And there were a couple of quick nude scenes of the Calipiano Lenore Zann. But none of this gives me the slightest recommendation. Do any of these good actors read these scripts before signing?
