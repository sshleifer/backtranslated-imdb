I remember when I was little when I was away at the camp and we went camping under the stars. There was always someone there who would have had a good story to tell about the woods that surrounded us and would always insinuate me. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it hoping to be one of those movies that had a supernatural being that haunted people in the woods, just like the stories told at the camp. Well, to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story begins when a family of three is driving to their cabin in winter, which looks like your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they come across a deer. Well, it seems that the local rednecks were actually hunting this particular deer and are rather angry with our city people. The film spends too much time following the daily activities of families instead of getting to the point of the film. It was not until the last 15 minutes that we actually had any action regarding the "wendigo". My suggestion is that you are a long way from this movie. He'll let you want your hour and a half back.
