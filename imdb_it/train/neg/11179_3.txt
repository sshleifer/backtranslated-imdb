As much as we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this film. An advertising hack in the end dirty of what appears to have been a distinct and idealistic career. Pacino interprets his part as an unmade bed and attacks everyone with a totally false and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The plot spools in this way and with so many moves and improbabilities that the mind reels (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there, not doing much. His scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, illuminated the screen. It was electric and its scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting of the film, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
