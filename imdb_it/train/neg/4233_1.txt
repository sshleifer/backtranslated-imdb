I couldn't believe I spent $ 14.00 for this. The only thing that redeems is outrageous blood. Dubbing has been worse than any I've ever seen. It looks like it was shot with a VHS video camera. I think every pfennig was spent on special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to acknowledge the abundance of blood that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible
