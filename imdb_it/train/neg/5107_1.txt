There is an English version for this show that is rather less extravagant than the American version. The person concerned will receive a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what he has achieved. The American version of this show is all that TV reality should not be. Instead of making some improvements to a home that the occupants could not afford or do alone, the whole house is being rebuilt. I don't know if this show is trying to show that bad welfare system exists in the United States or if you implore hard enough you will receive. Also the placement of a rather vulgar product that takes place, in particular that of Sears, is not required. Rather than turning a family into a disadvantaged area into potential millionaires, it would be much better to help the community as a whole, where instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home, building something for the whole community ... maybe a place where you can borrow kitchen and do-it-yourself tools and return them along with construction materials so that everyone can benefit if they wish. Giving everything to a person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community that still lives in the same degraded houses.
