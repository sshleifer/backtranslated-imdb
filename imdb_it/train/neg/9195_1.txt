Stretched out and drugged, while a kidney stone wound through my scarred urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than to let the painkillers abandon me in semi-oblivion, I happened to take this film on cable. I wouldn't want anyone to think that I paid to see it in a movie theater, or rented, or ?? paradise for trust! ?? that I looked at it RIGHT. <br /> <br /> After playing this sensational creepy video game and eagerly trod the condemned rooms and the earthy passages of The House, fighting Chariot (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041), and other impossible sentinels, the my curiosity was stimulated by how the game would move to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The trivial plot revolves around a group of "crazy children" ?? to the Scooby Doo ?? attending a remote island for a trembling "rave" of the world ?? whatever it is. (You guys today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone ??) After bribing a boat captain in cash to transport them there (a stupidity that begs for their rhetorical network), they find the " deserted "rave." <br /> <br /> The quote is made of a "house" - presumably the title House Of The Dead - but most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and others local divorced from any semblance of haunted residence. <br /> <br /> A dropped video camera serves as a flashback fill, showing the island prey to a party ?! Is that it? Oh, so this "rave" thingy is just a "party"? In the great tradition of re-euphemising "used cars" such as "pre-owned", or "shock shell" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", the word "party" is now too square for you , in implanted, metrosexual jagoff? <br /> <br /> It was learned that the party was interrupted by wild zombies. Intelligent thinking stopped here ?? <br /> <br /> I don't think the foremen who call themselves screenwriters and directors understand the myth behind the re-animation of the zombies. Zombies can't die? I'm already UN-DEAD. They don't bleed, they don't know pain. Unless their bodies are completely destroyed, they will continue to be animated. At least, that's what my Jamaican witch priestess tells me. <br /> <br /> Which means that a .45 shot in their "hearts" won't stop them, and not even a machete on the bust. And a shot of a gun in the chest will certainly not lead to gout of blood. At least in the logic of the video game, the shooter pushes so many rounds into every monster that is completely decimated, leaving a fetid mush that cannot revive itself. <br /> <br /> However, each model of actor-bar gets their moment with the Matrix circular camera, which kills zombies on all fronts with single bullets and karate chops towards the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the "Return Of The Jedi" Stormtroopers, which are thrown out when Ewoks makes them stumble. <br /> <br /> I suppose the writer of the film, Mark Altman, wrote the not-too-Shabby "Free Enterprise", felt compelled to include a reference to Captain Kirk, in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who was supposed to desperately needing money for milk for having succumbed to appearing in this aromatic dung-manure. There is also a reference to Prochnow's first role in the magnificent "Das Boot", when one of the inexperienced B actors claims to "look like a U-Boat captain". I wonder how many of the target audience of square-eyed piglets have taken into account ANY of the bureaucratic references to other films, such as when Prochnow declares "Greet my little friend", foreshadowing his moment of machine gun. /> <br /> Aimed at a demographic that does not have the means to understand the uselessness of Sisifoide of the videogame concept (ie the game ends when you die ?? you can't win), this is just a slasher film for the disrespectful without mind to heart. As a result, everyone dies in due course, except for a heterosexual couple of attractive white people. <br /> <br /> A better use of the film's scarce but poorly used budget may have been to send the cast through Acting School, even though Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, like the right breast? ? and those racing scenes: priceless! I particularly liked the final scene with Ona trying to act like she was stabbed, but it looks like she just ate ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Attempt to do something more with my time frame, I pulled out my anamorphic DVD of "Manos: The Hands Of Fate", digitally restored, 35th Anniversary, Special Edition, Widescreen. Oh yes! ?? the drugs were appropriately numb - now HERE was a quality film production ?? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
