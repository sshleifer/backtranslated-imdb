This little show is obviously a bit silly prequel / spin off of the original series. <br /> <br /> Compared to the live series this show is a real shit. The live show had intelligent jokes and plots. While the animated series is basically a bittersweet version attenuated for younger viewers to digest, but I think maybe kids hate this shit. <br /> <br /> The plot of each episode is basically just Sabrina has some stupid and useless dillemma and she uses magic to solve it. This is basically the idea of ​​each episode. The most bizarre episode was when Sabrina uses magic to become Gemma and Gemma to become Sabrina. So Gem becomes a witch and ardently hypnotizes to become her slave. This leads to a bizarre but rather interesting scene: Gem says "I adore myself for now" and Harvey gets on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like a god. (which is right since he is his slave to mind control) But this stupid spin-off is not worth the time or effort.
