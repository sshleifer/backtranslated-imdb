First of all, I'm not American or Middle Eastern. Secondly, I don't have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sports and movies. From now on, I believe it would be better to serve to provide an opinion of neutrality and prejudice free. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a real dishonor. This terrible event should be used to commemorate all those innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbarous and uncivilized idiots. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films were alleged attempts to score various political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Segment by Ken Loach. Of course, we are all sad that this boy has had a hard life in his country, but what does this have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes are not good ?! Everything! This film should have a subtitle for those who have difficulty listening to a partially inconsistent Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disturbing is the segment of Youssef Chahine. It is obvious that he has problems with logic. He justified the murders due to: America is a democracy and because some Americans voted politicians in power, so all Americans are ultimately responsible for the actions and decisions taken by their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this guy real? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know what religion is practiced there; and the majority do not know the real political problems that take place behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chahine, the reason we all have these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims of the Twin Towers came from all over the world. Firefighters, rescuers, employees, riders and passengers have nothing to do with politics. Still, we are not allowed to talk about our lives because "some" people think that everyone should choose a part or a religion. We are perceived as a fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its victims bombed. Another director who uses this event to push his political agenda. Sometimes, it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me". Sometimes, it's about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Ouedraogo segment is a joke and another political top scorer. Obviously they want money from the international community highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This film denigrates the memory of the victims "of September 11th 2001. <br /> <br /> The best thing is the TRASH CHANNEL.
