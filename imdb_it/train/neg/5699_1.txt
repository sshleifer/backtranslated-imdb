WOW, this movie was so horrible. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay to watch this horrible movie. it was like a fool of history went on a coke spree! the previews of it made it look decent but it was REALLY bad. I will say that the idea seemed decent but come on. it was really very bad. If you sit down and think about it, you realize that it was UNREALISTIC. come back the day you think you have all those things to work with. It wasn't as if one day Frank sat down and did a damn riddle. it was completely ridiculous, and you want to see a bad movie then go see this. Everything and the whole HORRIBLE movie could actually be in my top 10 of the worst movies I've ever seen.
