This film is one of the worst comedy movies I've ever seen. I hate these imitations of Napoleon Dynamite. Just look at it, people have already learned the mute humor. Create something new for once. All these new plays are simply horrible. And coming out of SNL, Andy Samberg is not yet ready for a leading role. I hope he can recover from this horrible movie. And the character of Will Arnetts is simply bad. Hey, you read the script. The plot is really the worst ever written. Now tell me if it's weird. (this is the movie) Rod Kimble's stepfather, Frank, is dying and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for Frank. Only then can Rod beat Frank in a fight and prove his virility. Yes, this is the movie, you tell me, you would spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of shit! <br /> <br /> 3/10 simply horrible <br /> <br /> -adam
