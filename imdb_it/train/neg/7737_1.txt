Who in the world told Harrison Ford that this was a good role for him ??? <br /> <br /> And Josh Hartnett ... how does a 19-year-old who can't shoot a gun become a cop? The clich√©s used beyond the development of zero characters and about 15 cameos of the nonsensical music industry amount to a surprisingly bad film !!!
