I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Memoirs of Geisha turns out to be yet another failure to fight the Western and Asian arts. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after a marked emphasis on exotic-oriented scenes, some may find themselves tired of them. The excessive flowering of the cherry trees was, frankly, exaggerated. It is probably the cultural difference of perception here: the final beauty is not the flashy type, since the really beautiful geisha would not be the pumpkin too westernized in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly mentioned the major flaws. As a Taiwanese, I have no doubt that the actress is fantastic. An actor / actress can play any kind of role when he can look like him. Gong Li is fantastic, but the power of emotions he showed in this film was not translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a Chinese bittersweet and jealous Chinese. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actresses, didn't even look like a Japanese. Some comments have mentioned the peculiar delicate feminine characteristics of Japanese women, with whom I can no longer agree. They are so delicate that I assume that not even all the modern Japanese actresses are fit for the roles in Geisha, not to mention the two Chinese and one Malaysian actresses who grew up in different cultures and probably didn't know much about Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good opportunity to arouse the curiosity of the American public. But it would be an insult to the film itself and to art in the same way if the film wins the Oscar for best costume, best director or best film.
