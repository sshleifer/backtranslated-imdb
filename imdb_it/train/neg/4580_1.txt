I'm still trying to decide if this is really the worst movie I've ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this film is that the real scientists are interviewed, but their movie has been modified to make it look like they support the ideas of many BSers that populate this film. The BS report to report the interviews is about ten thousand to one - in the end, the interviewees seem to say: "We want you to do _think_ !!", but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research on things they claim as fact. <br /> <br /> If you think you are open minded and want to expand your consciousness, please be open enough to read some books on quantum theory: "Einstein's universe", Nigel Calder (a thin book , not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code", by Heinz Pagels. If you can't read a book, please don't complain to reviewers about being "open-minded". <br /> <br /> To sum up, this film is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Do you know what a really beautiful film that questions the nature of reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio. Smart, sexy, stimulating.
