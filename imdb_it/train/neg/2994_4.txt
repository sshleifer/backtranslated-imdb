I've seen this movie twice and I have to say I liked it both times. It's fast and fun, but ultimately stupid. That said, it deserves to be trashed for ruining what could have been a good sequel to the original. It is clear for those who have seen the horrible 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the film can be attributed enormous deficiencies to Bruno Mattei, and that the small that is commendable about it may be due to Fulci. This is not the least fulciicismo of Fulci, the styles of directors are strongly contrasting, and you can tell who has direct thing, in particular in the case of Mattei. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the outbreak of a virus (strangely referred to as a "top secret" of a scientist, is the apparently most noteworthy secrecy of its potentially apocalyptic effect on humanity) somewhere in South East Asia. The virus causes behavior similar to that of zombies in those affected and the virus spreads rapidly in an apparently arbitrary area. Our protagonists are involuntarily wandering around the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be stuck halfway between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out of action adventure, and this confusion is captured more clearly by the zombies themselves. They don't seem to have a set of features common to all. Some are of the regular soulless mixture, so well rendered in the original, and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consists of those who lost their sense of self in being infected by the virus, but suffered a fierce aggression and the desire to gain a black belt in ninjitsu: undecided uncertain leaps whether to continue to perfect the Upper roundhouse technique or engage with their siblings in what looks like a massive tickling party on their unfortunate victims. Even the skills in martial arts are not their only qualities, they are well versed in guerrilla tactics, they hide on beams and under bales of hay and, sometimes inexplicably, they fall from nothing, if not the skies themselves. This is certainly Mattei's work. <br /> <br /> There is a third, more talkative, variety of zombies. Apparently this type also retains a sense of irony "I am really thirsty ... FOR YOUR BLOOD". The ridiculous twist at the end when the DJ becomes a zombie but continues to preach in free words about the fate of humanity, only serves to improve the WTF factor and erase all hope of a serious resolution. <br /> <br /> So there is the infamous zombie head that is slowly spreading in the air, a playful skeletal sneer on the face, as if to say "Yes, we know how bad this aspect is". <br /> <br /> The characters are all absolutely one dimensional as you would expect. But it is pseudo-comic dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their situation seriously. That said, the first soldier who dies puts on an impressive and valiant show against an unstoppable zombie threat. In fact, this is the first and perhaps the only time we have come across a real zombie in the countryside, and one of the only effective scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> The boy who played the chief scientist has a heart, but no talent, using pauses in his lines entirely by chance, so he ends up looking like a confused asthmatic. Scientists' attempts to find an antidote on the screen are not entirely convincing "now let's put these two molecules together!" <br /> <br /> There are some moments that remain truly effective. In one of the first scenes a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Entering a room we find ourselves in front of a confused vision of a changing figure in the corner and a mass that writhes on the floor, all projected in a diffused and atmospheric light. Silence is interrupted by the appearance of a zombie wielding a fast machete that destroys everything in its wake in its alarming desperation to have it. Its sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The theme before and after transmitted through the hotel that hosts the events of the first stage of the epidemic, and later as a refuge for our protagonists is imbued with a dense humid atmosphere. There is a scene where one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a room with boards that clearly houses hordes of undead, and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board the hotel without knowing what is hiding upstairs. But this is handled carelessly and is not as effective as it could have been. <br /> <br /> All in all I would say that this film could deserve to be called a real bug in a potentially effective tropical zombie festival, rather than just a bad movie. If nothing else it has many involuntary laughs that I expected from all that is Italian and bloody of the eighties.
