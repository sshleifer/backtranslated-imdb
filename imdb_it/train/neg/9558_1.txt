I thought this was a sequel of some kind, and it's going to be original since 1983. But a sequel isn't taking the original plot and destroys it. <br /> <br /> Actually I had very little expectations for this film, but I just wasted 95 minutes of life. No suspense - In fact I feel clairvoyant, poor acting, and so full of technical errors, so I as a computer geek couldn't believe it. They tried to make a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours. But this is not even worthy of a low-budget TV movie. <br /> <br /> Not seeing this movie, this is a complete waste of time. Instead you get the original. The theme is still valid. Do not let too much energy enter a car. And the acting and the plot are much more exciting and exciting.
