This film is one of the unintentionally bad action films ever made. Dolph Friggin 'Lundren with a Japanese accent is quite fun, but adds a mix of buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and exaggerated baddie, a subplot of clich√© love interests and one of the worst endings of all time, and you you made a small suicidal cure for people who love their lives and, until they saw "Showdown", they never thought of killing themselves with a blowtorch. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's just me, but the entire homosexual subtext is not too thin. There are constant references to male genitals, and not to females, either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about the manly parts of each other, and in fact, before starting a suicide sentence, Brandon tells Dolphy: "In case we can't make it, I want to tell you, you have the biggest d --- I've ever seen. "<br /> <br /> Now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION film, nothing less? And would you like them to be your dead words? <br /> <br /> Next, there is this gem: <br /> <br /> Dolph (about the villain): "I would like to cut some parts of his anatomy." Brandon: "Friend, you have a fixation" . <br /> <br /> As the guy from RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, "Unfortunately, Dolph does not answer," Do I have a fixation? I have a fixation?! You are the one who decided that his last words should concern my friends! I was just about to cut his ears and nose, man. "<br /> <br /> This is inexorably stupid and very funny stuff if you are a person who likes to receive root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain. It's almost on par. Great fun for the whole family!
