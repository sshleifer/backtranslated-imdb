Tromaville High has become a filthy amoral heath thanks to the consequences of the accidental release of toxic waste from the nearby nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> Unbridled chaos full of absurd violence and cruel behavior. Quite horrible, obviously destined to be, confusion of a film with the directors taking the reins off allowing the cast without audition to reign free. Craft was at the bottom of Troma's list of targets for this bloody fist fight. The society of honor is punk with disturbing face painting jobs and extravagant clothes. The German teacher who becomes a member through a "toxic kiss" has stripes along one side of her face that really made me shudder. The toxic monster, who sent the PUNKI ANCHORS towards the end, is quite nice, though. br /> <br /> kind of junk movie connoisseurs will embrace wholeheartedly.
