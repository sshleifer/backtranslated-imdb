This movie is so ugly that you feel almost contaminated by it. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and bring it back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of movie in which William Hurt would "call" his performance. I meant that he wouldn't try very hard. But here, in a huge number of scenes in this film, Bill Hurt is actually ON THE PHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure derived from this confused mess. Cinematography and editing are obscure and confused, the plot is chaotic and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a slight resemblance to "Falling Down", but that film has a bravely disturbing plot, writing and acting, and an engaging soundtrack. "The contaminated man" is just a kind of old trap for European tourists, and observing it is like driving on an unknown secondary road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in constant rain just after night while the windshield continues fogging. Do you have the image? I don't understand this.
