I went into this hoping it would be the "inspiring" little gem that people have reviewed as. i love indy movies and i expect to dig that too. knowing what hot topic this topic is I expected to be entertained, maybe even to see an outsider perspective. <br /> <br /> all I can say is wow .... if you are in self-torture, or mutilate then maybe you will like this. I personally don't like the idea of ​​being pissed or cutting myself so I thought it was garbage. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad direction, bad touches ... I could go on. I have no idea why a reviewer claimed he was making a political point by giving this movie a 10. It's misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb is not creating a precedent! simply let others think that a garbage bomb like this is OK to look at until it's controversial (this movie is not, it looks VERY HARD to be but it fails). <br /> <br /> you know the film is ugly when you start praying at 15 minutes that all the main characters die horribly. unfortunately they die, but not in the painful ways that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having seen the 2 hours of shit they just endured. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't even worry. I got this movie in a business basket in my local video store for 0.50 and I feel screwed!
