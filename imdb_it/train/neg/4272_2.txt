This type of film in which a psychopath of one or the other variety tries to damage the reputation (and in the end eliminates it completely) a naive person to take possession of his life. Fatal attraction, Pacific Heights, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Single White Female and a thousand movies made for TV are some examples of this. But while some, especially Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights, could offer at least some extremely suspicious or paranoid characters, or some twists and turns, Unlawful Entry plays everything according to the book. And if it weren't for the fame of his stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this film would have sunk to mediocrity faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessant naive boy who asks for help from a couple of officers when someone breaks into his home and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he silently vents his anger to feel so helpless in the situation with the wrong cop (Ray Liotta), a typical psychopathic criminal with no limits to his power. Initially empathizing with Carr (probably just pretending to do it), the policeman befriends the couple. But soon enough, the cops want Carr to get out of the way, destroying kids' lives almost in every way possible (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who installed the boy's security system in the his house) to take over and presumably take his wife. He seems less end-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to show his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. And the story takes place entirely in the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these films. From the "shocking" moment our naive main character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the evil psychopath) to the end of the turn-around-he's-not-dead-dead.
