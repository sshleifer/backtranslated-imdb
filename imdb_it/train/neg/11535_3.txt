Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, guided, career woman who picks up the working class oath Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the country, they are brutally attacked. After recovering and after a chance encounter with one of the attackers, their thoughts turn into revenge ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Straightheads" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I didn't like the phrase a lot, I would call "Straightheads" a bad video. Surely it was the kind of film that would have had a budget-free publication directly in the videos during the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I don't know how "Straightheads" got a film release. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I don't care about sex and violence in movies, but they must be married to a film with a) a good storyline or b) a good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" had neither no progression in the plot or in the characters and too much left unexplained and unspoken. Fortunately "Straightheads" didn't go anywhere fast. It was only 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was a pity, because there was the germ of an interesting film here, with a particularly interesting turn in the plot in the last third. How often I say this, but it could have been fine if it was done correctly. What a pity. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they didn't hide anything with this film. She, in particular, is very undervalued (and is still particularly fit). <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy "Dead Man's Shoes" by Shane Meadows. It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his "This Is England" instead. There evening evening ...
