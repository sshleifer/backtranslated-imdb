This film is all flash and without a soul. Actors gave a lot of passion to numbers, but these numbers often didn't connect with the movie and felt like independent music videos. And no effort has been made to make the numbers look like they were happening right there in front of you, each one sounds like it came from a studio, essentially sucking all the life from the songs. Offstage the performances were all boring and unfeasible, in particular Hudson, who essentially plays the same angry, "strong" black woman (he is stubborn and selfish) that we have seen before. There was absolutely no depth in his character, nor in any of the other women. Even though I think the film wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces difficulties because of her weight, it is her refusal to do what is best for the team that gets her in trouble, making the end of the film totally devoid of meaning. Hudson's Academy Award is a joke, there was no justification. When he sang, he emitted emotions (although he was often out of place, but this was the fault of the writer / director), but when he acted, he did nothing to confer an already signed character. The character of Eddie Murphy is the only one with a bow, and he did a great job, but he is not yet a worthy Oscar. The only actor who really brought something to the launch was Danny Glover, who took a small, relatively unimportant character and made something real. There's nothing here to sink your teeth into, no dramas or hearts, or even laughter. The placement of the musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the movie seemed almost to mock musicals instead of being one; the number in which Hudson is discussing with the other girls is so long-winded that if it was still past it could pass for a parody of Family Guy. The film has no idea what it is and I felt insulted in the last few minutes. It's a big, boring waste of time, and it's really the worst movie I saw in 2006, and nothing was really stellar to begin with last year.
