I saw this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this film enjoyable. The only reason I saw it until the end is because I teach video production and I wanted to make sure that my students had never done anything so bad ... but it took all my strength. intestinal. It's like watching your great-grandmother flirt with a 15-year-old boy ... terribly painful. <br /> <br /> If you took the actual movie, you dipped it in thinner, then looked at it, it would have been more fun. Jokes aside. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the trash can of the S-Mart bar, go back as if it were a rattlesnake.
