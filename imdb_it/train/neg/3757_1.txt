Why did this come to light? Generally I love F / Bigfoot skiing, any film, etc. . but I still expect them to be written without much cheese like this. The effects were sad, the lines were sadder. Avoid at all costs. I ended up renting it just because it was in the wrong case (I was looking for the Sasquatch movie with Lance Henrikson inside it - I still haven't seen it). The idea of ​​the film is actually a good idea. There was great potential to make a great little movie here. I simply don't understand how such a thing ends up like this. Go talk to the film / arts / interested students in English at any high school and you will find people who can write a better script.
