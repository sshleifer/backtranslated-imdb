You should know that I am the kind of person who watches the worst movie to the end, often out of sheer morbid curiosity. I even looked at Leprechaun to the end before succumbing to the temptation to tear my eyes and step on them. You should also know that this movie was in my VCR for less than half an hour before I made a wild leap to the stop button and jumped back into the rental store just to put as much distance as possible between him and me.
