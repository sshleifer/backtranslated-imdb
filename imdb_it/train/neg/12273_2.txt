PIANO B has the appearance of a fast, unpublished, sloppy script for a film with the attempt of a trip for the actors involved - a trip that should have been nixed from the beginning. It's just another mafia-based comedy that has nothing new and lowers the standard for the participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the head of the crime most concerned about clothing and appearances rather than his control activity. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is more stupid than filth and his ignorance should be fun. Maloni beat one of his debtors (who has just been married to bookmaker Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran as his assistant to compensate for the debt of her dead husband being the "killer" of Maloni. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to complete Maloni's homework, instead electing to carry her "whales" to Florida to hide in her brother James's house until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! The ending is completely predictable as is any line assigned to the characters in the script. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many beautiful films and is one of our most talented actresses and comedians, but here she screams and makes a face and makes her way into a ridiculous part that becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino cast of other mafia films. Similarly, the supporting cast can play on the balcony with the widest and most bizarre fashion imaginable. What should be a comedy ends up being simply silly and exaggerated. Director Greg Yaitanes must return to television sitcoms: it was compressed in half an hour that he could have a chance.
