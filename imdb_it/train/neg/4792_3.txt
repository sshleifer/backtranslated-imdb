Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... fantastic. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would like to remain faithful to this film, I simply can't. The film seems to have "run out". The first negative signals come when the video has trailers for other films at the beginning (something that others haven't done). Even too many useless characters, the first examples the boy (who is a shot, initially funny but soon want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight the balls (he won't work, or rather he shouldn't) and the zombies in bloom hell they do there, there is no connection with them in the other Phatasms). Also there is a serious lack of running midget. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILER coming) <br /> <br /> For me this film looks like a stucco between II and IV, since the extra characters leave at the end, so it can continue with the 4 main ones in IV. <br /> <br /> Overall very, VERY disappointing. 3/10
