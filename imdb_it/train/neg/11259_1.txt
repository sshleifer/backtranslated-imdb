I gave 1 to this movie. I don't understand how Ettore Scola, one of the greatest directors of Italian cinema, has made such a stupid and ridiculous film! All the stories of the people involved in the film are inconsistent, boring and uninteresting. Too long, too boring. The only things I save in this film are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola radically changes themes and style in his next film.
