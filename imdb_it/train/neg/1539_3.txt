I'm a big fan of westerns but this .... whew, what a stink! I think what made me almost crazy was the absurd dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this terrible dialogue, none of them came across something far from ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Some things are slightly better than you would get in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. It was probably the "big" star in this movie that, if you called him B-Western, you would have praised him. This is what should be called a Western B-less perhaps. Pity Sterling Hayden, who has appeared on other occasions alongside Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. For him to appear in a vehicle this poor man must have been something he tried to minimize for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> One annoying thing about this movie is that all the men don't seem to have shaved a week and their faces are all greasy. I know that in the old West the boys weren't always well taken care of, but for a man this is a movie that makes you want to go 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a poor western. Even Denver Pyle had to live this experience, especially after appearances in so many great westerns. Bad, bad movie.
