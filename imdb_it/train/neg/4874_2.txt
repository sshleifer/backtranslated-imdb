Too bad that neither the animals nor Eddie Murphy had anything to say. this film is simply bland. <br /> <br /> Children's movies? Well, if you're trying to make them take a nap, then maybe. It's only 90 minutes of a labial animation of laboriousness for lips that are not fun. And the lip-sync'ing makes the old Godzilla movies look like compared. Meanwhile, Eddie "Pluto Nash" Murphy continues to stand up with an understated submission that is painful to try. Apparently, he's trying to change his old manic character, but what? In short, all the magic and wonder of the original 1967 version is lost in this re-imagination, or whatever it is. A city wants to target some forest creatures and blame them for doing bad things. No, really. And Pluto Nash can exchange small talk with them. Things go hand in hand with some stale jokes at a boring conclusion without inspiration without surprises. <br /> <br /> Rent the '67 movie. Or some old Yogi Bear cartoons.
