This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival, although for better reasons left to power. Much seems to have been made of the fact that it is the first film in Thai, made with Thai actors and troupes, but directed by a westerner. There was no need to worry about being honest, as this film is boring, boring, boring. Why hint at something, why wrap an idea in mystery, why subtly invoke a feeling, when you can hammer the point home with terrible voices in over, obvious hits and scenes at the top of the page> Nothing is left to the imagination anymore and repeatedly Spurrier director clumsily churns out endless clich√©s. No hint, no supposition, everything is on the screen, no need to use our imagination. I wonder when the "scary" piece will arrive? No, you won't, because the soundtrack will become more and more intimidating, becoming a threatening crescendo. Hell, I'm making up words to describe how bad this is. I wonder if the summoned demon is real or imaginary? Why tax yourself - it's really a snake, and yes it's really biting his horse, and there's blood splattering everywhere. it is a strange film, restless for several reasons. It should be a horror movie, but it's not scary - the jolts are marked and obvious. It could be a harsh attack on the most terrifying side of Thailand, yet the director has a squalid, lubricating style when it comes to barely showing adolescent puberty. Perhaps it was the virginity that the Westerner took that had planted the seeds of doubt in my head. Or maybe it was all just pants. Tasteless, tasteless, repetitive, banal - all candidates for the best description, but boring seems the most appropriate and honest. It has already been seen before, probably better, often with more thoughts, rarely with less imagination or flare. Sorry. Thumbs down on each count. Really terrible.
