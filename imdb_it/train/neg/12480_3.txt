... Or, more precisely, so badly that you will have the time of your life laughing out loud when you look at it! The "Deathstalker" by James Sbardellati of 1983 is certainly one of the most horrible productions that the subgenus Sword & Sorcery has carried out, but it is very funny. The acting is terrible, the plot is pure shit and the effects and photography could not be more amateur. But it's the bad acting, the cheese effects and many mistakes that make this movie so funny. <br /> <br /> - SPOILERS AHEAD - <br /> <br /> Deathstalker (Rick Hill) is an extremely strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch will commission him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation, a sword, an amulet and a chalice, in order to free the country from its brutal sovereign, the evil king and magician Munkar. Getting the sword is easy enough, but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar's possession. Fortunately, the evil king has organized a tournament in which the most skilled warriors in the county fight each other to the death. The winner is therefore to take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he plans to kill the winner (instead of not organizing the tournament in the first place). Deathstalker is not only to get the three powers of creation, but also to save the beautiful daughter of the old king (Barbi Benton) from the claws of the evil Munkar. Fortunately, he is not bored on his way to the tournament, since he was allowed to throw the beautiful female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) in the meantime ... <br /> <br /> The film has many great, incredibly silly and funny scenes. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deathstalker beheads a bad boy with his sword. The falling head, however, is not that boy's head. The falling head has a red goatee, while the boy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and a beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of the female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is presented, she is seen for the first time in a black robe, which hides her face and body. Travel companion Deathstalker Oghris (Richard Brooker) fights her, and during the sword fight his tunic (under which he is, of course, topless) opens, exposing his breasts. Her breast is the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last warrior Deathstalker must fight in the tournament, he is a giant boy with a man's body and a pig's head. <br /> <br /> - The evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a box. He feeds that little human with balls and eyes. <br /> <br /> ... There are many other scenes that are unintentionally funny, hilarious and grandiose. The acting is terrible, but Barbi Benton and the deceased Lana Clarkson are real eye candy, and although he described this film as "unintentionally funny", I sometimes got the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how gross the film is. There is a good dose of blood, and a lot of female nudity to entertain the viewer. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly terrible film, but I highly recommend it. People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives!
