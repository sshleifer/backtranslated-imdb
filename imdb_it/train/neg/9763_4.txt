Bestselling writer George Plimpton (Alan Alda) takes on an assignment for Sports Illustrated. He must go incognito to the Detroit Lions training camp and try to take a position as quarterback of the third series. He was soon discovered by team members with Alex Karras and Mike Lucci. The whole team finds it fun to create blocks in the writer's determination to quarterback for a series in a real game. <br /> <br /> This film is Alda's debut and has also helped Karras leave the grid to act. In addition to the 1968 Detroit Lions, the cast also includes "Sugar Ray" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton. <br /> <br /> Alex March directs this story based on the book by Plimton.
