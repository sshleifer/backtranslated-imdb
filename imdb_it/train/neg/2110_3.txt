Now I adore Bela Lugosi, don't get me wrong, he's one of the most interesting people who ever made a film, but he certainly did his part as clunkers. This is just another one of those. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz, a doctor who had his medical license for unexplained reasons. He does however experiment to keep his wife young and beautiful. He revealed that he is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in his mid-50s, so because he is married to this old woman, he is never really explained. <br /> <br /> In any case, these treatments or experiments consisted in giving the brides who find themselves at the altar a sort of sweet-smelling substance for which they pass out but it is thought to be dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body while they go to the morgue and take him to his laboratory where he is held in a sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then the stolen brides have a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies, perhaps the neck, and then the needle is rammed into the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never see where Lugosi glues the needle or what he pulls out of the brides but somehow restores his wife. Old age, apparently, makes you scream in pain because Lugosi's wife makes a lot of screaming until he returns to his younger state. Helping Lugosi in his workshop is the only good thing about this film .... a bizarre old witch and her two deformed sons ... a son is a big, slow-looking, slow-looking guy who likes to caress the sleepy brides and the other son is a small petty dwarf .... small person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night these three crowd around and sleep in the lugubrious Lugosi laboratory downstairs. Who these three are and how they became Lugosi's frightened assistants is, like a lot of things in this film, never explained. <br /> <br /> So every female journalist is assigned the task by her surly editor to find out where all the brides stolen from a common thing among all the stolen brides will end up is a rare orchid found on their. So she asks around and is told that there is a world-renowned orchid expert who lives nearby that seems to be the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be creepy Dr.Lorenz. He follows him quickly and upsets his house of horrors. I'm not sure where the police were during all this, but they came to clean when the reporter did everything <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugosi's films have always had some sort of useless plot line that has made the whole thing stinky to the heavens. I mean, a world-famous orchid expert abducts brides by sending them an orchid addict whom he himself is known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it is revealed that the young ladies should not even be brides for the work procedure, so why Lugosi continues to kidnap brides from the highly guarded churches for his experiments and create all the titles of attention and newspaper? Why not take a prostitute from the street like a normal pervert would do? This clunker reminded me of a lot of another stinky Lugosi, "The Devil Bat" .... the same silly plot lines and bad acting and the same silly "reporter are treated as a bad man". <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - it's scary and sinister enough to keep you interested enough to keep looking at it. The woman who plays the journalist was just a terrible actor ... she had no emotion, she had just uttered her lines like a machine gun, spewing them out as quickly as possible. Everybody else practically blew him too, when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing is watchable, even if only for fans of Bela Lugosi.Lugosi was always so intense even when the photo was a dog. He had to know that he was taking terrible pictures but maybe he also knew that if he gave everything he had a bit of that intensity he could shine through all the bad plots and bad deeds that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi. He gave her his every And he was facing the camera. We give him two f ** ks for you, Bela.
