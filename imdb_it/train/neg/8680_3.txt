I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. Actually, the only thing that kept me from looking was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY ugly, it was kind of entertainment. The action of the characters is exhilarating, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall to gunshots, to their incredibly bad acting (were the bad guys all just out of the street, or were they actually actors?), To an incredibly bad delivery of lines, to their inexplicable actions (if you're going to try to shoot someone through a door as they enter, of course the thing to do is fire directly at the door handle !!). This film must break some records for the worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> Even the work with the camera was bad: you can hardly see what happens in the fight scenes due to the change of angle and camera shake. /> <br /> I would have voted "1", except I like Chiba and the sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I've been entertained by a couple of scenes: 1) a bad guy's arm broken so the bone comes out of the skin (this is to be hurt) 2) a drug boss who eats a brown-haired animal (a monkey ??) by cutting the carcass with a meat cleaver 3) Sonny Chiba performs an impromptu surgical operation on a boy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm really a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this really isn't worth anyone's time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones that are worth watching (and they're fantastic!) Are the Street Fighter and The Killing Machine series. I also heard that the Executioner and the Golgo 13 are good. Council to stick to those.
