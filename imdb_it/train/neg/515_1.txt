Oh man is this bad movie. It runs horribly The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself, and therefore has to promote a chicken fast food chain and, while doing so, does not love himself. Try to get out of the contract and horrible and painful gags ensue. Jim Nabors looks like he is a sleepwalker, not acting. You'll miss these Burt buddies like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while you watch this stinker. Loni Anderson's hair is definitely scary, demonstrating that tons of hairspray didn't come out in the 1960s. Or maybe it was a wig. By the way, Burt's wig wasn't bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and the Bandit 2". However, this film is the worst Reynolds movie ever seen with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" which, fortunately, have not been followed) are great and funny films. This is not. Ned Beatty, who is a great actor, also stinks. A bad guy like Jackie Gleason will be waiting for you and it's fun to hate. And mind you, this is not one of those funny movies to wear. It's bad, pure and simple. Even the outtakes were boring and boring in the end, and worse, they weren't funny. And less than I forget, "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt's coffin before waking up years later in "Boogie Nights", another film that, as "Deliverance" years before, shows that the man can act quite well when he has a decent platform to do it.
