The only reason I gave a 1 out of 10 is because the option to assign zeroes to 10 was not allowed. This was the biggest waste of time I've ever endured. For about 75 minutes, you are subjected to the acting of WORSE (and I do not mean this too in a good way, as in KILLER NERD who played in a horrible way) and a plot that is not only ridiculous but also has absolutely nothing to do with a massacre. The reason I even rented this piece of shit is because he had a massacre in the title. That being said, there was only one murder in the whole film and it was rather boring. You spend more time looking at the kids fighting and doing garden work than anything else. Speaking of children, the child actor is probably the most irritating actor since Bob is at home in the cemetery. Did I mention that it was also shot on video? If you want to throw away money and more than an hour of your life, then look at it by all means. But if you savor your hard dollars and time, move as far away as possible.
