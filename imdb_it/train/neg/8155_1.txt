Actually I prefer Robin Williams in his most serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, The World According to Garp). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. But Seize the Day, although well performed, is one of the worst films I've ever seen and certainly the worst Robin Williams movie (even worse than Death to Smoochy, Club Paradise and Alladin on Ice). <br /> <br /> Every good story will have its ups and downs. This film, however, is one less giant. I don't need a festive Hollywood festival, but I have to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter despair. This film reminds me of "Love Liza" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point of the film is to see how far a person can fall. The answer? Who cares.
