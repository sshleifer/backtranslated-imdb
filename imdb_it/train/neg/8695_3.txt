Elizabeth Rohm was the weakest actress in all of the ADAs of Law and Order and her acting is even worse. His attempts at Texan accent are amateur and unrealistic. Nor can he adequately recall the intense emotions needed to interpret the mother of a kidnapped child; sometimes, while his daughter misses, he can only seem vaguely annoyed, as if he can't remember where he left his keys. <br /> <br /> This is a truly important story, so it's a pity that the horrible acting of the main actress distracts so much from the message. The rest of the cast is quite talented, but they just can't overcome Rohm's tendency to simply put a particularly thick imitation of a Southern drawl whenever acting is needed.
