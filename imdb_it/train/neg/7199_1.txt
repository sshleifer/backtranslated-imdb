Why?!! This was a bland, uninspired and embarrassing film. The embarrassment comes from being in the city where they made it ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did they let these people make a BAAAAD movie there? <br /> <br /> When this film was originally released ... it was more a romantic comedy ... and no ROBO-nothing. Everything has changed with the courtesy of Disney. WHY???? They made a terrible interpretation of this classic comic character. Even seeing Matthew Broderick making fun of his films was not fun. Sheesh !!
