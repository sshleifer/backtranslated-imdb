Not that I am delighted at the sight of a bloodshed realist, but when I put a DVD waiting for a bloodbath, and what I get is a bloody scene (the eyeball) at the end of a false asinine slap which runs inside a desk chair, I end up thinking "well, it's 43 minutes of my life gone forever". I would not consider this or "film" of Flower of Flesh and Blood as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of Flesh and Blood had some difficult points to watch. Devil's experiment no. It was at best, stupid and at worst ... well ... really stupid. Perhaps my expectation was too high. I put the DVD thinking "oh man, this will be sick." After seeing them fake the girl about a thousand times, I was looking forward quickly. <br /> <br /> Two types of people would be interested in this film. 1) People looking for successful movies just to see how F'd up really is, or 2) more complete horror. I looked for this and other films of Guinea Pig for the last reason, but even if I fell into the category of the first, this film would not have floated my boat. In fact, I could imagine this film that increases the desire for blood ... as in "YOU'LL JUST KILL THE B * TCH ALREADY !!" So in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes. If you want the carnage that traditional horror does not provide, take Traces of Death. Sure, this sucks, but at least you'll have the blood and guts you expect. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can see someone praising this crap is because they feel they should do it. No artistic merit that I can understand, no reason for its fame, nothing at all. Only a lame attempt to be shocking.
