Visually cluttered, less plot, incredibly senseless garbage. Not even close to Greenaway's best work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping effects of the "split screen" do nothing but confuse, the film is very dark most of the time and the "artistic" composition of the images is pretentious to the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; nudity is also incredibly unerotic, which, seeing that it fills most of the film, soon becomes boring. <br /> <br /> Also, how anyone can say that Ewen MacGregor's acting is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more skills in the Star Wars series, and this is saying something. <br /> <br /> I haven't been so impressed with a movie since I saw "Darby O'Gill and the Little People"!
