I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my life, a lot, but this is without a doubt the worst ever! I usually like stupid movies, if they're a little funny, but I can't even think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for heaven's sake. But S.I.C.K. has a horrible acting, limping music for the whole thing and even the sex scenes are sucked in! I should compare the limp of this movie with characters like "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs the Demonic Toys" or "Very Brady Sequel". Although, this is far worse than those. Please don't waste time. Believe me, his 2 hours will never come back.
