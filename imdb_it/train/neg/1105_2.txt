Oh my. How can they make films of such beauty, but they are so terribly bad. I mean, even Uwe Boll doesn't suck like this. There is not even a hint of a decent story, layered characters or attraction. It's just a random sequence of useless chatter combined to make a "movie". I suppose that only children up to 3 years can enjoy it, since the world is so completely devoid of size and the story so incoherent, that anyone will be annoyed. But then again, it's too scary for anyone under the age of 6, who probably doesn't have anyone to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and stay away, far away from this movie. Your little daughter can make a better storyline, and even if she's probably not able to draw this picture, her stories deserve much more listening. And please, in the name of whoever you believe, don't expose your children to this piece of ****. I will give 2 out of 10, and this is exclusively for graphics, because the character's story and development are so terrible that they deserve a negative evaluation. <br /> <br /> And if you decide to look at it anyway ... remember that I warned you.
