I'm happy to see that most other people here don't think much about this movie. He has some big names in the cast, but that's it. There is nothing else to recommend if you look at the pretty women you can do in a thousand movies. <br /> <br /> The plot does not imply anything but unlikely, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters that all national film critics all seem to ... and most of the public can't stand. <br /> <br /> The accents of Oklahoma are so fake that they are ridiculous, the racist stereotypes of the south are precisely Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing.
