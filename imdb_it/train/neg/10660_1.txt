Too bad that people call kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood! comeon guys..this film is an emotionless thriller .. <br /> <br /> Step out of your ulagam and watch only some high-class thrillers like The Usual Suspects or even The Silence of the Lambs. <br /> technically good but style on substance kamal does not look like a police officer, there is no thrill that you drag and you get bored until the end you could save 3 precious hours of your life if you jump to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> kamal at its best is the best of tollywood
