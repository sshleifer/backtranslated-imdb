I should love this movie. The acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is fantastic but the film always seemed very trivial to me. the film makes working-class people low and cheap. The fact that her daughter is ashamed of her mother and that her daughter doesn't get on it has always made me a little uncomfortable. Barbara Stanwyck as her mother loves her daughter but her daughter gives up a mother who loves finding happiness with her wealthy family. I wonder how many others who have seen this film feel this way. The acting was very good and worth watching. I don't really like the plot. just a personal preference. Thank you
