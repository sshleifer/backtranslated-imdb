RUN ... don't leave this movie !!!!! For the very young children, this film will bore you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy of the 1990s raised the bar, this film simply lowered it. It has a slow pace and monster fighting is good, but rarely seen. This film made me feel panting in the cat box. Only a very poor offer after a phenomenal series of the 90s. <br /> <br /> SPOILER BEYOND THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons why Gamera fans in the 90s series will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a drama that follows a child who tries to face the death of his mother and is afraid of having lost the little Gamera in combat after knowing that his father saw the adult Gamera die . <br /> <br /> 9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film. He gets kicked by some Gyaos and self-destructing ??? It looks old and lethargic. It also doesn't look like any of the gamers you've ever seen. His suit seemed cheap and hasty. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon. With big and cute eyes ... it will remind you of the little Godzilla of Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too cute. <br /> <br /> 7. This film has the rhythm of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I saw this movie with two other Gamera fans and no one was happy about how slowly this film moved. I saw an SUV full of fat people getting on a mountain road to move faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this film has had very little time on screen. Final Wars has had much more, actually, and fights better though short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the lead role. The theme of the friend of all children and bad writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s and the story repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera films have abandoned the sensation of Sesame Street and have gone into darkest place. Why go back to a failed formula? This was supposed to be a new trilogy and shoddy ticket sales killed any hope that this story would continue (thank God). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera has lost its iconic roar. Now it sounds like an elephant with a sore throat. <br /> <br /> 3. This film could produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children in danger. You must see the ending to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yes ... it's okay to send their kids to a kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good, but not comparable to a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris have had better effects. The best effect was to show the Apple-sized Gamera fly. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This film is not what adult kaiju fans expect. The director was involved in Power Rangers and shows. It comes off as a cross between ET, Always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Congratulations if you know all 3 references. <br /> <br /> Hire the best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
