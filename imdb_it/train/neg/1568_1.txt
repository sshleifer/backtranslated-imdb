Calling it anything would be an insult to everything else. Some curses could describe it, but still too positively. Normally this type of garbage is ignored, but it was so stupid that one can only despair. I would have thought, however, that even the Americans and commercial television broadcasters would have given this piece certainly a lack. But as the Germans say: Gegen die Dummheit kaempfen die Goetter selbst Vergebens!
