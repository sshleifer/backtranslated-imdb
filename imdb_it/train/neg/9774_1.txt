Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the screenplay for Aronofsky's film. That film was successful at every level offering an intimate and impartial portrait of the horrors of the lives of the characters and the vices that destroyed them. "Last Exit To Brooklyn" still has the vice and multiple characters who live sad lives, but barely does them the same justice that Aronofsky did. <br /> <br /> The film sometimes seems ridiculous anti-gay. Especially when homosexuality is equal to death in the film. A gay character is stoned to death, thrown into the sky from a racing car and lands dead on the pavement. Another is crucified and others are simply beaten. Another exaggerated value of shock, which in reality would have been convincing had it been done well, are the scenes of union workers who are literally fighting with strikes. Who would have thought that a drama about Brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel has a skill level like that of a television director, but he is far below the real movie cut. The film is clumsy that doesn't even seem to fit into a genre. Lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and Baldwin just seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part. And then comes Jennifer Jason Leigh as the protagonist, a nasty prostitute named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not kidding). His performance is nothing special and the fate of his character is nothing short of dirty. The low use of color and composition makes it seem cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" advantage of the more provocative bits. A failure.
