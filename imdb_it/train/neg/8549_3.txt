Okay, what the hell was TRASH looking at now? "The Witches' Mountain" must be one of the most inconsistent and insane of Spanish exploitative gestures yet yet, at the same time, it is also strangely compelling. There is absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt that there was ever a script to work with, but somehow I couldn't turn it off. The scratching of the head with confusion starts immediately, with an opening sequence on an angry little girl who killed her mother's cat. So do you think this film revolves around children possessed by evil forces? Hell no, because after this introduction, the girl and her wickedness simply are no longer mentioned. Then cut yourself to a boy, with the most extraordinarily well-groomed mustache you have ever seen, which he breaks with his girlfriend in a rather null way. When she asks him to spend his holidays with her, he quickly calls his employer asking him for any kind of job! Great move. The film finally begins now, as he travels to an isolated mountainous area to photograph some peaks. Although not before he picks up a new girl (Patty Shepard) and takes topless pictures of her! During their journey, do all these strange events occur? you guessed ?? they are never explained The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, petrifying music sounds everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! Really, carjacking witches? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and practices voodoo on offenders. It's so close to how I describe the plot, but is there a good chance I'm far? More important here is the atmosphere! "The Witches' Mountain" is sometimes very disturbing, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography. The supporting characters all seem disturbing and the seductive Patty Shepard plays a good heroine. This is the kind of European horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured script.
