I couldn't wait to see him, as I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. Then he quickly jumps to the main plot, which is attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer is badly beaten while Anderson is raped. So they decide to take revenge. Looks good, right? Well, it's not. The story becomes boring and traced, and some things get really weird. I won't give any details, but things happen that I, for example, don't want to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this. It did not work. I give him a 3 out of 10, mainly for acting.
