This is the biggest piece of shit ever. They seem to have spent more time, effort and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie. I really thought the DVD had been replaced with somebody's homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors on the cover. This film looks like someone made it with a hundred dollars and a video camera and spent half of it on mice. The image is very clear, but that, together with the unfortunate lighting, the cinematography, if it is possible to call it that, the production, the acting, if it is actually what they are doing and the script, if they have one, it makes it look like this movie worse than old porn. At least the old porn is right. It seems that some members of PETA have come together and decided to create a truly disturbing and useless PSA on the rights and feelings of animals. This is not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with the current BTK serial killer in addition to the name of the killer and that of some of the victims. The people who made this film should be happy not to be free yet, or could have come after them just for ruining this film so badly.
