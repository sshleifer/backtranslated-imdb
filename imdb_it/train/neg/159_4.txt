I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life and for her talents as an actor. This is why I found it strange that she appeared in a film that distorted the facts so much. The rescue of his character from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company in Edmonton, Alberta, which flew over a Twin Otter aircraft designed and built in Canada. The journey was rejected by the United States as Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. The same company organized a similar rescue a few years later to get a man out of the South Pole base. I feel the film was a very compelling subject and documented a very brave woman who faced a daunting task. I can't understand why the producers would have thought it necessary to ignore the courage of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as a Hercules USAF.
