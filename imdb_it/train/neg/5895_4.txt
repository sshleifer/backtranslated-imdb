Does Miike like Chabrol, who alternates art with dreck, sometimes confusing the two? Does it correspond to the fifty / fifty rate of a credit for Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little here? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill in ten lines, citing only the thefts, allusions and clich√©s of Chakushin ari (One Missed Call). The others here will hit most of them, though perhaps they are not Safi (Hypnosis) by Ochiai for the squalid TV broadcast that taunts supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi picks up her zombie-like mother, One One Called made me jump a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (it seems Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in the audacious retrospective of Audition, and as Boss Aoki of Dead or Alive of the drowning tub of dung and other, could be the most convincing and wicked character I've ever seen. So here's a cop.
