The creativity of this film was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left a good story, only to replace horrible special affections. This movie seemed to focus on funny kids, but couldn't even do it. Many small low-budget films have the potential to become great movies, but this film is not close to that. Fortunately this will be another easily realized and easily forgotten film. This film was probably a chance for the actors to earn some money on the side until their chances came for a real role in a good movie. Anyone with a modicum of respect for the movies should avoid seeing this movie at all costs.
