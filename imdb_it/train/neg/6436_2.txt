I'm a kind person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without doubt the worst movie I've seen in a long time. There was a very small plot and the most interesting areas that had been touched, namely what Jesus really wanted us to know, were overlooked and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishments inflicted on our heroine (Arquette). The total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more human for his character and for the public. The acting had just arrived and the direction was not inspired. And if I saw another drop of water or a dove flying towards the camera, I could have started screaming louder than Patricia.
