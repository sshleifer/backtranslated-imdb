This God-forgotten movie is about three stupid millionaires who gather a group of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, acting is terrible and the film makes absolutely no sense. It's not scary in any way, it's so stupid to make me laugh, and that's why he deserved 1 star. The film is not at all violent, but it is rather dreary and focuses mainly on women's breasts all the time and some characters are very annoying and complaining. Also, the monsters in this movie are so vulgar and fake and they don't scare you into throwing something on the screen. Last, but not least, the ending is terrible. I don't want to give it away, just in case you're weird enough to see this piece of junk. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not Evaluated (but should be R) for Nudity, Profanity and Gild Mite.
