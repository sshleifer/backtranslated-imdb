"Look, I know this could suck right now, but the pain is temporary, the film is forever. Whatever you do now is burned in celluloid forever and for thousands of years to come." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> Initially it was a film for Steven Spielberg, the director who hired several screenwriters to adapt the script so that it was better suited to his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a prisoner recently released by Robert De Niro. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds", the dysfunctional family unites to defeat the beast, the beast is the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during the trial. <br /> <br /> In the typical Spielberg style, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is promptly acquitted of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and practically all the "fathers" in the land of Spielberg, the father claims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet tail that Spielberg likes. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually abandoned the photo and the project was instead handed over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was trying to try his hand at a more commercial price. The result is probably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, its most illuminating. <br /> <br /> The failures or failures of an artist are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the images are not burned, we find ourselves with a kind of inner core. This ?? the remaining carcass - is what the director's cinema talks about. <br /> <br /> Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal film, so we will not find any thematic link to the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("You have already sacrificed me!" shouts De Niro, but the film themes of Catholic redemption are the cookie cutter). What the film does, however, exposes the kind of language that its filmography does. Watch as Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, as if he were frantically zooming in on handles and windows in an attempt to force the tension and how his characters are all noisy and screaming with attention. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place in a context that is no longer wide and the family home does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense for something in the picture, Scorsese fails to film the space or create any kind of spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason is that Scorsese's camera must always be tied, or intimately linked, to his central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera must be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance on the street and on a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future urban landscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and the Most other directors can create a sense of space with "close up-mid-shot-wide shot" combinations, but Scorsese can't do it. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all for the character. You break that cable, leave that ring, that taxi, look away from De Niro and everything collapses. He simply cannot break away from this very documentary style of shooting, which, in a sense, is a prerequisite for cinematographic action. <br /> <br /> Scorsese tried to correct this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and set design become the central character, but even this spatially conscious experiment is sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, l actor who inexorably draws Scorsese's camera towards him like a moth against a light bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, this is a bad and vulgar movie. Look at the opaque paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the foolish special effects in rotation and the clash of fists. However, we have Robert De Niro to resume the game. De Niro, who gives his body to Scorsese as a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an impromptu romantic sequence with a young Juliette Lewis, she sticks her thumb in her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl escapes, both aroused and rejected by the interest of this man. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so delightfully over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese. You would need the operatic tone and baroque images of someone like De Palma to make it work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> It's worth a look.
