Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable. 30 minutes when I was having trouble staying awake. 60 minutes in and I hit the record button and fell asleep. Finished watching it the next morning. He shouldn't be bothered. What a waste of an exceptional cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a "Day in the life ..." Treat your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie. I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep. Horrible dialogue. Non-existent continuity. Work with the camera could have been done with a Super 8 hand and a better look. <br /> <br /> This film was a total disaster.
