Jeff Lowell wrote and directed "Over Her Dead Body" badly. The idea is first of all, it's stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake. <br /> <br /> Less Eva Longoria Parker there is almost nothing attractive in this film. Eva looks as big as ever and offers a pleasant performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks tired and less interested. Lake Bell is a complete mixture. It has a masculine appearance and offers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, as is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected more entertainment from this movie. Unfortunately, I have not entertained myself.
