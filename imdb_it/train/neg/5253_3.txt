The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for "Woman". I don't know if it was intentional or not, but if it was certainly a little chuckling from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But those were the only giggles that the film got. Not that it aimed at giggles, it's a horrible film for heaven's sake! A horrible film in more than one meaning. It is a pity that such a premise was wasted with horrible and unbearable moments for the viewer (certainly not for the faint of heart !!)! And it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown. I'm not even assuming a moral obligation (because the films don't really have that kind of task or function) to discuss what is shown here, but this is a new low of the entire "torture movement" that has grown into last years!
