I had never heard of it, then I discovered that it was the man with the deadly lens, of which I had heard but had not seen. Connery's presence prompted me to buy it, and it's not good. It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it's not that funny, unless you find the name of General Wombat (?) Funny. It looks like a flat thriller from the 70s until the last ten minutes, when it comes to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the White House between the president and his assistants that don't work. It is almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was modified to arrive at the entire history of nuclear bomb redemption and suicide bombings, which I believe should be played for laughter, but again, not I'm so funny. Location shooting is excellent, but the studio stuff looks like a cheap TV. I couldn't believe that the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Just laugh: Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane. He never says that Never ever seems like a genius again.
