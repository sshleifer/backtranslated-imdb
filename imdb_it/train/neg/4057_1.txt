This is an extremely boring film. If you grew up during Vietnam Was, like I did, then you saw and heard all the filming and the topics of the film here a hundred times now. But what really makes this film boring is the narration of director Carlton Sherwood. Most of the film is shot with Sherwood who speaks directly to the camera of his opinion on this conflicting period in the history of our nation. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to remember Vietnam, then you win "find something new here There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. The younger spectators who are interested in the subject should see the excellent George Butler film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly destined to be an ax work on John Kerry, but fails miserably in achieving that goal.
