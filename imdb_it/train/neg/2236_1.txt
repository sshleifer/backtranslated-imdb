I really don't know where to start. The acting in this film was really terrible, I don't remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie that they couldn't play. Not only was the acting bad, the characters were also incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> Then there's the action. I believe that even children know that when someone is hit, there is blood involved. But when someone is shot at Snitch for ten (!!) times, there's absolutely no blood. Well, I guess it's just me. <br /> <br /> To make it short (because believe me, I can go on for hours on this film), this is without doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. This film should be number 1 at the bottom 100 without a doubt.
