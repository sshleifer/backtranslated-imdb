There are a number of problems with this film, but the bottom line is that he tried to do too much with too little. The basic story is pretty good, but the money wasn't there to do the story justice. The non-existent budget has really killed this film. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) wrote credit on "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids", which was a big box office hit. However, that film had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when not making a movie. If he had waited a few more years, technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention the fact that he could have found a company with money).
