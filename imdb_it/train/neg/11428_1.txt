OH MY GOD .. THE WORST SH * I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU - this is the main thought that came to my mind immediately after watching the movie. And I really don't understand anyone with the opposite myth. However, maybe the idea was good but the effect was miserable. In particular, I mean the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion it has destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character was interpreted in a sliced ​​and annoying way. Every time it appears, remember that you are watching a movie and destroying the spirit of the moment, then the whole movie because most of the time you can see are its stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create emotion. TERRIBLE, don't waste time.
