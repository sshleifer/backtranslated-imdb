Screenwriter and director Tony Piccirillo has adapted his drama to a recently widowed hetero man who has learned to be HIV-positive in the last three weeks; he tracks down the only homosexual comrade he has ever had, takes him to an apartment and ties him up, forcing a blood test on the boy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positive. The intriguing idea sounds better on paper than it does. James Marsden's prisoner is realistically cynical and arrogant, but the actor's artificial mannerisms are staggering - it's like looking at a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality - going from a shy boy to a kidnapped-on-board isn't convincing, nor are the conversations the two men have. Marsden's celebrated gay is not apathetic, of course - he is momentarily in tune with the difficult situation of Speedman - but he does not react or behave like any homosexual man in this circumstance. The film is not a real scam, but it is a fraud, hampered by bad editing, poorly designed flashbacks, low-budget production and the grand finale that smacks of fake fiction and soapy melodrama. * 1/2 from ****
