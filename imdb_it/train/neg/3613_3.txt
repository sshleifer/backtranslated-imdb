It's a poor film, but I have to give it to the main character in this .... Francine Forbes. He seemed to behave less and I personally thought she was pretty. Too bad it only appears in another movie in the database. In addition, the film is full of fights and fake death scenes. People get stabbed and Gush like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like watching poor horror movies, I highly recommend this.
