OK, after seeing this invigorating film and losing an hour and many minutes of my life, here is the basic summary: Genie comes out of the ghetto boom box, gives this guy with shaggy hair 3 desires, the child wastes his desires, Shaq sucks rapping, and I think so. <br /> <br /> So mostly I laughed, I cried ...... but mostly I laughed at the cutting comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player / rapper and boy with shaggy hair. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film for college kids who sit around drinking a few beers with their close friends and seriously need a good laugh. <br /> <br /> I am going to give him a 3 out of 10 only b / c the film is based on 3 magical wishes. <br /> <br /> If I had 3 wishes one would be to cancel this horrible film and for everyone to pretend that Hollywood didn't waste money to do it.
