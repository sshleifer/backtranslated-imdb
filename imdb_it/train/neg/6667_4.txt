it was kind of an enjoyment of this movie until Ed Norton's facial hair problems. Without revealing details of the plot - in one afternoon he had a slight beard, but the same evening the beard was gone and a very lush mustache was in place. He was much fuller than the bearded mustache. Later, during a dark night out in the open, the mustache was gone and he appeared a clean harbor. It was on an occasion that it would not have been an option to stop shaving. These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the film and ruined any credibility he had previously had. Also, I found that the long cowboy scene alone in his bedroom was too reminiscent of De Niro in Taxi Driver. Although it was thought to be a tribute, it was thrown too often for this viewer.
