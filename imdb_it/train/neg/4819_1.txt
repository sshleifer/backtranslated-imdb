This is a typical low budget 1970s casino. It should be a docudrama about a Bigfoot-chasing crew across the northwest Pacific. Each character is a stereotype, from the native American to the cynical cowboy. Acting and narration are a complete joke. If you hope to see a lot of bigfoot footage, keep hoping. There won't be much, and what could you do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a video camera; it would look better than this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that I don't like the low cost of 1970; I want it. Is that this is such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, disgusting history and no emotions that you just can't have fun. It does not fit the "so bad is good" category, nor can you get a laugh at how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. These are mainly boring movies of people camping, walking, riding and watching wild life. There is a bigfoot attack that is completely stupid; presumably our friend Sasquatch is throwing stones at campers from above while the rifles are fired at him. At that point you're cheering heavily for the bigfoot to drop some rocks on the director's heads and stop everything.
