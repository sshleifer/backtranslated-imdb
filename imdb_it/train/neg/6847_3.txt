This was a film I always wanted to see when it came out. The promotions were catchy and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the film is not so good <br /> <br /> It has many flaws <br /> <br /> The beginning it's good and until the murder has been successful, but the film becomes flat when the romantic track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow <br /> <br /> So the turning point on Govinda and Tabu who are in love leaves more doubts and defects and then how come Govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor peasant? <br /> <br /> Even the last flashback is prolonged and also the whole clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra disappoints The music is ok, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br /> Govinda plays a negative role and does it very well even if he overcomes it too much sometimes Karisma is good but sometimes he irritates me with his cries Tabu is fine Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screams and rest acting oka y
