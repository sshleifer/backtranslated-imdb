I only rented this movie because I liked the cover. However, as soon as the film started, I had regrets. It looks like they used a home video camera to shoot this movie and let a child do it. They also used inappropriate faces and ghostly forms to try to scare people, but I found myself laughing, I could have put it together myself and done a better job. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, I felt that he had some really good ideas but due to unclear lines and in some cases acting was blurred. He had no direction. <br /> <br /> I didn't want to sit around because it caused me physical pain watching him but I always finish what I start so I took a deep breath and let him continue. Definitely 98 minutes of my wasted life. <br /> <br /> I would like to spare you the embarrassment of knowing that you have seen "Haunted Boat" and find something that is more fun. I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but this was a huge disappointment, I thought nothing could get worse after "Terror Toons", but that made me reconsider. A disappointment for its kind. <br /> <br /> * out of ***** (The star is for ideas of having their worst fears coming for them)
