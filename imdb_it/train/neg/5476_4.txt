I don't know if this is one of the original SyFy Channel movies, but it's exactly how it feels. An inexpensive, low-budget action movie that was probably made very quickly, it contains laughable effects, lame dialogues and a faintly faded star to give some recognition to the brand (funny how many of the 90210s are making cheap TV movies now). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, whom we know from history as the explorer who wiped out entire populations of natives while conquering parts of North America. Here, he is not interpreted as a hero or sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; his character would probably be killed if it were not based on a historical figure. In this story, Cortes is engaged in a brief survey mission, trying to find something of value to prove he deserves funding to further explore America. He and his men find a small tribe of Aztecs afflicted with dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The hero of the story turns out to be Lieutenant Rios, who proves to be honored, resourceful and wise. He knows the right thing to do in every situation, which puts him in opposition to Cortes, as well as with the young, ambitious Aztec shaman. Naturally, the native girl who should marry the stubborn and intriguing shaman falls in love with Rios, favoring her anger towards Spanish strangers. So it's all a nice clich√©. Dinosaurs are shipped relatively easily. Although it takes place in an area that seems completely open, the story takes place practically in the woods or in the Aztec village 95% of the time, so it's not even visually exciting. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Ian Ziering. They gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent, and somehow he disappeared inside. However, for a second you don't look or sound Spanish, making the choice of casting wrong in every way. If this film had been released in the theater, it would have been chosen for a Razzie, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Overall, forgettable.
