The progression of the plot is enough to "fit one in" and create curiosity about the result. However, in the end, the feeling that remains is that the film's producers have forgotten to end it. If the intention was to create a perpetual circle (occasionally done in the Twilight Zone), it was too sloppy to be considered a positive effort.
