After seeing a heavily censored version of this film on television years ago, I was curious to see the unpublished version. I was surprised that he was more credible and well acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers also mentioned this, that is, what exactly is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Have you already raped other victims? Is it completely psychotic or "average" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on his younger sister? Is this character believable, or is it just a matter of more background being necessary? It almost seems simultaneously an unpleasantly credible character, and too crazy to actually be able to maintain a teaching job that puts him in contact with young and vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of spectators in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terrifyingly convincing. The film occupies a difficult position between pure exploitation and serious treatment halfway through the subject, without entering completely into either of the two modes. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's not even that good.
