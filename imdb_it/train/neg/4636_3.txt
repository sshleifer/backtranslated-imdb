The "Confidential" part was meant to tour the popular appeal of the filthy magazine of the same name, while the theme of the labor racket was linked to the Congress of the day's title investigations. However, despite the cast of an A-level B movie and some good screenplay ideas, the film limps for about 73 minutes. It's a production of low-cost jacks all the way. What is needed to compensate for the poor production values ​​is a little imagination, especially from the insignificant director Sidney Salkow. For example, some shots of daylight would have helped alleviate the succession of squalid studio sets. An elegant helmsman like Anthony Mann could have done something with the thick material, but Salkow treats it as another payday exercise. Too bad that the typical low-key style of Brian Keith does not work here, being simply wood and lethargic, at the same time the cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. overcomes the top like a drunken-eyed savage. Clearly, Salkow is not the director of an actor. But you have to hand it over to that small and cheeky number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. Too bad, he wasn't in charge. My advice ... skip it, unless you find yourself in ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing but slam whiskeys in typical 50s fashion.
