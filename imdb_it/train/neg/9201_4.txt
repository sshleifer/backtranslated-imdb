This is the film that embodies the fear of D & D of the 80s (and even today). The fear is that people who play D & D (or any other role-playing game) are "sucked in" and lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and continue to kill fools, sacrifices of children, suicides, etc.) . A fantastic film for anyone who likes to blame society's problems on inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a role-playing game, a video game or even played in a comedy will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It is for D & D what Wargames was for computers. Also, like a movie, it's just a bit crappy.
