The only reason I saw the film until the end was the "hope" of seeing something interesting. The film is really bad and the girl's performance is really, really bad, honestly, I'm not a film critic or an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work is incredibly bad. <br /> <The first thing that came to my mind as soon as he started talking was: "She has a relationship with Willem Dafoe and has agreed to help her with the script and appear in her film since she was the brilliant director". .. surprise, surprise, the day after seeing the film I discovered on the internet that Giada Colagrande is his wife. Horrible story and terrible performance.
