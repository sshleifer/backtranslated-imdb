Let me tell you that at the beginning I didn't watch this movie with high expectations. It was recommended to me by a friend with a mediocre taste in the movies, and "MTV" was pasted on the cover, so I didn't expect much. What I expected was a tear-jerk, too dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to start that I had never read the book or looked at other versions of the film. <br /> <br /> Acting was my main complaint about the film. For god it is FANTASTIC. The main girl is pretty average, but compared to the rest of the cast is Maryl Streep. The main hero, Heath, is simply horrible. He can sing strong songs that sound good, but that's all. His acting broke the "sad" moments being so ugly in points that I just burst out laughing. Even the girl Isabel was very pretty and her brother was just a flat character played by an actor who couldn't show any emotions. And when he tried, he failed miserably. Neil Patrick Harris was the only decent actor, playing Edward, although it is obvious that the direction was bad because he too was not up to what I saw him do. Oh, and the father was not a bad memory for me, but it was in the movie for so little time that I hardly remember. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. More breaks than you can imagine. Predictable history (Until the end, which I barely understood). EXTREMELY one-sided characters without real depth for them ... In general it's not interesting or compelling, nothing we've never seen done MUCH better before, and nothing worth looking at here. <br /> <br /> The ending is supposed to be a tear-jerk. He didn't do anything like that. The ending is not built at all, it almost seems like an afterthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends WHY the ending really happened, and when they explained it to me I had to have a look on my face of "Wait, when they said? What?". Never a good sign. The editing was probably the worst I saw, although I understand that fading fades were made because this was originally done for TV, but in reality it's not an excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is just garbage. I'm a sensitive boy, I cried during two episodes of the Simpsons. I never cried during this shit, not even close. Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to see a tear, look elsewhere.
