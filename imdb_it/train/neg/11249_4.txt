Visually stunning? Definitely. I've seen some movies look so beautiful for a while now. Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow use amazing cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar, but something pretty cool. The time period seems to be from the 1930s or the early 1940s. The film tells of recent attacks in New York by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. Furthermore, the mysterious disappearances of important scientific minds coincide. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, it does not take a leap of faith to know that Captain Sky himself with his witty journalist girlfriend is always warm on a leash, and in his wings his faithful and competent helper. What Sky Captain has in the atmosphere and in the graphics lacks narration and characterization. The plot of this film is ridiculous. That being said, the film is going for a serial-like sensation of past movie series. They had quite distant stories and bad recitations - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and the big names in this movie. Two winners of an academic award and Jude Law could keep a film afloat, one might think, but Sky Captain sinks miserably. Despite his fantastic dark appearance, I found myself wishing the film would end and I could go on with my life. I had little interest in a story that generated little interest. I didn't care about any of the ephemeral portraits. Paltrow was just awful. Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance. The law cannot carry the tradition of a single line too directly to its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, it's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson, or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it kept so much promise and yet it was given so little. I was bored for ten minutes in the film - waiting for something to attract my interest - and it never arrived.
