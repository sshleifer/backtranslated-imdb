Guys who never think they saw this movie have already had some trouble in their heads .. This movie has NOTHING to do with Jack the Ripper (in case I thought) another B, I mean an E-Grade movie composed a group of horny teenagers at certain sex scenes that are watched just before their spleens shoot up on a nearby tree. It's not scary, fun or funny. If you really feel like an idiot without plot, then look at Cabin Fever, at least the director hasn't fallen asleep in the middle of this movie. Look only if you have absolutely nothing to do in life and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey cries on the TV.
