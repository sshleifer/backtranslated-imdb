STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) is assigned to France on a mission to reconnaissance along with three new young recruits of assault teams after disobeying a direct order from above. However, the night before their strike, they were all found macabre slaughtered by a killer with a seemingly inhuman force. With the French police around with their own investigations, he goes in search of the perpetrators, only to discover a corrupt faction of the military dealing with a new deadly drug that alters a person's DNA and gives them a terrifying new strength. > <br /> Bad cover. Bad title. Bad post-production tampering. And bad trailer. A rather ugly film. But I must say, I don't think the Attack Force is its worst. I know this will make me unpopular with most other reviewers here (maybe not Steveday!), But I think a lot of the criticism comes from all the bad news that went before the movie rather than the actual quality of it. br /> <br /> I must say that there was nowhere the dubbing or the editing of the sentences as I had been able to believe. The dubbing that was there (which made it look like Martin Sheen with a groin problem!) Was pretty awful and fairly frequent, but it wasn't used for as much of the film as I thought. The plot is fluid enough considering all the problems with the original film called Harvester that went on. Also, as another reviewer noted, the film looks good Gothic, a new twist on a Seagal film. <br /> <br /> The lowest point of the absolute killer, however, was the complete and total lack of any exciting action, with only a few scant scenes filmed for any fun. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest, though, I'd rather see it again than Flight of Fury, Today You Die or Out for a Kill. **
