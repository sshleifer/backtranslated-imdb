<br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven finally bombed about this. It has become a joke on itself. Once again we have a film that includes sex and violence, immorality, women's discontent and a lot of discussion between the characters and the pots. <br /> <br /> It's all for nothing. Because theirs is not at all an action in this film. It merges all his set pieces. All the actors give the kind of performance of a Verhoeven film. In other words unrestrained on acting on almost all levels. Starship Troopers got away with it because it was such a macho world that the characters lived. In this, scientists behave the same way. Sorry Paul, but Soldiers and scientists are not really facts of the same mentality. <br /> <br /> A major flaw in the plot was that after escaping that night to do evil things, the character of Kevin Bacons returns to the science lab where we have already spent more time watching these animated characters (excluding Elizabeth Shue) to walk and talk. Why not show the extent of what the character could do in the outside world. How could they track him down if he could be anywhere ?? Think of all the different things that could have been done with this concept, both in terms of history and characterization. Then look at what this movie does and you're really badly done and you thought the whole project was really. <br /> <br /> The Doco is more offensive on the DVD where everyone claims that Verhoeven is a sort of MAd Genius. Well, one in two is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing interesting. Just like the title says. <br /> <br /> Hollow !!!
