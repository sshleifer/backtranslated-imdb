As a longtime Superman fan from the comics, through the 1950s series, the first two of Chris Reeves and Lois & Clark's films, and finally Smallville, I was * really * hoping for something clever with "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> Instead Lex Luthor has made * another * real estate conversion attempt, another kryptonite sequence overtaken by Superman, and internal inconsistencies: could not prevent himself from falling into the ocean when he is stuck with 6 " of kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3 "of it, * leaving the rest embedded in him *, can he lift * a continent * in space ?? Actually, the only hero in the story was Lois's partner: I can't remember his name. He made all kinds of life-saving heroic things with nothing but courage and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability ... just a normal human. <br /> <br /> They keep making Superman so small. Because we can't have Superman fighting against Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's petty schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they're doing it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yes ... I think I'll stay true to Smallville ... <br /> <br /> You should probably, as well ...
