This film is about a policeman (Ching Wan Lau) trying to capture a super-intelligent thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company led by a Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever the plan the cop looks for the thief he somehow knows them in advance. This film, played by beautiful main actors, a beautiful leading actress and good shots of Hong Kong scenes, actually has no substance. It's all flash, and even the flash soon becomes boring. I lost all interest to a third of the film, and there is no longer any ransom, except for cinematography, which looks good. Just consider seeing this movie if you can do it for free. Also, consider stopping to watch the movie for 20 minutes in the film because it's all the same at the end: BORING. 6/10
