Think of the Grudge 2 finale with the following: <br /> <br /> - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar who cuts himself - and a gruesome mirror <br /> <br /> OH AND UNDERWATER SEA ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> it's not a good movie ... seriously I didn't like it at all. The poster for the film is also extremely misleading and I found out that it was just to make people look at it ... I can't believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save time and money ... go see Saw III ... a film where writing makes you feel like there's an effort put into it ... <br /> <br / > Mike and I out
