Michael, a five-year-old boy, sees his mother being killed by an ax by the serial killer father "The Highwayman", who later commits suicide. "20 years later" grew up Mike (Gordon Currie, of PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends at home, the grandparents, to "dominate their fears" at a costume party of Halloween night. Morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman, becomes possessed by the spirit of his dead father and kills them using their phobias. The characters are thrown out of a window, drowned in a bathroom, eaten by mice, blown up, etc. The mortal turns into a father and a tree, walks around and makes stupid jokes. After finding a girl cut and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters stay at home, behave cheerfully, make jokes and have sex. <br /> <br /> Morty's design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees of the original Friday THE 13TH) is surprisingly delicious as her grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares, bad acting, brain characters, repetitions of flashback movies and annoying distorted images. Moreover the only two minority characters (the Indian girl and a half black) are the first to die. BLAH!
