This had to be an embarrassment for every member of the entirely African-American cast. Every derogatory and derogatory stereotype of the American black community is in the foreground. I will not reinforce the insults by listing them here, except for mentioning hens, watermelons and nuts. <br /> <br /> A good Ethel Waters song (and a couple of bad guys), and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of Sammy Davis, aged 8, bring the total to something less than 1 on the IMDb scale.
