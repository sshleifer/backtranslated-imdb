The basic plot in this film is not bad. A lady makes it big and returns from her alma mater to be worshiped. But, despite the good acting of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. The fault is for me or Joan Crawford or for the director or both, since his performance is simply horrible. Instead of being a real person, it makes a wonderful representation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, he stares into space and has a "dazed" expression. After a few minutes it became really annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I don't like for his performance, as he has done more than his overacting - in films like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of his later films, like BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - surely there have been better ones.
