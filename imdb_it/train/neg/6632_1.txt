What the hell has become of our dear Ramu? Is it the same man who created Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he clearly jumped off the high cliff he climbed giving the industry some of the greatest works of all time. This film is made to fall like a brick. I had to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit down because I would not be able to take my car out of the parking lot before others left too. Otherwise, nothing would have made me sit over the interval. <br /> <br /> This film is nowhere near Sholay. It doesn't even come close to it within a mile. I think Ramu definitely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic job. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days ago, in which the interviewer said that Ramu does not sleep more than 4 hours a day, which is not much. I completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep probably caused his tribute to the film. <br /> <br /> There is no power in the exhibition. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even seem scary. It looked more terrifying in the few posters and backgrounds I've seen before. Ramu's favorite, Nisha Kothari, did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogues (in fact none if I remember correctly). He opened his mouth in this film and found a place in history. The new guy who plays the role of Jai seems to have that cheeky look, but he hasn't managed the role of Jai at all. I can't go on ... I'm sorry ... my pain is too big for me to handle now. <br /> <br /> I have promised myself throughout the film that I will look at the original Sholay again just to see that it is still there. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: horrible film. The media and critics will cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers again, I'm one of Ramu's biggest fans, and I can't spare him for this.
