I think the favorite part of this film, the one that exemplifies the pure and simple uselessness, the stupidity and the inanity of the procedure, reaches the peak of the film. DOCTOR NELSON and his unmarried friend the sheriff finally cornered the Melting Man on a landing on stairs at a power plant. Keep in mind that Nelson searched for the MM for almost the entire movie, and that the MM killed and ate several people at this point (including his boss), and Nelson is very aware that MM is violently mad and hungry for human flesh and blood. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff has the gun pointed at MM, that is, and I give the film and Rick Baker's props for this, the most disgusting and terrifying object in human form we have ever seen. And he shouts a very important question to DOCTOR TEDSON: "WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!?!?" <br /> <br /> The camera switches to DOCTOR TED NELSON, and it is obvious that Ted has no idea what to do next. Apparently Ted was so interested in the problem of FINDING the Melting Man, he never thought of bringing with him some containment devices, a lasso or a straitjacket, or a net, or some tranquilizer dart, or maybe a tape New Age of Vangelis to soothe the ferocious beast. <br /> <br /> So the sheriff panics and shoots, the Melting Man goes mad, and the result is hilarity. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this explains why NASA has been touring the Space Shuttle program in the sub-lunar space for the last 30 years instead of returning to the Moon or Mars as everyone knows they should be doing. I do not know. <br /> <br /> However, this is the kind of disgusting, lazy writing and direction that underestimates every aspect of this film. It's hard to say how good the actors actually are, because the movie has the complete disregard for their characters. <br /> <br /> Other incredibly painful sequences also increase the stupidity of the procedure: there is a scene with the most lumpy old couple in the world trying to steal the lemons from a grove, only to be torn to pieces by the man who is melting. This scene is a nadir in the cinema of the 70s. I can guarantee that you have never seen a more useless and irritating environment with stranger-looking people in your whole life. And the assault of the Melting Man on the lady who lives in the house where they hold a peeing horse on the walls defies any attempt to try it. (By the way, the famous director Jonathon Demme has a starring role in this scene as a redneck husband who goes first to control the house and never comes out again). The only thing that prevents the actress from literally chewing the scenery is that, as I said, their horse has apparently pissed on it. And we are forced to watch his hysterics for at least two minutes longer than any other SANE director can hold. <br /> <br /> Burr DeBenning should beat the poop of the IMM director and photographer. I remember from an old episode of Columbo in which he looked VERY better than he did here - the idea of ​​anyone of a leading man, but solid and unobtrusive. But no one could be as unattractive in real life as his director makes him look here. <br /> <br /> All the others come out a little better, except for the old couple (and they are silent, I know they were played for laughter, but I'm not laughing!) but not much. <br /> <br /> This certainly falls into the category of film disasters "So bad that you can't see". However, I would watch it again before watching a lot of other 70 and 80 abortions ("Track of The Moonbeast" and "It Lives By Night" come to mind), and MST coverage is a lot of fun, so if you have the possibility, look at the MST version.
