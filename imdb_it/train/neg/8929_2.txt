This hodge-podge adapted from a novel by Gore Vidal (actually one of the great American writers) makes THE MAGIC CHRISTIAN and VALLEY OF THE DOLLS like works of art by Fellini. Raquel Welch, with an incredible body (and in reality not very tall) in a leading role (except KANSAS CITY BOMBER when she was good enough) to play the alter-ego of Rex Reed (film critic, not critical), just to be surrounded by drag queens (big chick) Mae West, horny John Huston, a young and "naive" Farrah Fawcett (pre-Lee Majors, what a shame), and various other creep-azoids who pretend to cheat even WAY, things don't have nothing for this except the old film clips interspersed (for example Widmark in KISS OF DEATH, Lena Horne) ... ONLY, so everyone can continue to bleed. <br /> <br /> A 2 out of 10. Better performance = ?. It's so ugly, it's worth seeing!
