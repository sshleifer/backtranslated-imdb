This program didn't do it for me, even though I'm a fan of the genre. The main factor that disappointed me was the fact that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the main character. This made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was finished. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to leave my criticism there because I'm not a film critic, however, the guidelines on IMDb state that you have to insert 10 lines of comments. It reminded me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene, and I hope the authors of this program can use more variety to engage viewers. I don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after seeing things like "the thread", I expected great things from the police drama.
