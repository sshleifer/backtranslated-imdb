Denzel is the only right thing in this film. <br /> <br /> Perhaps at an early stage this was a better film. Someone decided to cut some points of action and plot at the beginning of the film, giving away most of the plot in the first 5 minutes. That and ruin everything that accumulates in the rhythm and rhythm that the film could have had before. <br /> <br /> So first it confuses you and then puts you out of action. The dramatization pushes beyond the suspension of unbelief. Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that films like this can potentially instill in viewers. Of course, it does so if you're looking for that ... get thrown out.
