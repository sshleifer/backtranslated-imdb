Has anyone stopped to understand what kind of films they were producing here? Now a former naval officer assigns himself to a group of boys at a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy, right? Mistaken . This is just a rough comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments. At this point he could have been looked extremely stupid, but I found Damon Wayans' voice irritating beyond imagination. Do you talk like that in real life? If he does, he has my understanding, but he won't get any of my money from watching his movies
