A group of women who don't know how to act sit around, talk, smoke grass. They have another woman in a wheelchair who is hiding because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill someone to feed this person human flesh that really looks like a store-bought ham that they have been clutching some plastic fingers. We don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there's a body on the floor, covered with a bloody sheet. I can no longer eat Spam cover from a sheet because of this. The mere thought that Spam covers from a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic measure caused by trying to overcome this whole film. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a boy who is "hunting" by torturing a guy who has tied to a chair is his basement. Why he captured this boy and how he is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch sisters is never explained. There are also scenes of a "superhuman" type that is going crazy. He beats blood and punches through a wall, but whoever is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor tied to the plot. <br /> <br /> There is no action, no special effects, no history. If you want to watch some boring people talk deeply about anything while sitting around eating ham and smoke, then here is 90 minutes of that, because, except for one scene where a chick hooks up on a street corner and the aforementioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING happens. (YAWN) Oh, I almost forgot, you can see them moving some things, including the deformed sister, when they move into their new apartment. It is one of the few times that they are not sitting on a couch or lying on the bed.
