The book on which this film is based has seriously changed my life. But to say that this film was a disappointment is an understatement. The acting, the direction, the cinematography and the plot were horrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I told countless people in the book, but now I will tell them that they should definitely not watch the movie! I didn't expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they left out too many key components of the book. The film has tried, but failed, to provide a powerful and inspiring message and has only diminished the central theme of the prophecy. As I stood in the position of those who had not read the book, I saw the Prophecy of Celestino as a pile of false B.S. I am completely disappointed with Redfield for the way this film came out.
