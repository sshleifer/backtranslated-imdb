According to the IMDb, Takashi Miike's Master of Horror segment, Imprint, has been banned in the United States. So I thought about translating the Swedish review I had just written for this ... <br /> <br /> It was hard not to have any kind of expectation from Ichi The Killer-director of the Takashi Miike episode in the Masters of Horror series . And the cover of Imprint's DVD was very promising. <br /> <br /> The story takes place mainly in a remote Japanese brothel, at some point during the nineteenth century, and tells the story of a journalist looking for Komomo, the woman he left behind and with whom he has promised to come back. Tired and downcast he arrives at the brothel, hoping that this will be the end of his long journey. It turns out that one of the prostitutes, a deformed and quiet girl, knows about Komomo, and the desperate man makes her say where he is and what has happened to her since he left. The story she tells him is as regrettable as it is hard to swallow ... <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about the episode was how unnatural it seemed that the Japanese cast spoke mostly fluent American-English. But I'll leave it at that, it's not a big deal. What is a big problem, however, is how miserable the rest was. Miike's story moves at such a slow pace that I couldn't help but look at my watch several times during the 63 minutes. The extended toric scene, which takes place somewhere in the middle of the film, felt so demotivated - and pornographically intrusive - that not even that scene became interesting. I felt violent only because of the violence itself, without a sense of style or purpose. The only scenes that caused any kind of emotion from me were the images of bleeding fetuses that rolled along the bottom of the rapidly flowing water ... and, in all honesty, the only emotions they provoked were feelings of disgust. <br /> <br /> The journalist looking for the love he left is played by Billy Drago, more memorable to me than Frank Nitti - Al Capones white assassin dressed in Brian De Palmas The Untouchables (1987). I have always found the portrait of Dragos by Nitti very cold (and I mean it in a good way), and this is probably why he almost bothered me when I found it so terrible (NOT in a positive sense) in this one. His acting seems to flow between no feeling or empathy of any kind to show some bad feeling. When his character has to react to the terrible things that Komomo has been subjected to, I was sitting on the couch, writhing and turning in an attempt to escape Drago's horrible acting job. I am grateful that most of the story is told by Yuoki Kudoh (Memoirs of a geisha, 2005), who plays the deformed prostitute. <br /> <br /> Probably the ending should be stifling, perhaps even revolting and horrendous, but I just found it to be kind of ... you know ... "blah" (and I looked at the clock again, for the umpteenth time, wishing only that the shit episode ended). Maybe the ending made me smile a little, but it's only because I couldn't help but think of an episode of Red Dwarf, and the upset minds of Craig Charles and Danny John-Jules, with their eyes glued on them to make it look like aliens ... Fortunately you, if you've seen that episode and now you decide to see Imprint, forever ruined the final graphic. <br /> <br /> My first thought, when the imprint is finally over, is that the only thing that made the pain of seeing it was worth it, he was listening to the main theme of Edward Shearmur's title (the same music that I believe is used in every episode of this series), and that - if ever - is a great warning, don't you think? <br /> <br /> You could indicate the design of the costume, by Michiko Kitamura, and say that there, at least, there is something that is NOT lacking in style and refinement .. but there are so many other films and TV programs that it is much better to show the Japanese "geisha-fashion". This is nothing but inferior and I am disappointed. Takashi Miike's Masters of Horror episode is boring, uninteresting and useless. In other words; It's really, really BAD!
