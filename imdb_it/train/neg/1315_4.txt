Oliver Hardy wakes up with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see his new wife and Ollie's baby. The problem is that they don't exist - Ollie apparently invented them! So, it's up to him and his friend to find a woman with a child who will agree to pose as his family. <br /> <br /> This is not a particularly unique story idea, as I have seen at least a couple of other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon. DO NOT LET US. It's a lot better than ONE TOO MUCH - probably a lot of this is due to the fact that it was made a decade later - when the comedy became a little more sophisticated and was based less on a meaningless slapstick. Now I'm not against physical comedy, but in some slapstick movies, people start shooting guns wildly, kicking and strangling each other, etc. With little provocation. Unfortunately, at the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of this makes sense and it was like they were running out of ideas for history. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not exactly a milestone in entertainment. There is not enough payoff to deserve to watch it unless you are a silent obsessive fan like me.
