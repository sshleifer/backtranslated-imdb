Most likely Like Francis Veber, one of the best directors of comedies in the world (at least when he followed his native France), he managed to make such an unstoppable film that is beyond the reason of the simple mortal man to discern. It's not just that the characters are so unlikely or that the film is so completely devoid of even the lowest spirit form: it's really painfully physically to look at, such an endless parade of inept written, acting and film making that you can't believe this is the work of experienced and talented directors. For once, the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its theatrical lightning-and-you-miss-me exit tells the whole story. What were they thinking?
