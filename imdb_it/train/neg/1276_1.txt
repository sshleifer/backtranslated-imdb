This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. Let me tell you again: THIS IS THE WORST SINGLE VIDEO I HAVE NEVER SEEN. <br /> <br /> He had all the marks of a bad movie: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music. I thought there were a couple of points for horror movies. The first is that it should have enough suspense to scare you. This film gets and F in this category. The second point is that when a character dies or something bad happens to them, we should worry about it. This film also gets an F in this sense. <br /> <br /> The first story, a woman is taken by wolves after having feared that this happened to her. The next story, an OCD boy dies from not being careful and talks to a dead friend. Oh, and then there's the horrible story of a bad roommate. Come on, could you choose topics a little more interesting and a little less common than being alone in a house, being anonymous-retentive and having a roommate? Solves all these stories in which hallucinations, virtual reality induced by a Doctor who in turn uses it alone. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me explain something, I enjoy watching ugly horror movies and laughing at how bad they are. I couldn't do that with this. It was absolute pain to sit and watch. Never look at this movie. You will regret it.
