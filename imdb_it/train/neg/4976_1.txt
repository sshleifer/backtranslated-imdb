I watched Grendel the other night and am forced to put together a public service announcement. <br /> <br /> Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the millennial Anglo-Saxon epic. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of harmless and uninteresting films, and the previews promised an unprecedented low-budget mini-epic, but this refused to let me change channels. It was incredibly, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched the train wreck from which you could not look away, fascinated and horrible. I reached a notepad and managed to capture some of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or may just save your sanity. You have been warned. <br /> <br /> - Just to end it, Beowulf's warriors wore helmets with horns. A trivial problem compared to what came next. It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed over to any actor wandering around for the next. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant. <br /> <br /> - Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into making the film from the Ringling Brothers circus, Barnum and Bailey. He managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of the trick. <br /> <br /> - Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed like the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become the king of the Danes only a few minutes before the opening of the film and had not had the opportunity to resize the crown to fit it yet. <br /> <br /> - Facilitating the return of the actors to their work stations while waiting for tables, no one was obliged to change their hairstyles. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, hum cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialogue. To show that it was a multinational cast, everyone was encouraged to keep whatever accent they chose. <br /> <br /> - As is typical of this type of film (at least from Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case it was of strange shape, unsuitable and brand new. <br /> <br /> - The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, has followed a long tradition of hotties that should be looked at with the volume completely turned down. <br /> <br /> - The involuntary focus of the film was a compound and repetitive crossbow with exploding arrows. He never needed to be charged and even had a recoil when he was fired. He managed to destroy the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, the historical fact and the suspense of the plot alone. <br /> <br /> - Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, instead of being a long Norwegian hall, was apparently designed and built by artisans who sank with Atlantis. <br /> <br /> - Beowulf arrived at the Danes' house in a two-masted ship with stern castles that was originally part of a set, the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta. <br /> <br /> - Prince Unferth looked at Beowulf's approach using a telescope. Before you could recover from that amazing innovation, you have to see the ship from his point of view. Judging by the angle, the prince was in an airplane of some kind. <br /> <br /> - Fun Fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (like a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the breath of the actors both inside and out. <br /> <br /> - Fun fact 2: The Dark Ages that dance in Denmark look like slow dances where I went to eighth grade. <br /> <br /> - Fun fact 3: You too can make a catapult with a timed release air blast. But don't expect it to really hurt anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a World War II veteran, shouting "Coming!" to destroy any suspicion of disbelief. <br /> <br /> - Grendel was so upset and always panicked because, as a creation completely in CGI, he could not leave footprints. Even in the snow. <br /> <br /> - Grendel's mother ("Hag") was in a bad mood because she was a single mother and junior had not inherited her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make a plausible hypothesis that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing. <br /> <br /> - Grendel and her mother have chosen to kill at random, fly away or drag their prey away based only on a careful reading of the next pages of the script. <br /> <br /> - Funny medical fact: being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown half a meter against the stone causes slight scratches on the face that don't bleed much. /> <br /> - The sword of legend that Beowulf used to send the Hag was as long as he was tall and would contain enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Fortunately the swing has dispelled all worries about its weight. <br /> <br /> - The best line in the film: Prince Unferth had just been pierced by Hag and spit out a liter of blood about six feet thick. Princess Ingrid gently rocked him and said, "You'll be fine, my prince." So much for that job at the triage clinic. <br /> <br /> I feel better now.
