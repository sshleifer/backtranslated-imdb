This film is about two former football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with some bad background. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works to have sex by talking on the phone. Jennifer is threatened by a person who wants to do horrible things and asks for her help along with many other women. Mack and Lenny have more time available and often go to Miami, Florida. golf courses or going out to a sports bar where all kinds of things in the city take place. There are a lot of punches, killings and a lot of double meaning words that bring this movie completely to a big ZERO. Don't waste time, this movie only cost me 50 cents and this was too much.
