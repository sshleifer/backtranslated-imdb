WOW! Why would anyone make a sequel to an already rancid movie? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least he had an idea of ​​what he wanted to be. HPD2 has no idea what it wants to be. It exists only on the screen for reasons I cannot explain. Spoiler: The whole movie is this: Twitch (played by Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound) is transferred to another prison where there may be a box full of buried gold bricks. In the jail there is a revolt among the rival prisoners, one of them is hit by a guy named Cortez and Cortez plans his escape. During a marital visit, Twitch's girlfriend and Burke's daughter (played by Bill Goldberg) are kidnapped by Cortez and are held in an execution hall. Burke makes friends reluctantly at Twitch and they end up getting in trouble with idiotic inmates as they discover that Cortez has their loved ones. <br /> <br /> Opinion: This is the most useless sequel since Universal Soldier: The Return came out. The script is terrible, acting is horrendous, dialogue is a joke and everyone in this film is a caricature. Listen, I know it was a cheap movie, but it's not an excuse for these guys to not engage in what they do. No one in this "film" believes in the characters they play. No one in this "movie" can be taken seriously as an actor, Kurupt should be ashamed of himself: his "Twitch" character is practically a minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while being caught by Burke or other inmates . Bill Goldberg spends most of his time sulking all over the film as if he were to take a PHD (rather huge dump). The fight scenes are badly choreographed and pathetic and for an HPD2 action movie it's pretty boring even when the action is happening! Let someone tell you that this movie is somehow decent. It stinks and is the main reason why people despise Follywood.
