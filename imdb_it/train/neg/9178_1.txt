The fact of calling "House of the Dead" the worst movie of all time is that it really isn't. There are worse films out there. I look at a lot of Hong Kong ninja movies that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama with ninja shots taken at the end to create something that could technically be called "a movie". <br /> <br /> House of the Dead is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen in theaters. Coming out halfway, I actually felt a little more stupid for setting 45 minutes of this piece of junk.
