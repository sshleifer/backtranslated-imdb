it is a seismic activity with small or negligible results on the surface. Thus, in this sense, the average IMDb score is correct. <br /> <br /> A Spanish film made in the United States with third or fourth percentage actors that give a sort of "Falcon Crest" dimension to the whole story is a wonderful way to waste your time, besides wasting the money of those who supported the project financially. <br /> <br /> The snails involved are originally from Asturias, in northern Spain, but since they were not allowed in the United States, plastic ones had to be made. However, cutting them into the lettuce used to prepare the evening dinner salad contrasts rather strangely with the Parisian music and with a rather poor series of other successes forgotten by the United States (or if you have no idea who was responsible for the composition ). The actors involved were also a rather evil group, suitable only for a low-budget film that could be classified as horrible, horrible, horrible or just horrible. <br /> <br /> Consequently, the result is negligible the surface, undiscovered underground, and attractive as the 17000 chapter of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
