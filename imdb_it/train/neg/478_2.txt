The competition for the worst Warner Bros. Kay Francis movie is stiff. I've only seen eight, but Comet over Broadway is the worst so far. The best thing is that it is short. Oh, and Orry-Kelly's clothes (of course) are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis looks fat and much less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell I don't know otherwise is as good as a semi-hard "burlesque" dancer (it looked more like a fashion show than a burlesque). The final blow - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was his mother? Did I fall asleep?) Walking on a dirt path to a prison painted in foggy profiles on a sound stage, the scene is beyond beyond the ridiculous. The whole film is so cheap, so implausible and so careless as to be infected by an acute cynicism on the part of all those who did it: Warner Bros that throws rubbish at people who don't know, in the cynical respect of Warner Bros of them, what they are getting is rubbish.
