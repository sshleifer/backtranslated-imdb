The plot is rocky. Acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School performance. Cinematography is not bad but it seems to have been cut with a machete. I couldn't decide that it was an intentional movie or if the people behind it really thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Days Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running in a modern "lawless" city wearing 6 quick-release gunboats. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Imagine the good guys approaching an old farmhouse and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a balustrade. Imagine the employee in a hotel watching a obviously Western (hemisphere) movie with a Japanese soundtrack but with English subtitles. It's all very strange, but it could be improved if you look at it while taking part in a small peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to all the clich√©s of western movies that you can imagine. There is also a modern version of a ballroom girl with a good heart, AND a harp that makes the Jew vibrate in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings it to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell them your DVD player is dead.
