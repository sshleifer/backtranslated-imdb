Anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for Meera Syal, the author of the novel and of the script, to express her prejudices, her complaints and her general antipathy towards the English. The general feeling of Indian superiority over the English in this film is disgusting. <br /> <br /> The British in this film are overweight, violent, foul-mouthed, promiscuous portraits, involved in the neglect of children, stupid, ignorant, racist, ugly, eating poor and bad food - indicatively, only turning to Indian culture, the local priest can be "redeemed" at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the Indian family is beautiful, intelligent, educated, can speak many languages, caring and loving parents and forages for grammar school. The film is so insidiously prejudicial that I am amazed that the BBC has funded it. If it were the opposite, an English family in an Indian community represented in this way, the film would have been seen as racist. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when my eyebrow shot up so high on my forehead, I thought it would slip into my hairline. First, the gossip scene among women at Divali's celebration - undertext: the English are dirty and promiscuous - and men - undertext: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the meal with Anita where Neema's family tells her about cutlery - undertext: the English are so stupid, you can make them do anything. <br /> <br /> But the basic disregard for anything that is English - even English marriages are an object of contempt - is evident throughout the film. Anita's character was drawn so terrifyingly - almost the woman's trope - that I finished the film feeling angry. <br /> <br /> This is not a "bend it like Beckham" where humor is focused on love exaggerating the behavior and habits of a community by someone within that community, and it's a movie on two girls from different backgrounds coming together. Anita and Me, on the other hand, seem to confirm that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable, since the English are almost a version of the untouchable Hindu caste, and this is underlined by a subtly veiled series of attacks against the "other" community of the film: l 'English. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Anita and Me is a work full of hatred and resentment. On this basis, the BBC should not have financed its production.
