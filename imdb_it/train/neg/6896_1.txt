Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge judges below 1. What a pity. This horrible movie is so ugly that I actually turned the damn thing before the finale. The script had some bright moments, but the direction, editing, acting, audio quality and above all online delivery time was so aberrant that the judges were absolutely unbearable. <br /> <br /> The judges were advertised as modern Western-style comics, but in reality it was nothing of the sort. What is most similar is the dog poop on the bottom of the shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it continues to be smelly. <br /> <br /> Because video stores think it is right to bring this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and acting worse than school acting school. We rent films to see something better than what is on television. But Judges is worse than the most pathetic original of the SciFi Channel. I intend to claim my money back from Hollywood Video.
