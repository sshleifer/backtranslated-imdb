OK ... this movie could have been really good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good Thunderbirds movie. The boats themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, while remaining faithful to the projects we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply fantastic, like Lady P and Bill Paxton, while it wasn't exactly what I imagined Jeff Tracey was, it was pretty solid ... but then the adults were taken out of the equation and asked to believe at 8 could fly 200-ton machines. <br /> <br /> It is not so much the fact that the film was about children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my money earned in the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so hateful in the film and he seemed to be able to drive the machines as well as his brothers ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are pretty damn simple machines to use if that's the case. <br /> <br /> The film didn't seem to know if it wanted to be serious or farcical. He tried to pay tribute while he played down and generally just fell on his face. 3/10 (2 for machines, 1 for Lady P)
