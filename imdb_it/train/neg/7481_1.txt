Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her teenage Gamin career ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films to come out of years, an unequivocal disaster in which the two protagonists allow themselves a frenetic exhibition of their brand tics in an attempt to compensate for a bad script and bad direction. This thing should have been stifled at birth. I hope John Cleese has been paid a lot for having his name linked to this disaster. He is the only interpreter who has gone through this more or less unscathed smelly mess, his only fault was the inability to understand that the rest of the cast would have sunk the picture.
