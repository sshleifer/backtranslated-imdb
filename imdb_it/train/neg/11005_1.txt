This film shows a series of sketches, which go partly into each other. I realized the passing in the late movie, it just irritated me at first. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes of this film arrive without any recognizable punch and simply try to work around it, using absurdity and obscenity. The attempt to remain comic without any funny bits fails. <br /> <br /> My personal and perhaps subjective result after seeing this film (My God, it hurts my head every time I call it "film"): A brave attempt to turn anything into something big. But he failed. At least the director did something from nothing. But it's not something good. <br /> <br /> Many films have not been as fun as they were programmed, but this surpasses them all. It is the manifestation of real life in the worst scenario of film production. No. To correct myself, it's even worse than that. A film with such a bad gag, which is not funny at all. It's not even funny to see the protagonist, the writer and the director (all three of them the same guy) perish by drowning in the sea of ​​bad films. The film is too bad for this.
