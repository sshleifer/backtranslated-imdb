when we discuss a movie called "snakes on a plane", we should soon point out that snakes are damned important for the plot. <br /> <br /> what we have here are bad cgi snakes that don't look or move like real snakes. snakes are scary because they look slimy, crawl and crawl. these snakes do nothing of the kind. they slip like in a video game. they are cartoon snakes. I would go so far as to say that even someone who had a great phobia against real snakes would not have found these scary <br /> <br /> because on earth then would you like to include close-ups of these CGI failures? why not rely on suspense .. all 'less is more' ethic. or better yet, why not just make them look good in the first place? so maybe they still use them sparingly <br /> <br /> take a look at john's 'thing' carpenters. here we have real slime and blood of disturbing proportions. 20 years pass and we get this pile of smelly sfx crap 'snakes on a plane'. when do these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects are going backwards! <br /> <br /> of course you can say ... but the movie is a joke, understand? of course I agree, but do it well! in addition to the above, this film has lousy dialogues. and the music and sound effects are neither gruesome nor memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could handle every other actor that is part of this movie, except the jackson. what was he doing there? the man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? Are you offering people good value for money? no. I'd like to know what Tarantino thought when he was half of this stinker in a movie <br /> <br /> the current generation seems to have very low expectations. and Hollywood seems to offer them only what they want. leaving the cinema I saw a series of advertisements for some really horrible future releases including ... DOA: alive or dead, (another) cgi animal film called "flushed away", and another comedy from the disgusting aspect called "click". in addition to that I saw some terrible trailers, including one for (another) horror / English comedy disgust. I don't really see the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time <br /> <br /> look to see this movie on sale in the bargain DVD section for Â£ 1 in 6 months. and if you're expecting to see a black comedy with tons of great-looking snakes, and a cold, nasty ass dialogue coming from the lips of Samuel the Jack. Forget about it.
