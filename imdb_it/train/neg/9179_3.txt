It's cheese. If all you want is a video game, complete with action sequences directed to the computer for action, the film was too cheap to make special effects, it is so. My friend and I had a great time seeing him, as the theater was almost empty and we could make some noise. This movie REALLY requires disturbing. <br /> <br /> Plot? Was there a plot? OK, some stupid colleges or later types are invited to "the rave of the year" and go to one of the islands of San Juan ("If they stayed in Seattle, they would have survived." - direct quotation, or almost.) To participate. They arrive and everyone is gone, and the site is a bit destroyed (but hey, the barrel is still full!). With the help of an old crusty captain and a coast guard (who acted only a little less hard - and slightly less well than Cynthia Rothrock), they fight a lot of zombies (some that spit acid), get horrible legends, and mostly they are killed. That's all. <br /> <br /> It's not so BAD as Demonicus, but not by far, and even better than Severed (I'm kind of my alpha and personal omega for bad movies - the first one is bad but fun to criticize , and the latter is simply too damn bad to see more than once). On the other hand, if you expect an excellent video game like Resident Evil, run away !!! run away immediately !!! <br /> <br /> OK, some big questions (without too many spoilers): since the eighteenth century Spanish ships ventured into the Pacific Northwest ????? Why no one in the Pacific Northwest smugglers, and to whom - CANADA, for shouting loud ??? Because it's a rave on an anonymous (oh, excuse me, it's called "isla del muerto", shya, right) San Juan Island - and outdoors, still bearing in mind this is THE NORTHWET PACIFIC. And the rave has about 30 people present - "the rave of the year", my patoot. <br /> <br /> Fortunately there are a lot of axes around. Many of them. Everyone has them. Must be a hatchet store nearby. <br /> <br /> Finally, while the film was starting to play with a small "parody" (with elbows on I Know What You Did and Jaws), it didn't bring it close enough. <br /> <br /> OK, really at the end - when the introductory comments (in a voice-over, not least) casually mention that one of the characters "abandoned his boyfriend to focus on his fencing" it is possible to be sure that there will be some fence by the end of the film. Not a good fencing, but a couple of people stick to each other with swords, anyway.
