Well, I finally saw it. I didn't go when he came out because, frankly, I was scared. Fear of how bad it can be, or how disappointing. Not bad as Menace, and better than Clones, it wasn't particularly memorable, or satisfying. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still remember that I was sitting in the theater. From the opening strip to the end credits it was a cinematic experience that I will never forget. A timeless story of the bored boy-farmer who knows only that he was destined for more, saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil threat while being mentored by the wise wizard, the rogue pirate and the various comedians - all in a space-work setting. <br /> <br /> And it's not to punish Lucas for using an old formula. It is an old formula precisely because it works. And to his credit, he gave new twists that made him very special. <br /> <br /> Then Empire arrived and the story became more than just a fairy tale. The darkness entered the image and we learned one of the great twists of all time. The great villain, Vader was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw him coming. Of course, I'm convinced that not even Lucas came to the script. Go back and watch Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, see if it really gets confused. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is a fun movie - tremendous effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But a film lives or dies on the plot, the story it tells. Oh, certainly, a really good acting can save a weak storyline, but a weak storyline combined with bad acting - it's a burden that no director can overcome, certainly not as bad a one as I am forced to make George Lucas is (Man he has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers by some very good actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * The plot. Oh my. You understand, it's already hampered by what happened in the first two films, so it's an incredible weight. One too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First we have the sheer absurdities of the background. We have Anakin who is found as a child on Tatooine, the product of a virginal and miraculous birth - the "chosen one". Well, this detail is never explained remotely. In fact, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that they might be wrong. Oh well, okay then. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now, this same prodigy turns out to be the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And will he return to Tatooine and never know that he was there? Wow! What about that. Examine the old voluntary suspension of disbelief, eh George? However, we have this bratty, moody, petulant, whining young boy, who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in the history of cinema - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good boy who falls by grace, just for finally reach redemption at the end. <br /> <br /> How, pray, does this happen? Because, he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth. Now, of course, he lives in a stellar civilization that treats gravity as we treat gasoline, but presents itself in the "darkness to be" perhaps to check with a doctor because perhaps, just maybe, this futuristic society could do something about this problem? Because, no, the only thing he can think of doing is killing some children because the villain at the root of all the evil they chased for two films tells him he has the secret to immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course it does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. <br /> <br /> How can Lucas expect us to observe such nonsense and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi to kill him not because he was evil, but because he was pathetically stupid. <br /> <br /> Ah, by the way, Amidala eventually dies. During childbirth Why? Well, they don't know. The doctor, who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced, offers only the conclusion of "lost the will to live". Well, ok, of course it is. Perhaps in the end it occurred to her that girl was sleeping with her. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We present Kenobi for all this. He knows the birth of Luke and Leia. He knows who their father is and he knows what happens to them. He also knows the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, in several years, as Luke approaches manhood and presents with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO's mind is erased, but not R2's mind - why ????) stating "I think these droids belong to you "Kenobi, who knows that the protocol droid was built by the one who believed he was" the chosen one "and the apprentice of the Emperor himself, and that he was just built on this same planet, he says" strange, I don't remember owning some droids ". <br /> <br /> Oh good grief. <br /> <br /> Lucas simply invented everything as he walked. Once he introduced VAder as Luke's father, unfortunately the story began to spin out of control because he didn't know what the story was. The plot of episodes 1-3 is simply incomprehensible. No Palpatine had any rational sense. And none of this is tied to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It is an afterthought, and it seems. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a high score. It reminds me of Triple X. A film that is fun to watch, but completely forgettable. Star Wars will remain forever in my mind. Fortunately, this and the two previous ones will soon disappear.
