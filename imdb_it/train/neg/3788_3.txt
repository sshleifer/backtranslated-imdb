There is much to love here. The actors are first rate and the script provides a good dialogue to capture the atmosphere of a close-knit and nice family. However, for this reason the film does not sound true. We see that Leo, who apparently has just heard about his HIV diagnosis, essentially reacts in a way that is not in tune with the supportive atmosphere he is in for. Moreover, the film ends in a rather abrupt way avoiding what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have faced in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as is generally the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, the writers could not decide if they wanted an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional and engaging family or what was the devastation of HIV on the victim, so it only suggests to both. While this film offers food for thought, it leaves the viewer wanting much more than what it offers.
