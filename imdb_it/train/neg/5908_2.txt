This is a little better than the first. It still relies on much of his humor that basically continues to say that the old James Bond films were not realistic. Which gets thinner after so many parodies. The girls were more interesting in this. <br /> <br /> There is an enormous amount of total humor. We hope that one day the real comedy will return.
