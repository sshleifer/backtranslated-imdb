This will be short. Allow me first to state that I am agnostic and not exactly crazy for the Xtians, especially for Xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a tone similar to an adolescent angry with his mother Xtiana for not letting him play video games. I couldn't take it seriously. Does mentioning how Charles Sanson thought he was Christ to illustrate where xianity can generate evil? I don't know that it was just economic and childish - it made the opposition seem ignorant. Furthermore, the narrator seemed only snobbish and pretentious. The delivery was complete. I can't take this documentary seriously. I could appeal to an angry teenager who is pissed off by his Xtiana mother for not allowing him to play video games.
