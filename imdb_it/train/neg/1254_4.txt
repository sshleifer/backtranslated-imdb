I saw and enjoyed the original film and I expected more from a remake of this. <br /> <br /> GOOD: Effects and make-up are good. No complaints about the score and the images, they are adequate and the performances were fine (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principals were good, and a handful of "supporting secondary actors" did very well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BAD: The escape from the monkey city was terrible. The characters are going in circles, then suddenly somewhere in the city center there are tunnels to escape from. Also, which escape route leads through everyone's bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to include as many actions as possible. I like action scenes but the original film had more flesh and deserved more respect. <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending was completely meaningless as presented. Without seeing the inevitable sequel, there is no justification for this. <br /> <br />
