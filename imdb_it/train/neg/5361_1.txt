I saw this film when it was first released in the 70s and hated, hated, hated! Easily the most boaooring movie I've ever seen in my life. I don't know where Leigh got his inspiration, but this is one of those movies where you want to shake up the characters to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no moments of savings in this film, only long, long silences with people unable to express what (supposedly) feelings are. If you want to see something that drives you to drink, this is the one for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, place a fork in the toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasant than anything else you can get from this! Yes, Leigh had a lot of really useful things much later in his career, but he lacks this.
