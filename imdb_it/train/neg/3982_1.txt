For God's sake please don't watch this movie! It's a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this film and its predictable evil villain is simply lame. The characters are not developed and most of the film is enriched with shots of Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual film. Moreover, acting is a shame. I know everyone is trying to find their niche, but this is really a disaster. I can't believe someone actually paid many millions of pounds to put this film on the screen. Don't waste your money or time on this film, go see your grandmother or something useful instead.
