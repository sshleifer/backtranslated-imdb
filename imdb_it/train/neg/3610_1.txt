One patient escapes from a psychiatric hospital, killing one of his guardians and then a university professor after going to the local college. The next semester, the replacement of the professor and a new group of students face a new series of murders. The dialogue is so obvious that it is difficult to believe that you are able to foresee the quotation marks. This is one of those low-cost movies that was thrown together in the middle of the 80s slasher era. Despite killing the heroine, this is just poor garbage. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible !! "Splatter University" is only a small part to insert the video recorder when you have nothing better to do, even if I suggest you look at your tape head, which would be more fun. Skip and rent "Girl's Nite Out" instead. <br /> <br /> Rated R for strong graphic violence, obscenity, short nudity and sexual situations.
