REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is not a long lost ancestor of the classic zombie films of George A. Romero. This is a low-budget 1936 dishwashing machine that probably seemed very nice to the public of the moment ... but it seems terribly routine these days. There is actually a rather beautiful scene at the beginning of a soldier who shoots from the gun into a horde of approaching zombie soldiers ... and a close-up of bullets entering the bare chest of one of them. In these days the effect seems hopelessly false, but in 1936 I am sure that the public had a pant. The story is about finding the secret of mind control ... apparently to create an army of unstoppable zombies ... but later as a means for a character to win the woman he loves. The film lasts just an hour, but it moves at a snail's pace, so it looks like a feature film, believe me! There is really not much to recommend ... you could have fun from the fake studio shots of the "wading" star through a "swamp". The ending is interesting ... so I would say that the film deserves to be seen at least once. More than likely you will see it as an extra feature on a cheap "4 movie on 1 DVD" compilation at Wal-Mart for five dollars. Hey, it's worth the money ...
