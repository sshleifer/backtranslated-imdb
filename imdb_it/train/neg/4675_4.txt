"Washington Square" is a flat and scruffy adaptation of Henry James's short novel. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. Furthermore, his simple and uneventful story seems unsuitable for making a film of it (although William Wyler, with his "The Heiress", gave a beautiful version of the novel in 1949). <br /> <br /> However, the film completely betrays the spirit of this work by the great American writer. In the novel, the heroine Catherine is shy, not very attractive and very clumsy, but nevertheless she is a healthy and intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it might seem. His attachment to his father is dignified and respectful, with no morbid parts in it. Three quarters of the film, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) seems to be mentally retarded, poor thing. In the last quarter, suddenly (and incredibly) he becomes intelligent, aware of his dignity as a woman, and all the rest. <br /> <br /> Director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous little girl Catherine has, well, problems with her vesica. The second scene, when we see in the background a sort of outdoor brothel, with the prostitutes who bring their clients behind the curtains, and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to the spirit and artistic ideals of Henry James. It is known that the writer was extremely good and reserved even by Victorian era standards. I challenge anyone to find roughness anywhere in the thousands of pages of James's enormous literary production. I was particularly annoyed by these two scenes. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know that a director needs a reasonable freedom in the film adaptation of a novel. But if a director completely ignores or misunderstands the art of an author (here Henry James), I don't see the sense of using his work to make a bad film. <br /> <br /> The acting is adequate for the film: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely not a recommendable film.
