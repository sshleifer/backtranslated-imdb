Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors, who can certainly take on any acting challenge. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and the public: do not fall asleep during a boring story, very predictable and without imagination. <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' tries very hard to be funny, but the comedy is forced, extremely badly directed and embarrassing to the limit of complete ridicule. <br /> <br /> After a third of the film, nothing that can capture even the most available audience, like the friends and relatives of the director, is even mentioned, not to mention what really happens. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure everyone who liked it simulated it or had to pretend like Neil's ex-girlfriend did when he showed her an old black-and-white movie he couldn't care less about less. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is not at all close to category B, falls somewhere between Q & R, like -Questions? e - Try again the questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to bore the viewer to death, he did a great job! <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, please don't let it be a waste of time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
