I'd like to give this movie a zero out of ten, but I'll give it a two. The first is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. Last Point is that Rani appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal. I love Rani very much and I have the respect that she is a great actress. That's why I didn't like it in this movie that kisses Kamal, but it's not a big deal. In any case, enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film obvious, actually let this film speak. Okay or bad, I think it's a completely scruffy film that made me yawn. Being a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ reviews by clicking on my name, I have a great taste. The film is not funny is one thing and if it is supposed to hit the cinema hard, because there is no morality in this film. It is a distorted film that is not a true story and stinks. Watching Kamal kissing these actresses makes me sick, but the man can't kiss properly.
