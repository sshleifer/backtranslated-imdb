... am I missing something here ??? "unexpected plot developments"? "plot twist with subversive joy"? it is these spectators who look at the same Arquette vehicle I have just been subjected to (in a by now obvious (non) conscious attack of sadomasochism) ... I joined this site simply to make sure that no one else has ever rented this stinker. ..this film was embarrassing for every single person involved ... quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before giving thumbs up to Kate C.? if so, then it must be the same Spielberg who highlighted "Howard the duck" ... don't give me this, "it was a successful game" sucks - I imagine Mssr. Reddin is not very happy ... the DVD cover promised "surprising angles" and a "twisted story ..." History !! History ?? It's a shit like this that makes old Bobby McKee and his group of Structuralists look old ... Sundance ?? Berlin ?? Toronto ?? I have a video at home of my cat fart that evokes more interest than the negatively dimensional portrait of Arquette's anguished loss ... and, let's talk about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T; thank god, right at the right time he thought of calling the police Dave! and thanks to Shiva that the police had just captured the real murderer ... what !!! until the end credits I was still waiting for it to be a kind of bully against Arquette and his "hidden millions" ... no, Mrs. Spielberg, don't go out unharmed: what the hell was that cooking scene with "athlete's foot in my horse "gag ??? are you worse in this or "just cause" ?? I don't know ... Hey movie lovers: why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent it with "jersey girl" and "white chicks" and then commit sepukka (or seppuka) ... and get E. Dunsky with you ....
