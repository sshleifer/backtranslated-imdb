I'm so confused. What the hell was this movie about? What was the motivation of the killer? He looked pretty angry, but I still have to figure out why. Nothing in this film made sense. It had zero depth. Or less than zero depth. What I imagine would make it a hill. Or a flashlight. Shit. The acting was horrible. When I looked for some of the actors in this film, they had been on very few things I had heard of, and this was not absolutely surprising. I can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in such a bad movie, or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job. Starting . . NOW! (Reference Seinfeld.) In reality, though, don't waste your time with this. There is so little substance that there is nothing there just to make fun of. This was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher films - NO, one of the worst films of ANY KIND I have ever had the misfortune to watch, and I have seen quite a few.
