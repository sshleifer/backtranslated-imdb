he was my hero all the time until he went with {if you can call him a movie} I went to the show to watch him and go out and not just ask me for money back but I asked for double the money The acting of the hero and the what of the hole they were ............. I can't believe that Steven Segal's career was so low as to be reduced to making fourth-speed films with 5th-rate secondary actors. I watched this movement expecting to see it beetated by some people as it usually does. When it comes down to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to draw an opponent and the type falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is as incredible as a movie, and even if you excuse the graphic and read this story as a novel, you would be wondering why you even took the book. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal makes the moves and it looks like he is just doing this because he is obliged. It shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes it does not show up at all. I hate to repeat other people's comments, but the use of archive footage for cut scenes and images of flying planes is pathetic. The condition of those pieces cut into pieces is flickering and the scenes themselves seem to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing that President John F Kennedy has been murdered is more consistent and cleaner. <br /> <br /> My sincere opinion is to tell you not to waste your time watching this film, it is not up to the standards of its work in the brightest man or the wounds of leaving. I read a review that said the film had a budget of 12 million dollars (Segal paid 5) and that the film was still under budget. I must admit. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that it is a film directed on DVD, as no conscientious theater owner will interpret this film.
