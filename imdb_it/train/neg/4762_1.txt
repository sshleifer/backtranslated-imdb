I saw this movie without knowing anything about it in advance. The plot was terrible with large gaps in missing information. The film didn't have the "battle of the spirits" for me. The actors just threw up mouthfuls of nonsense, sometimes they made me grind my teeth in agony as they continued to buzz. The plot was predictable except for the homo-erotic scene in the sick stomach at the end (I'm not homophobic but it hurt me physically in the stomach), even the ending was predictable. And one could say that the detective was Jude Law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, the terrible dental work, the costumed facial hair, everything indicated that it was a disguise. The whole film seemed to waste time from my life. This film had the feeling of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as a window to see the show, really boooring in my opinion.
