Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys who spend time with everyone end up murdered in this generic 80s movie. It is up to the local city sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying and mysterious girl with two shoes, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mysterious and melodramatic aspects of the film and less on the murders themselves and therefore is able to differentiate itself from many of the Slasher brothers of the 80s. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a large body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by saying that the actress is over 18 and therefore I transmit that I am not excessively perverted). On the flip side of the coin, the film is hampered by some points of the plot that are underdeveloped and superfluous, a reticulated theme that is used a little too often and a finish that is a bit anti-climatic. But good overcomes evil (barely). Give him a rent, but I wouldn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My Grade: C <br /> <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: a introduction by star Aleisa Shirley and director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both the cut and theatrical version of Director of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos and Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals and Balalaika Conspiracy
