Go now and rent this movie. It will be on a shelf at the bottom of your local video store and will be covered in dust. No one has touched him for years. It could even be a special $ 50! It's worth ten dollars, I swear! Buy it! There are not many films that can be compared to this: the celluloid version of that goo that forms at the bottom of a garbage can after a few years. Yes, I gave a '1', but it really deserves a lot less. The 1-10 scales were not designed with this in mind.
