After sitting in the middle of this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered if it was actually the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a film. He was so listless and formulated. But US propaganda thrown in the face throughout the film demonstrates - disappointing - that it is the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but he cites "We must steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it", seems like a way to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spits out lines like: "I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip" made me ask my husband if the whole cast had taken Valium before shooting every scene. The "reasoning" behind every turn of the plot and the new "clue" are really ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there is also an accomplice negative side of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name being scolded by all concerned for "never closing". She is clearly in the film just to look, but they feel the need to slap a "Dr." title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, "Don't you ever shut up?" and the camera lights up her hands, like a child. Really grotesque. The only advantage of this film is that it is so incredibly ugly that it makes you laugh a little. The really scary thing is that the majority of people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy themselves. Horrifying....
