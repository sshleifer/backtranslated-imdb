Tasteless. I can't even write intelligently about the film. I laughed the whole movie. It didn't have to be fun. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he's doing. His story is written, apparently, without any knowledge of the Iowa culture and the methamphetamine problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, which makes his film even weirder for me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It makes no sense. The acting was mediocre at best and sometimes difficult to watch. Generous violence and sex filled the film. I imagine that violence and sex should have made the film edgy, but it turned out to be unbelievable and offensive. The film's ending is so brilliantly ugly that all I could do was laugh and look incredibly at the end credits. As I left the theater, everyone who was leaving laughed with me. The end of the film was intended to evoke tears, but did the exact opposite. Don't waste your time in this horrible movie, unless you want to see an ignorant, corny, forced, clich√©.
