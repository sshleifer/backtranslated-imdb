This is another depressing and boring film about AIDS and tragedy. It starts very quiet and predictable and continues throughout the film. I kept waiting for the withdrawal, but unfortunately it never happened. The acting is right, but the script requires VERY work. And if you're looking for nudity, don't waste your time with these not-so-exciting actors. Because of the poor sound quality and the lack of captions, I lost 1/8 of the movie. If you've never seen more than five gay movies, or you've recently come to terms with being gay, you might find this movie interesting, otherwise it's your low budget movie. It ranks as one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
