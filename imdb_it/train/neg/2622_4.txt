102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Believed to be cured, Crudelia de Vil (Close) is released from prison and is preparing to start over. Things are good for Crudelia who is committed to helping the homeless off the road. When the clock hits Big Ben, things go wrong. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she has always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close takes up his role as Crudelia de Vil and once again is the pride of the film. Every scene with her is worth watching in this dull sequel, which seems more like a repetition of the previous film, rather than a new story. <br /> <br /> She's Changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
