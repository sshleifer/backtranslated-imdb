I just watched this movie on Flix after recording it with the timer. I grew up watching F Troop and I had a big problem for Wrangler Jane, so I was shocked, literally shocked, to find out after watching this movie that the degenerate homicide nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks pretty good, but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I never imagined it was her in a million years. What the hell is he doing in a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the film lacks what it is pushing. No sex, no blood, no teasing. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or so). Most of the action is boring; the main character spends an enormous amount of time running around the house of the mad doctor and the basement, and the neighborhood in general, or being beaten by the policeman, all boring and full of time. Now, if the Italians had done it, half of the film would have been Slingblade's henchman / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam who was caressing unconscious naked girls. But you only take it for 20 seconds.
