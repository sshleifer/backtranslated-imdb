Gods ... where to start. I could only fall asleep for the first 10 minutes before turning it off in disgust. Apart from the actor who plays the same Robin Hood, the rest was simply terrible. And, I can only extend my suspension of disbelief until now. <br /> <br /> Since the opening of the first episode, I have lost count of how many mistakes, potholes and horrible costumes there were. He started with a poor farmer who was looking for a deer to feed his family. Everything good. However, the poor fighter had to be mostly deaf, because a handful of soldiers, fully armed, on horseback, managed to undermine him by about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> Then, as he runs away, he goes from having them 10 feet behind him, to a click where you can't even see them at all, immediately followed by them about 20 feet behind him again. Then, he runs into some bushes, and is immediately beaten by two soldiers ... who only a few seconds before were galloping on horseback, tens of meters behind him. <br /> <br /> The armor the soldiers are dressed so painfully evident that they tried to look like Maille and failed miserably. Not to mention the fact that the lead soldier's armor is about 5 sizes too big for the poor boy. Seriously, it looks like he's a small child wearing his father's too-large armor! Finally, Robin manages to shoot about 5 perfectly targeted rounds around a soldier's hand, in about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a curved bow. No living human being could make that kind of blows, in that short span of time, with a rifle gun, much less a bow. <br /> <br /> After that, they escape the soldiers and stop to help an incredibly well-dressed suit and clean "peasant" with digging a ditch ... something that all the nobles were willing to do all the time, quite right? Like this sorry excuse for a series I've ever had a second season is beyond me. Production costs (at least for what I've seen) must have risen to tens of dollars (or euros) ... <br /> <br /> Seriously - I think a high school theater lesson could have yielded best. It was so bad, even that terrible version of Kevin Costner of Robin Hood was better. I strongly suggest you skip this monstrosity and rent or buy the "Robin of Sherwood" series from the 1980s. Much better written, recited, in costume and product. <br /> <br /> For shame, BBC ... out of shame ...
