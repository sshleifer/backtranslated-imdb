can some films become more naive than this? you can't believe a piece of this script. and it is equally obvious that you can tell the plot and the end of the first 10 minutes. the lead actress seems to want to be Barbie (but she can't do it, the doll has more acting skills). <br /> <br /> the ease with which the character passes and remains in a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. I don't even want to comment on the superficiality of the characters, but the ONLY positive aspect of the film is Madsen's performance that manages to give life to a one-dimensional apple-like character. <br /> <br /> The film is so unkind that it sticks to the teeth. I can think of 13-year-old girls obsessed with Britney shouting "Oh, let's take a break! If we want fairy tales there's always the book of the Grimm brothers hidden somewhere in the attic". I gave 2 instead of just one for Virginia Madsen.
