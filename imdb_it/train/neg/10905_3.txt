Guy is a loser. I can't have girls, he needs to grow up, he is taken by stronger and more successful boys, etc. Seen, seen, moved. I have to say Rob needs to get past the Adam Sandler part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler's plots. There are two fun parts in the whole movie. I couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored "The Animal" is a good movie. I usually like Adam Sandler films that have the same storyline. But this was trying too hard to impress. The jokes are very old. So trust me. This is not a movie where most people could really enter. But some did, so I'll be kind. <br /> <br /> 3/10
