It is not so much that the SPONTANEA COMBUSTION has had little potential. In fact, the phenomenon of the unexplored title is rather intriguing and, at least half open, this effort by Tobe Hooper promises to entertain only the horror of the 90s. But somewhere between the performance of Brad Dourif and the overly complicated plot, this aspiring thriller makes its way. <br /> <br /> Dourif, presented here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated, is the average guy Sam. Obviously the average kids don't stay in horror movies for a long time, so after a well-made outline, we see that the various parts of Sam's body start to catch fire. Soon other people are turning on, much to the dismay of the galley Lisa, who was not memorably interpreted by Cynthia Bain. <br /> <br /> While the film's title implies a fiery monster in freedom, director Hooper has opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an additional human depth that would otherwise be lacking, but it also prevents us from really fearing the human flamethrower. We are wondering if this would have worked better as a real rogue-against-all effort NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET wing. <br /> <br /> SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is an almost nominal effort when all is said and done. It will bring further appeal to Dourif fans and those who can't get enough of the 90's horror, either for good, for bad or in between, but only on a slow night.
