I warn you here: I chose to believe those reviewers who stated that this is not an action film in the ordinary sense, rather than a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on this basis and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I am here to tell you that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not completely; it's very disappointing if you're looking for an action movie, they were right about that. But it is also very unsatisfactory on all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer wasn't so bad, I suppose, not worse than usual; but what did he have to make Billy Zane sit in this? Was it a kind of death wish from the producers? A way to make their film a guaranteed flop? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If in reality you were aiming for success, then why not launch someone capable of acting? Oh, and it could even go for a writer who knows how to write. Ah yes, and a director who knows how to direct. <br /> <br /> As someone who has sat in this mess, really believing that he would soon be redeemed, I can assure you that it never happened. Too bad, it could have been a good movie.
