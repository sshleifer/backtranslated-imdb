The sects that capitalize on this film are well known for their claim to take the 'message' of the Bible without any extra-biblical alteration or influence. The existence of this film is due solely to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what the branch of Christianity reborn in the seventies was born in, look at the word "kidnapping" in a dictionary of seven and seven. It's faster than going through this celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, uneven sound quality and a script that could be just as easily written by Jack T Chick (paranoid theorist of the Christian conspiracy for those not familiar with the evangelical scene). You can't really put this in the "so bad is good" category, so its only audience are those with a collection of brochures that try to expand or extremely paranoid.
