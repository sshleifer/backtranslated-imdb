I feel like I'm the only guy in town who was annoyed by Branagh's performance. He's a good actor from most of the stories, but he simply couldn't get the southern accent. I mean, it was regrettable. It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Yank. One of the previous reviewers questioned why US actors were not cast in this film. According to this concept. It's wonderful that actors / actresses want to expand their horizons, but it's another thing to try too hard for a performance to get tense. Maybe it was Altman, but he's such a great director ... <br /> <br /> Well, I really don't want to hit Branagh too much for his absolutely horrible accent. Everyone deserves to ruin here and there. But it's hard to look at something so annoying that you'd rather choke on a chicken bone or eat a bucket full of shit rather than sit at The Gingerbread Man.
