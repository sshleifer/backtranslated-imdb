I didn't care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** this was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. so now I look like a dummy, but I think I will continue to send my comments. and yes, British Columbia is quite a *** Or why did they take it from its setting on the South Carolina Coast? (this question is) The place was essential to the plot of the book and its change was part of my disappointment for the film. Oh, I just read where I have to write at least ten lines. Here is my other main problem with the film. Kim Bassinger was too dull and not at all what I imagined from the book. I know, the book was the book and the film; well not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also evokes rustic, almost primitive images of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the feeling of the story and seemed at odds with the characters.
