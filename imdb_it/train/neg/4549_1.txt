Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of a teacher out of work in a mysterious village in Peru. Quality home video actors present the so-called characters that emit exaggerated exposure and a metaphysical hokum, while the film is driven by the extremely heavy direction of Armand Mastroianni. Although there are visible attempts to measure and interesting fans of stronger dishes in the compartments of ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "Da Vinci Code", the directors are not up to it. This film stinks of ill-conceived spiritual propaganda for mass consumption, and the results are so horrible that few manage to overcome this mess to find a real point.
