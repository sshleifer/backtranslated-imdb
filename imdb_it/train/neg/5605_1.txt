I was VERY disappointed with this movie. I expected more from a female crime film Thelma and Louise. Instead, the women's prison escapes in this film, it has no sense of mutual loyalty. They were a bunch of extremely vulgar hyenas, which beat each other, crossed each other and even committed lesbian rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of being frowning thieves who joined together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money, the escaped women were too selfish and evil to trust each other for a long time . These women have not been released in a positive sense. They ended up being a bunch of loose cannons, incapable of respect for themselves or each other. If you like female criminal movies from the 70s, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, with Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
