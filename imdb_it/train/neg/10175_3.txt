I can't go to sleep the other night. So I got up, turned the tube around and this movie was active. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers bit more than they could chew. The same ambitious scope as "Forrest Gump". But Gump read like a fairy tale in which an extraordinarily lucky man leads us through the era. TGMB simply relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical where the actors have to silence him. The purpose of each character was to fill a stupid 60s archetype. <br /> <br /> Find out how Finnegan presents us: Embrace his black maid and get a framed photo of MLK. Crime, talk about heavy hands. Why not give him a shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Isn't it a free love groovay, man? Oh no, I didn't have my period." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not to UCLA square." Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about LA in the 1960s. Rather than taking the time to show what made Berkeley unique, we only hear this ugly lament for not going there. <br /> <br /> I can't even remember the name of the black guy. It was just a prop used to show how other children tolerated the breed. <br /> <br /> The thing is that period pieces should not be so trivial. Take "Dazed & Confused". See how the football hero Randall Floyd is introduced to us. We don't see him for the first time on the soccer field. In reality, we never see him play soccer. He is introduced to us in class, inviting his nerdish poker friends to a party. <br /> <br /> In feminism "Dazed" is not a random byproduct of a girl getting pregnant. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It is refined in the women's room for a discussion on Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most trivial settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the hot comments here note that the themes of this film are still relevant. I agree! That's why I feel so disappointed with this piece of pornography of Baby-Boomer.
