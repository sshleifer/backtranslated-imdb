I wanted to vote for zero or less. I loved the comment. It's the worst movie ever made and "unbearable" is the perfect word for this, unless there's something worse that Roget never thought of. I can't even think of anything negative enough to accurately describe Bo Derek. The best thing that can be said about her is that it is consistent.
