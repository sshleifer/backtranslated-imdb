Yes, this film is a real thief. He stole some obscure Oscar from Avatar just because the politicians wanted another movie of war heroes to increase acceptance (support?) Of the wars the US is still fighting today. I really don't want to go here in politics, but come on, this is clearer than the summer sky. The injured cabinet actually has nothing exceptional, no real plot. I really feel in the 1950s in Hungary when the party told people what they wanted and what they didn't want. The same propaganda films were produced that time, except that those were in black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the kind "wars in the United States are fantastic", you surely have much better films to choose from.
