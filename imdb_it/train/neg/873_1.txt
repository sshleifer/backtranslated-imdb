A manager, very successful in his professional life but very incapable of family life, meets a boy with Down syndrome who has fled a residence. Both characters feel very lonely, and the seemingly less intelligent will show the executive the beauty of the little things in life ... With this discussion, the somewhat amelistic atmosphere and the sentimental music, I didn't expect it, but a disgusting moralist film. However, since there were interesting scenes (the boy is sometimes quite violent), and the interpretation of both actors, Daniel Auteil and Pasqal Duquenne, was very good, I decided to continue watching the film. French cinema, in general, has the ability to show something that seems very alive, in contrast to the more stereotyped American cinema. But, because of this, it is much more disappointing to see after the final absurdity, with the boy's impossible death, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive family, the economic morality, the unbearable laughter of the daughters, the boy greeting the sky like Michael Landon ... Really unpleasant, in my humble opinion.
