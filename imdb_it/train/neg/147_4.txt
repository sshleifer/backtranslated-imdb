"Valentine" is another horror film to add to the list of "stalk and slash" movies (I think of "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Scream" and "I know what you did last summer"). It's certainly not as good as those movies I've listed, but it's better than most of the scams that came out after the first "Friday 13" movie. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian "My Bloody Valentine", which I hated a lot. "Valentine" is a better film than that, but it's not saying much. The plot: a nerdy kid is teased and mocked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later, when those classmates have all grown up, then they are chosen one by one. It is assumed that the killer is the kid now grown up looking for revenge. But is he? Or could it be someone else? "Valentine" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a lackluster script doesn't really do it justice. There are some moments of fear anyway, however. <br /> <br /> ** (out of four)
