Who created this piece of shit is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, it's a waste of time and money. I hate the way they create low-budget sequels with D-Lister actors and a plot so similar to the first. <br /> <br /> I found this movie in the discount basket right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $ 2.99 what a fool I was to think this could be good, instead I looked disgusted as poor stereotypes recitatives torn from the plot and script of the first. <br /> <br /> Whoever thought it was right - video production was actually just half-decent, you have to be on crackd or something, because I think pretty much most people who have seen this film do you think A LOAD OF CRAP !!!!
