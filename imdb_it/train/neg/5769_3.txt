Elephants Dream was to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it actually failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only saving factor. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of the blossoming light. It's horrible, although I think it helps give the film a dreamlike quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is the terrible vocal acting. While the Proog voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I imagine that when you have a budget that is basically zero, you can't afford to hire real voice actors. It seems to me that they have hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not going anywhere. It seems to me that it is more a movie "look what we can do" instead of a real movie. The plot does not go anywhere and really fails to show any interesting points. The whole film seems to have been made as an excuse to create interesting areas. <br /> <br /> Overall, it might be worth downloading it from the official website, but don't expect anything but a nice graphic.
