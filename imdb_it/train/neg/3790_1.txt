He actually didn't post comments, but I wanted to make sure to warn people about this movie. It is an unfinished student film without saving features. On a technical level, it is completely amateurish - constant involuntary modification of jumps inside scenes, wild dubbing, etc. The plot is completely clichÃ©, the structure is ridiculous and the acting is embarrassing. I don't want to be too hard: I did my share of student films, and they were all terrible, but there's no reason why this movie is out in the world where innocent fans will have to see it. /> <br /> Safe assumption that - much like the cast - the positive comments are directors, friends and family.
