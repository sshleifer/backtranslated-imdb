The badly done "blaxploitation" crime drama directed at the black market in the early 1970s. Pam Grier is the protagonist of the protagonist's role, that of a nurse who becomes a vigilante to a woman after the drug-addict thugs make Coffy's little sister an addict. Violent nonsense follows one another tenaciously, with canned energy and excitement; only the captivating temperament of Grier shakes the narrative (it's not very actress here, but connects with the audience in a primordial way). Not much different from what Charles Bronson was doing at the time, the film was marketed and advertised as a gross exploitation but still managed to find a sizable audience in the city center. Today, however, it is only a footnote in the history of the 70s, and lacks the broad appeal of other films of this genre. * 1/2 from ****
