Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent my money on. It was a bad choice for all these big stars to waste their reputation. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way. No acting talent shown - just reading a part. Alec can normally play realistic characters, Gwynyth has become ugly for an insignificant part, Annette needs advice on how to choose the movies she chooses to play, as do all these big stars who left me disappointed by the way they allowed all of them talents to choke in a function that leaves much to be desired in fun. "Running with scissors" leads the public to anticipate acting in a film that suggests experiencing deep tension and emotions. There was not a moment when the cast was able to interpret any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ... anything.
