The opening scenes move smoothly like the frozen velveeta. The attempt at dramatic dialogue just makes me want to have better control of the fast forward control. Vampires are usually depicted as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. Usually I count a body count, so there was a cat (which does not count) a tramp, a girl who fell from the sky with a sword in her (whatever it was) and then the plot. Foley's artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting an apple for a vampire who bites a victim is simply silly. I liked Warlock, but this movie was so bad that it turned it off, and it was so forgettable that we rented it a year later just to turn it off again.
