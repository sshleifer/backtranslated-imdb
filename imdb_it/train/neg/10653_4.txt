One two three four five six seven and back, haha. This is a must see, first of all to see the work. There is a lot of work out, see those close-ups, you will like man. A video clip was certainly based on this film a few years ago. It's a slasher but without suspense. Even the ending is fun, and the clothes he wears in the wood in front of the copper, Jesus, looks like a clown. The killings are mostly done off the screen, the blood flows but never too bloody. There are also many fight scenes, and hey, nobody got hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, never seen one so big, it won't ruin it, you have to see it. And being a slasher there is also a lot of T & A. To guess who the killer is you will be trapped a couple of times and this is the best part, but as for the history of copper in the woods, eh! But despite his generosity, this is still one that many would like to have. I'm glad to have my copy, one of those failures. But man, those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles! If you are 40, this is one that has come to mind.
