The French film "Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte" directed by iconoclast filmmaker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq. He also worked on the scenery of this film. According to the British film magazine Sight and Sound, it is also known as "Whatever". This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers. The film is ruined with his too obvious voice that the main character introduces us to. This makes us feel as if we were looking at a book that has been read. The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine, but the film gets out of hand when the hero begins to tell the suffering faced by him and his friend. Instead of sticking to the main theme, the film turns in other directions to its ruin. Attention: some women may find not only the film but also its two heroes as moral misogynists.
