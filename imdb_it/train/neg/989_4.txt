Okay so I discovered this movie and saw the preview read almost all the reviews and I had trouble discussing whether I should watch it or not. Before I even saw the movie I was emotionally weird. I was so insecure if I was going to watch this and be disturbed for a long time. So I chose to take a risk and looked and here's what I thought: the beginning started well for me. He seemed to be headed in a decent direction. I passed the rape scene and couldn't understand why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Don't get me wrong, the rape scene was just as sad and scary, but it didn't really bother me in a dramatic point. Then, when the medium arrived, I realized the boring stuff that was happening. There were only 5 minutes of photos of nothing but people running around saying or showing nothing! its only thing is to have a shot in which a person shows some kind of emotion but this movie did not have this. There were about 3 of these useless scenes, where you see the main character that Maya lost control, but didn't show it the right way to keep me going. Then, when she got into the hardcore party, it wasn't so boring, but still a little boring. Oh and by the way, Rosario Dawson did a great job anyway. Ok, so let's get to the end, after an hour of uselessness towards the center, revenge comes to Maya's attention. Here's where it was disturbing. I didn't feel bad for him or anything got what he deserved, but the whole scene was really scary and I just heard it all after. I can't really tell you whether or not you watch this movie because it's like this ... I don't know if I can't find a word to summarize. But if you choose to watch it, don't drain.
