The Lives of the Saints begins with an atmospheric London vision as a bustling city of busy and picturesque streets and sunshine. I was hoping that he would keep this atmosphere, but he gets bogged down in a story that is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> Othello works for the big, fat Mr. Karva, his criminal stepfather At least I think that's what he should be because he's never really defined, but he drops kittens in deep burdens, so trust me, he's an idiot) doing erroneous commissions while his fat girlfriend gives dad a job. One of his colleagues is Runner, a black guy who always runs from A to B. Until the day he runs into a dumb homeless child who gives him the desire to be able to stop running. The runner unloads the lost boy in Otello's apartment, where he promptly begins to grant more desires. Eager to satisfy some of his wishes, Karva kidnapped the boy. But he is not sure what happiness would bring him. Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another manual work? Anyway, I don't want to see the kid give him the second one. <br /> <br /> It only takes centuries to move forward and there are lots of repetitive scenes. The ending tries to be shocking but since there is almost no background on investing in any of these characters it only serves as an exit for the bored audience. <br /> <br /> The writer Tony Grisoni, a favorite of Terry Gilliam, tries to blend into some kind of religious allegory that ends up being as pretentious as all hell, ironically. If he had given us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters who suddenly behaved strangely then it would have been a more enjoyable film. As it is, we are introduced to a pile of annoying grumbles that miraculously then seem to develop intelligence in front of the mysterious boy. Who are the origins are never revealed. It's simply irritating! <br /> <br /> Apart from the sporadic moments of the atmosphere and a soundtrack, this film has little to recommend.
