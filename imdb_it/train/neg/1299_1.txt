This production has absolutely no plot. The acting is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand should not add this film to her CV. His acting is far from flawless and I personally think that you have crossed the boundaries of professional decency; in relation to the way it is exhibited in this film. This film contains too much useless nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and vulgar language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (like most films). Don't worry about watching this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, who has proven to be better with her close to the screen.
