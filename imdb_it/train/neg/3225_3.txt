Children love dinosaurs. It's a bit part of their culture. But they have The Land Before Time. The original. At least that movie had a heart. This. This film is simply pathetic. Just because kids love dinosaurs doesn't mean you can just slap an old story and show it to children. This film has no plot, the whole premise is stupid, and it's more from the stuff of numbers. Not like a sucking soul like Theodore Rex, but it's far from being an Earth ahead of time.
