The disappointing and decidedly boring film of the crime that misinterpreted the lead actor Jeremy Renner languidly whispers his role in the role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the most recognizable degenerate / serial killers of the last century. Released directly to the video in early 2003, "Dahmer" is an openly chatty, boring, misinterpreted and bloodless aperitif of a real dramatic drama that never delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the deceased mass murderer as if had the perfectly good potential to do! What he does, however, the attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is to evoke a sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by painting him out to be what ultimately is a solitary homosexual loser, nebbishy and seriously inept socially inept who was simply looking for love in all the wrong places in contrast to the cold, calculating and depraved sick and mad that he was! Overall, "Dahmer" from 2003 is one of those that true crime lovers everywhere could even skip because I'm not kidding when I say it's one of the worst biopic serial-killers ever made! It's even more irritating than other pathetic and exploitable "straight-to-video" rejections like "Gacy", "Bundy", "Ed Gein" and "The Night Stalker"! (Turkey-Zero Stars)
