I saw this film at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the great Dr. Uwe Boll present. <br /> <br /> The film is simply very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll "so bad actually is fun" way, but just plain bad. The plot is about a man who leads a terrible life (due to a previous criminal past, apparently), can't find a job, and with a horrible seventy-five-pound wife. This man turns to his uncle of worship in a plan to steal a truck loaded with toys that contain bird flu. Al Qaeda also has drawings on how to steal toys, and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence. <br /> <br /> The acting is horrible (except Dave Foley, who really tries, despite everything), the jokes never rise above the children who are hit in the chest in slow motion, and the people who take a poop. It should be satire, but I'm not sure what. <br /> <br /> Think "Plane!", but made by the creators of South Park, and without jokes.
