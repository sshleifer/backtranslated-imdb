Don't get me wrong, I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy. Now I will digress. However, writing was not realistic. A PTA mother who took care of drugs but was convinced that her drugs ended up in the hands of a minor. Give me a break. The complacency of the very nice character of Mary Louise Parkers was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not nice at all. Basically, the lines of the plot didn't go anywhere. I understand his only TV land. The hypocrisy was shameless. Mary Louise Parker should be a great mom and I should believe it ... WHY ???? I had the feeling of having been preached by a show that smelled of seeds. It's like saying it's OK to cheat your wife, but with someone of legal age. OK, not exactly the same thing, but I think people understand my point. I imagine that saving children's stuff is wonderful for electoral journeys, but it doesn't hold water in a cable sitcom about a suburban mother, like the local potentiometer.
