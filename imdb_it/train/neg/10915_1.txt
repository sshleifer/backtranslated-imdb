I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda barely makes the first one. Zvezda being a Russian war movie, I expected patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, a lush score, Slavic cheeks and cruel Germans. What I didn't need was the naive non-business love, the incredibly silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) only end up passing but insulting however our sense of history which speaks of the "liberation of Poland". A missed opportunity as a film but not as apparently propaganda.
