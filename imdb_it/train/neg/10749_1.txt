This film was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump over me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple of trees and bushes. Not scary whatsoever. Flashing news, if you're shooting in the Southern California area, the giant bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there. <br /> <br /> 2. Writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I ever had. Every possible line in the film was not original, clich√© or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "blood of the field" (lame), the clown's name is "the killer clown" (lame). What does a clown do in a forest anyway? Was it the only mask they could find? 3. The last, but certainly the least, was acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of lines of shit and mediocre acting. The worst thing was by far when he then came back to peek randomly at this fat foreign girl who was undressing for a photograph. It's a very long scene and I guess it should have been sexy, but it wasn't like that. Also, and this was one of the few fun parts of the movie for me, it was this tool that should be "athletic". For example, when he is bored in the film, he grabs a couple of stones and starts making curls with them. Then, afterwards, he should run for the clown and it is immediately clear with his "girlish" run, which is far enough from being athletic. Oh, and the girl who played Kat, the good god stops singing. That song you sang for the end credits makes me want to kill myself. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you see this film, I would at least recommend looking at the special features. The group of donkeys who made this film talk about it as if it were this truly original story. In fact, one of the girls says she allowed some of her friends to read the script and none of them could foresee the ending. Apparently she hangs out with special children.
