I once used the name of Wesley Snipes as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untried movie in which it appears. So now, for the first time, my recommendation on the Snipes-film method has failed. Absolutely. I should have come here to see these reviews. <br /> <br /> Snipes should be ashamed to allow their otherwise expensive efforts to be so wasted on "The Contractor". <br /> <br /> One of these my worst flick fears have come to bitterness. I feared that the style of directing, editing and editing "not consecrated", blurred, blurred, pseudo-documentary (first brought to my attention by "Bloody Sunday" directed by Paul Greengrass) could spread to other films. The disgusting style of Greengass was then brought to new sickening heights in the last two films of the Bourne trilogy. My fear had come true. In my opinion, these films are really badly made by these methods that lead to the malaise of the movement, which exchange fuzzy smears for "improvement of the action". But the "Bourne Franchise", as affectionate Greengrass calls his cow, seems to have convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the search for a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Read my lips, you guys in Hollywood. The action must be clearly photographed and presented, not only suggested by poor and lazy cinematographic techniques. <br /> <br /> And "The Contractor" comes to emulate "The Bourne Ultimatum" in soundless repetitive bites, in the hope that their young (apparently valued) audience may not perceive them. For example, if I hear a crackling "Yankee-Romeo" police radio again, I'll just scream. The odds are good. I won't feel it anymore: certainly I'll never see "The Contractor" again. <br /> <br /> I recommend to all those who have not yet seen "The Contractor": just settle for the tranquility that this lack offers to your life. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10; I'm tempted to lower it to 1.
