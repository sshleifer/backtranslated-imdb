BE WARNED. This film is such a mess. It's a catastrophe. Don't waste time with this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, history, dialogue, music ... pretty much everything is so exaggerated, absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It made me want to vomit (if dialogue / acting / history didn't do it, everyone was hit wrong). You'll feel like you're watching a play. The problem is that the seemingly fun parts aren't even fun. The acting, the story, the cinematography, you can feel that everything is only looking for WAAAAY too difficult - but it never happened. Virtually every shot is inclined, but then?! This film looks like a student film. No wonder they shot this in HD because it would have been a waste to spend more money to shoot this movie. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy yourself easily or you like acting, writing, editing, directing, full of clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh, and I mentioned poor acting? (well, actually, it's not the whole actor's fault - he's the director!), so I guess you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to watch it for a lesson. I would have turned it off immediately if I could. If you still can't say it, I hated this movie. It made me want to vomit and take my time ... at least I didn't have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the Jurassic Park / Independence Day guy, it's in this movie but he's definitely gone downhill since then, accepting roles for movies like this catastrophe.
