I'm usually not the type to be scared of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. a bit like this film came to mind !!! it is a very simple film but at the same time extremely effective, it has a great atmosphere and this leads to some shocking moments, the father of the girls coming down the hill is a true champion. Another visa was the family photo that I did not expect and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend everyone to see this movie, with the lights off it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
