OK, I knew it would be an F-movie backend (well below B-movie standards), so I thought, "Man, I could use a good laugh, so we see that some inferior beings kill each other. "Well, what I found might have been found in your" love toy "store. Lesbian random scenes, very little fighting, and no plot. <br /> <br /> For example, one particular scene that I remember (for its sheer stupidity, I saw porn on ABC better) is where the two main characters (I can't remember their names in order) ... great movie, eh?) are driving, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's pull over, I'm tired, you want to take the check? "Passenger:" Sure, I can drive for a while. " (Once pulled, the driver starts to grab the passenger's tits) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "All right, everyone does it sooner or later." Passenger: "OK then". (Proceed to take off the shirts, caress, kiss and perform fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked, the horror movies weren't in the Hollywood Video porn section (unless you deal with S & M, so go elsewhere), and certainly shouldn't be in the mainstream Blockbuster videos. Do not get me wrong; I'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but I only watch it when it's appropriate and I definitely don't want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in mainstream stores, since what I rented was from one of the two retailers I called (and probably also of the other if I had gone to look). <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and should only be bought for a public mastering ceremony. If I could give him a 0, I'd do it, but I can only give him a * of 10.
