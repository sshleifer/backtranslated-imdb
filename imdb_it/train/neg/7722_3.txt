Extremely mediocre action film with the always wooden Dolph Lundgren and Brandon Lee trapped in a shoulder role that never seems to gel. The action is average at best, a bit of nudity thrown in and yes Tia Carrera uses a double body! <br /> <br /> The set-up is the usual renegade cop forced to break a new partner on a big case, the producers at least try to make a change to the formula, making Lundgren the policeman with oriental values ​​and Lee the modern city slicker but the development of the character is null, which makes it almost comical, the clothing of eastern warrior Lundgrens for the big showdown must be seen to be believed. The action sequences are based on numbers and Lee (who would continue to make the excellent The Crow) never had the purpose of showcasing a particular martial arts genius. But given his illustrious relationship, he must have been subjected to a lot of pressure and it was far better not to be forced to live with his father by taking on a very different role in The Crow, which showed that only actor could have become if not for his tragic and untimely death. <br /> <br /> Unless you are an avid Lundgren fan or a fan of poor 80s-style action movies (think Cobra etc.) then avoid. <br /> <br /> Poor 3/10
