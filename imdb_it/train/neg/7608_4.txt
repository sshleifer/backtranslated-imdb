I admit I don't expect much from a Roger Corman film. Generally, I expect a lot of steps and bad scripts. Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The Gunslinger is the story of a woman (played by bubbly Beverly Garland) who takes over as a sheriff after her husband was brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a beautiful girl herself, killing one of the killers the next day at her husband's funeral. His first task is to close the local bar that is violating the curfew of the city. The bar owner is trying to buy land waiting to be bought from the (desired) railroad. However, Mrs. Garland is a thorn in her plan, and the matron at the bar hires a man to kill Mrs. Garland. <br /> <br /> As Ms. Garland plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to the lines of Suzanne Somers "She's the Sheriff". With the exception of a couple of missteps (the door to the apartment that opens from the inside, the jeep tracks and the two riders waiting on the screen for their inspiration to go around the corner), the film becomes quite passable like the cinema. However, Corman could not resist filling his film with riding scenes, just as he walks in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that The Gunslinger is an equine work that is worthwhile.
