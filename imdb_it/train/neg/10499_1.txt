Ok, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You have been loved by many fans. Now ... this movie was not a movie at all. It was the television program "The Crocodile Hunter" with bad recitations, bad scripts and bad direction between Steve who captured or taught us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker / specialist. Millions will be missing. But the whole idea of ​​the film was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, almost non-existent. The casting was horrible. The acting was not even worth the trouble of elementary school-level actors. The management must also be defective. If you can't get a decent performance halfway between your actors, it doesn't matter how bad the script is, in the first place you don't have to be that good. I could have written a better script. I wish I'd never been to see this movie. Of course, I saw it for $ 3 ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son). While I was out with friends who insisted on seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so scrupulous, liked the film, but he never asked to see it again. If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin, buy his DVD series. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. Respect it: avoid this movie!
