this film is, despite its "independent" status, a stupid Hollywood version of a sickly mother-daughter relationship. at first it wasn't so bad, but somewhere during the course of the film - more or less at the time when her daughter goes out with that guy, I think - she turns into a filmy video of a mother-daughter. I'm sorry, but I don't know of any mother who has that kind of relationship with her daughter ... it's probably better that way though.
