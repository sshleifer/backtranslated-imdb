I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured watching this movie. It is so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you cannot simply suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher working in a new Porsche and eating with his team in a restaurant that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. What kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It just gets worse. Towards the end, when the bad guy starts killing the good guys, this latter group acts so stupid that they want to die, in order to purify the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer can buy the money - and the main actors have been fantastic in other films, but the script and the direction are cruel here. Many people have wondered if there was any deliberate intelligence behind previous Paul Verhoeven films, foolishly fake (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this film should stop marveling. It is simply bad.
