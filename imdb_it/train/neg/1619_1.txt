At the beginning of the film, the beautiful photography and fox scenes were incredible. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the child begins to tame the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing that anyone should know is that it leaves wild animals to be wild and enjoy them from afar. This film is a terrible example for the children who will watch it, in an attempt to turn a wild creature into a domestic animal. I don't know what the point of the story would have been. Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the girl still wanted to play with the kits. Will he never learn his lesson? And there are other scenes with predatory fox animals, which only add to the trauma inflicted on the children watching this film. What a disappointment this film was. And what a horrible story he says. The final narrated dialogue was so stupid, when my wife and I were screaming on TV! I absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone!
