Let me give you a quick summary of the film: a rotten and rude boy named Max runs into a radio that contains Kazaam: a rap genius. Like all geniuses, he grants 3 wishes but, being kind-hearted, he also helps Max in his personal life, given that he has to deal with bullies and a father confused with organized crime. During all this, Kazaam does raps from time to time, (also showing Shaq's skilled rap skills). <br /> <br /> This film demonstrates what we all know: athletes must stick to sports. I admit it never seemed like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, dialogue is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would still be a joke. I know the movie designed ANYBODY just because Shaq was so big (no pun) at the time. I honestly can't think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have taken the time to shoot this film towards the practice of free throws.
