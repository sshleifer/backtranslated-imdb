Tenants Two writers struggle to complete their books in a condominium anything but empty. At first they help each other and then slowly the tension between them starts to grow. <br /> <br /> It is based on a novel by Bernard Malamud and unfortunately everyone talks as if they were in that novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, it is purple and rich in nuances of meaning. It's like a college Englishman with a head full of pretensions writing the script. It's terrible and I found myself immediately immune to anything the film had to say, which is a shame as the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog on down is an excellent shape, unfortunately none of them can overcome the falsity of words and premises. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend this movie. Although not exactly ugly, he is very preacher and pretentious to the point of making you want to leave. I lost interest less than a third of the way and I had to fight to get to the end. If you're interested, I'd try it on cable, but I wouldn't want to spend money to see it.
