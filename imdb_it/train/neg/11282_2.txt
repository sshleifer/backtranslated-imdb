In the wake of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, the British film industry is quickly overrun with bad gangster films between the late 1990s and early 2000s, which today seem even more desperate than they did then. In one of the greatest cases of pig pearls of all time, the producers of Rancid Aluminum have brazenly dissected the quote "The best film of the century" from a review to all the advertisements omitting the rest of the sentence emphasizing that it was just because, at the time of writing, it was the only film released in 2000. Looking at it today it's hard to imagine how it was ever made, combining a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannia's Lads Mags Brigade ?? Rhys Ifans, Sadie Frost, Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes ?? but now only a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel. The fact that the plot is never explained could be due to the possibility that nobody really knows what it is, or maybe it just doesn't think it matters. Something that has to do with the Ifans businessman with Steven Berkoff's Russian homicidal criminal in a money laundering or investment program (it is never clear which nobody will ever ask) the Irish accountant of Fiennes, who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his bankrupt company. From there on, things become increasingly confused and inexplicable, Ifans alternates between screams about how terrible his life is while juggling at the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and the Russian temptress of Tara Fitzgerald, accentuated by the Shimmering, Berkoff continues to say "Bizniss" and "Francis" Drake "and Fiennes makes a decent Irish accent by showing that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love doesn't mean he's a good writing judge when it comes to scripts. <br /> <br /> When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr, you know a movie is in trouble, with Poland looking for a Russia full of people with Polish accents and a strange soundtrack that it goes from John Barry's pastiche to Ennio Morricone's lounge music to spaghetti, with a budget for stylopono, completely fails in the most beautiful post that aims and ends a curious overplotted but almost plot m eno limbo all his own, sitting there like a joke dog jerk.
