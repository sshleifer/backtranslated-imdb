The television productions at the beginning of 2000 were between weak and bad. Before brands like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives or Monk) TV still didn't have the right shot, which could capture the attention and interests of the viewer of the 2000s. Titles like (Relic Hunter), ( Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least time like what preceded them was not appealing and interesting. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, it is Men in Black who meets the X Files parody! (As if these were the special unit 1). But also according to this brilliant formula; it didn't work well It was promising; at the time there was a certain saturation of the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X files already, so the natural spirit also ridicules too much (imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). However (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or a fort when it came to making a comedy science fiction show. It was highly ridiculous, where for example every sexy situation had to turn into an ugly and disgusting one. He enjoyed that nasty taste disgustingly. (Michael Landes) was not charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any alleged sexual attention, was all languid. Of course the show looks funny, but overall it was a little fun. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than his main idea. Among other works by Evan Katz as co-author and co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24), this must be a low point! Despite his distinctive personality, he managed to be a stupid joke most of the time. So if that was their goal, so they made one of the most stupid! And really, it would be one of the rarest moments of being thankful for the cancellation of a show after only 19 episodes!
