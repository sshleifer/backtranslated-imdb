Could you be the director of Do not Look Now or Bad Timing? Discouraged <br /> <br /> recited, modified clunkily. You just have to compare the various scenes of the accident in this with similar ones in Don't watch now to see how much Roeg has lost his touch <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> Even the most reliable Teresa Russell (seems a little big these days, I'm afraid to report) can't save this. The plot is pure pseudo-religious hokum, the recitation is of wood and the attempts of Roeg for its characteristic dislocation of the time are pitiful. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague.
