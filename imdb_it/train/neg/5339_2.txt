OK, so I'm like most people, give me free tickets and I'll go see a lot of things, now that the multiplex cinemas are so good (I remember the old single-screen flea cinemas and I'm the healthy side of 40). In England this film was released as "Liar", is a dog. It is a total waste of good celluloid. 4/10 for photography and set only.
