This is really a terrible movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life. At the same time it is bland and offensive, with nudity and so much violence. However, nudity is not so exciting and violence is repetitive and boring. Furthermore, the plot is at its best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie should be fun, but it's not. I didn't laugh once while watching him, nor did I smile a little. The creators of this film have tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and have failed on both counts. <br /> <br /> Some badly made movies are fun because they are so bad, but this is not one of them.
