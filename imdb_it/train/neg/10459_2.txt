A disconnected script, unclear, bad, poor photography and direction ... all in all very clearly a first ill-conceived attempt to make commercial films by the good people of TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has had great success in the past helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate error. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programs and loved "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone. They do very well with their ministry, but this is not an example of this. Don't waste your money ... go and rent "China Cry" instead.
