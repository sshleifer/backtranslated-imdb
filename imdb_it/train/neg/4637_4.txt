The Bangville police allegedly marked the debut of the Keystone Kops, from the name of the studio they worked for. In this case, however, they do not dress up with the stupid policeman's costumes or drive the hectic car that is their trademark. However, Mabel Normand is a peasant here who pleaded with her father for a calf. He later sees some strange men in the stable and quickly calls the police. An answer and the tracking is on. Then, Mabel slams the door just as someone is coming. We discover that it is his mother who jumps to the conclusion that the thieves are in there! So, while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, her mother and father try to make their way! This was perhaps the funniest part of the short together with some police car explosions. It's been 7 minutes so fast it's over before they start. The only real characterization developed is that of Mabel who exudes charm with her big face and eyes and looks so optimistically cheerful here except, of course, when she is scared. It's easy to see why she became a star. It is above all thanks to her that I have recommended to see him at least once and because I am giving a 4.
