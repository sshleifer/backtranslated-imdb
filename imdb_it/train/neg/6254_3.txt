A friend of mine was in the cast as an agent of the FEDS (a non-speaking part, as a souvenir). He brought it on DVD to see it. It was "interesting", but very felt like an amateur film. An amateur film well done, though. Really boring and badly written. It was probably fun and involved, but it certainly didn't deserve any kind of release. Maybe in Omaha they would have fun, but this California girl was bored and honestly a little embarrassed by my friend's involvement. <br /> <br /> If this director has made or produced other films, he should really try to have a really interesting storyline, and good actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them. I wish them good luck in the future and I hope they can improve their film production.
