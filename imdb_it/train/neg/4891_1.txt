I want to make some things clear. I am not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai films and I am very familiar with art cinema; I grew up in the seventies of Goddard, Fellini, Bergman, Bertolucci and many others. <br /> <br /> Art films then were really ART; like paints People did it to express their inner feelings, not worried if other people understand something. They were beyond commercial values; just look at old Antonioni (or the first Picasso) and you'll understand. <br /> <br /> Tian bian yi duo yun (The Wayward Cloud) has nothing to do with this. It is an opportunistic film, destined to deceive judges and critics of the festival, to play many things without saying anything. <br /> <br /> The plot makes no sense. The lack of water causes the government to promote the use of watermelons to hydrate itself. A desperate girl steals water from public toilets. There is also a porn star (near) that tries to make a movie with an actress that doesn't seem to feel comfortable. There is a romantic awakening between the girl and the porn star. The mess ends with a sexual scene (not pornographic) to which many people feel shocked, but I think it is less provocative than what can be seen in American Pie or History of Violence. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists have never been talking. Sometimes, a musical style number 60 appears and explains (through a song) what is happening in the minds of the characters. These video clips are really welcome because the previous scene, without dialogue or music, only the people who look at each other, sometimes requires 4, 5 or even more minutes than in the times of the movies is TOO. <br /> <br /> There are also some rumors about "the difficult sex without love", the "selfish mind of the porn industry". <br /> <br /> It is obvious, this film has the purpose (to get away with it) to deceive the juries and critics of the festival. It has some pseudo-shocking scenes (within the limits of Taiwanese censorship) and many topics are open, but nothing is concluded or going anywhere. <br /> <br /> These tricks have allowed the film some (disputed) important prices at film festivals and get the film an undeserved commercial success (I see the film in France and the theater was packed). <br /> <br /> However, please don't be fooled. There is nothing new or original or even originally told or filmed in this film. It's boring and empty; really a fraud to the public. Boogie Nights (which I didn't like very much), Intimacy and 9 Songs are far better films.
