First To Die 2003 <br /> <br /> I first admit my mistake: I didn't realize it was a TV movie. I was "thrown away" by the "R" certification. The plot is strong, but the film lasts about 40 minutes. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The downside of the film is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are violent scenes, no violence should require an "R" rating. There are no nude scenes or free sex scenes. In reality, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests of the SG-1 series, but this film did nothing to advance her career as they were all used as low-level actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as usual, and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day, Lee Marvin. The talented Megan Gallagher, who I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, was not given anything difficult to show his range of skills. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. In addition to being an below average and not particularly attractive actress, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself mumbling the TV during his dialogue. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates the type of Lifetime TV programs. I would not recommend paying to watch this movie. Considering that I didn't find anything that could cause censorship, this is a film that deserves to be seen only on TV, since nothing will be cut off. As a TV movie I would rate it as a 5 out of 10. As a film with an "R" certification and such a strong cast, I consider it a 2 out of ten.
