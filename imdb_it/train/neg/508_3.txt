First film directed by D.W. Griffith; presents a gloriously happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the minstrel of the building (Henry B. Walthall). When the king discovers the lovers, he decides to stage a horrible revenge-type Edgar Allen Poe. It is hard to believe that lovers cannot hear those who plot against them; even if the actors try to appear alternately noisy (the lovers) and silent (the concrete mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" very scenic. The performances are ok, and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
