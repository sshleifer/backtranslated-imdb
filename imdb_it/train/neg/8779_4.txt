As a fan of the White Noise cinema it was a total disappointment, as a director the cinematography was quite good, well lit, a good photographic work, a reasonable direction. But as a film it has just been imagined as predictable of all the other so-called horror films that the market has been flooded recently. Even though it had a bit of a "cold factor", the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) didn't seem credible. This film did not explain the reasoning for some events but brought them forward. The acting was anything but the mind that blew the main character without emotion, like many recent thriller / horror movies. <br /> <br /> Surely it is not a film that I will buy on DVD and I would not recommend anyone to run out to see it.
