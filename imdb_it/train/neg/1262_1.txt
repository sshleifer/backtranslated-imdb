This film has a weak plot, a weak characterization and really weak special effects that I wonder why I lost my precious life watching it. He has random characters that add nothing to the story and seem like excuses for the director to have his girlfriend in the film. The robots are sad and the main "hero" robot is lit by a huge knife switch. If this movie wasn't that bad, it would be ridiculous, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the few saving characters and is killed. It's sad when you're rooting for the bad guy, because he's the best to cheer on. When all was said and done, this film was best left on the cutting room floor, or never funded at all.
