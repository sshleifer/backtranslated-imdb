It is so sad that the Romanian public is still populated by vulgar and ignorant individuals who appreciate this kind of cheap and demonstrative, superficial and brutal shows like the "Garcea" series or the "Vacanta mare" games ... The difference is that Mugur Mihäescu, Doru Octavian Dumitru and other sub-artisans never claim to claim their shows as "art". Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a great film ("Duminicä la ora sase") followed by another, quite nice ("Reconstituirea"), tries to declare his "works of art", but unfortunately, he mastered a the cinematographic expressive means are too limited. As such, "Niki Ardelean" offers again an example of "HOW NOT" - this is due to its unique merit.
