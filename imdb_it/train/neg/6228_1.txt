This film is incomprehensibly bad. Start with several random explosions and then cut to a puppet of a T-Rex that talks (!) To the public. He goes back and forth between the puppet and the sock animation, probably because the directors could not afford live actors. I save you the long, tiring and relentless plot that drags this pitiful film for 85 brutal minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby shop somewhere that sells out b-movies, and bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it, but, apparently, our intervention was not necessary. This movie is self-made better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 of Outer Space" was the most exhilarating movie in existence, but we leave it at Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock puppets to overcome it. If you see this film anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
