I have to say that I'm a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films. <br /> <br /> Then you have this POS. I can't logically think that he made any effort like this with Cigarette Burns. At least his son made a decent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> You have to consider this from the point of view that it didn't look like a movie. It seemed that someone else had directed it for one thing. I don't think Carpenter made any effort in this. <br /> <br /> I was just listening to his old H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was great, especially for the times. > <br /> He used a style that nobody had and worked so well for his films.
