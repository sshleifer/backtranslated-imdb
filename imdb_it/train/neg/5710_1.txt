Well, on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer collaborated again, this time on a mix of robbery films, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But darling, this is for Indiana Jones what Speed ​​2 is for Speed. A reasonable cast (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a childish script and loses a lot. The film is little more than an extended advertisement for Masons. However, these Masons are not the usual traders who use strange handshakes and play golf, these Masons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions "From the Hell" or Jack the Ripper.) I don't think I revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is virtually no suspense, no surprise and no climax: it stops. National Treasure aims at Dan Brown but strikes the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo without humor.
