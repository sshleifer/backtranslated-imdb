There is nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you away from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The acting is terrible, the script is terrible; and the overrated special effects. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat the public with so much contempt? And why did they make a sequel?
