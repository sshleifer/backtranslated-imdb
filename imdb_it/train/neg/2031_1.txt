While William Shater always manages to make me smile in whatever appears, (and in particular I love him like Denny Crane in Boston Legal), well, this show is about pomp and dancers and screams and jumps up and down. > <br /> It does not have the intelligence of Millionaire, none of the appearance of Deal or No Deal. <br /> <br /> This show is about dances and stupid things to fill over time. > <br /> I watched it of course only to verify it. I watched it for over 45 minutes, then I had to turn it off. <br /> <br /> The best part was William Shatner's dance on stage. He is a hoot !!! unfortunately, this show WILL NOT DO IT. <br /> <br /> This is a fact
