DEATHSTALKER is perfect for fans of fantasy B movies; this film-making disguise of just 80 minutes offers all the hecklers can ask for: the non-existent plot, the terrible acting (except for at least a hoarse old lady), the ridiculous script and montage, and the style background deal settings. There are no characters that look funny or interesting (in particular, the protagonist has nothing interesting about him), and the actors barely do anything to get on top of the grade F material. If that's not enough, then what about the lack of a compelling storyline (that this film has nothing like that) to make DEATHSTALKER qualified as a big turkey? I was also offended that the women in this film barely have any purpose other than 1) being topless and / or poorly dressed; 2) is raped; 3) having sex with the hero; 4) all of the above. Furthermore, the background music is horrible; a bizarre confusion of electronic noise, choral explosions of cheese and orchestral cacophony at full volume. The numbness of the ear and numbness of the eye all in one breath have nothing to do to keep an interested person, DEATHSTALKER is probably the most suitable for people looking for something to laugh about (and believe me, here there is plenty of it). Otherwise, I don't recommend this 100th grade CONAN to anyone.
