If you expect to see a lot in the Altıoklar bathroom, as promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the film is none other than Altıoklar's populist style regarding the most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. For a lot of nudity, which seems to appear out of nowhere and has no connection with the plot, it shows that Altıoklar did not try in vain to "try something new" as he claimed. For many jokes based on sex it seems to show that Altıoklar had fallen for the famous saying that "sells sex". I was hoping to see a good story told with a very good narrative technique. However in the end I found myself sitting for 90 minutes and looking at Altıoklar's experiments, but still very focused on the dissemination work.
