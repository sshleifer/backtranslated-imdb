Dieter Bohlen, well-known German composer and producer of slightly shabby pop hits like "You're my heart, you're my soul" felt the need to tell his story - and politely decided to hire a ghost writer. The result was a fun book about his life. Well, more or less a blurred image of it. He did not deny that he was a selfish asshole, but the whole story was distorted to fit his image of himself. No word that probably beat his ex-wife and she ended up in the hospital. However it was written in a fun style and a huge success after his appearance as a jury member of the German version of "American Idol" - in particular his unforgettable comments. <br /> <br /> This should be the end of the story - really. In the advertising campaign of the aforementioned "Idol" TV show titled "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS), someone must have come up with the terrible idea of ​​making a movie outside the book. The result is "Dieter - der Film" <br /> <br /> I have rarely seen a film that desperately tries to be funny and fails completely. None of the gags really hit the point. Naddel's voice and style of talking were getting on my nerves, even though Verona's voice should have done more. Clear, childish, predictable and long gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie until the end in minutes. The content of the film is a sloppy adaptation of the film spelled by a phantom writer based on Bohlen's unfair idealized memory. They could have used this freedom to do almost everything. It had to be a satire, but they failed. The story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is Bohlen himself guarantees that the whole film has nothing satirical. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder that it was considered bad for a film version. The probability that this thing was rotted in some archive was quite high until recently, when the current DSDS season turned out to be a mediocre success. With the "friendly" help of the biggest German press newspaper "BILD" and the desperate situation for the RTL television station to have something in the program while the still unbeatable show "Wetten dass ...?" filming on Channel 2 the film has finally arrived on television - unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a waste of time - there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story that is really worth watching. /> <br /> Therefore: 2/10
