I bought this (it was only $ 3, ok?) Under the title "Gray Matter". The novelty of seeing Sherriff Roscoe in a non-DukesOfHazzard role intrigued me. As other reviewers have warned, it's a rather boring story of a top secret government experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> And yes, there are many shots, especially of a house with a pool in front. Some of the characters and interiors are so anonymous that I imagine that the filmmakers feared that we might forget who is who, so they continue to tip us by showing us outside the buildings first. It's actually pretty funny. After a while the shot in the pool looks like a logo identifying the station of a television channel, reminding us that we are looking at "Materia grigio". <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed two nickname periods. At one point an angry subject tries to make fun of someone who calls her "Scientific b * tch!". It's just a very inadequate insult. Several scenes later another subject escapes by muttering about the "scientific b ** tard!" It seemed really embarrassing to me. <br /> <br /> One day this movie will disappear forever. For some decades now it will probably be impossible to find copies of it. Almost as if it never happened. <br /> <br />
