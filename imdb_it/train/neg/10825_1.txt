What made the idea of ​​seeing this film so attractive was the hope that it could live up to the brilliance of Charlotte Bronte in the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find that this film, which seemed to be written or filmed in great haste, did not have the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be missing from the script or left on the floor of the editing room. The charismatic sense of self of Jane Eyre, which allowed her to suffer through her tumult and triumph over everything, was also missing. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this film doesn't seem to have much to triumph, including one of the biggest parts of the story when Jane escapes from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. His struggle to find food and shelter, his shame of having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man he loved were, in my opinion, moving parts of history that were simply left out of this film. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unpleasant and for those who have not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be the least interesting. The script and the director have given little or no credit to classical history.
