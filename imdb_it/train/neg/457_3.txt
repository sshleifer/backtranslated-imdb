Of course, I like cartoons, but I didn't like that. Of course, children would love it. But then again, I'm not a kid anymore (although I still consider myself young). <br /> <br /> I will not tell you anything about the story, for the simple reason that there is no story. How is it possible that this cartoon dragon was nominated for an Oscar ?! Well ... I think it's because people in the 1930s were happier than not much now. In the present we live in, everything must happen quickly. Watch movies today, and you will come to the same conclusion: we live in a society that does not allow men to be slow. It's really a pity. I wish I lived in the 1930s, because it seems so peaceful. But each time it has its ups and downs, I guess ... <br /> <br /> To conclude: if you like music (and frogs), you'll have to see this cartoon. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it.
