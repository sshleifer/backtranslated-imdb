It seems that this film was made by someone with some good ideas, but he had never made a film before, nor had he thought that a script should be modified or even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw it for John Candy and I assumed, wrongly, that it would be hilarious. Instead, there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat, non-fun moments. And, to complete the work, Candy delivered some of the rawest lines I had ever heard before. So, despite a potentially funny cast and story idea, there remains an amateur and raw movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult, even if the kids will probably find some laugh. It's really a pity - it could have been a lot better. I mean, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy it SHOULD have been wonderful.
