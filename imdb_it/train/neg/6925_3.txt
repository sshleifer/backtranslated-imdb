I feel a lot less generous with this film than others of its kind. The portrait of fools in this century is always made with them to be so totally bizarre as to be a different species. Their antics are so outrageous that they are totally fictional. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or have a charm for chickens. They are doing or beating each other. It is as if the screenwriter said, what can I consider him to do, without knowing what madness or even mental illness is. Look at the wonderful human portrait in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", where diseases are credible and real. I once worked in a state psychiatric hospital. I didn't see any of these guys. These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.
