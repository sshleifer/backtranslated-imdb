As someone who has read the novel and seen the film, I have a different view of why the film was such a flop. First of all, any comparison between novel and film is purely superficial. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably intended as a satire, but instead comes as a cross between tragedy and controversy. Any comic element such as those that later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are simply accessories to the author's uniform cynical thrust. And for fear that the author's omnipresent white dress deceived you into thinking that this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more suitable literary precedent would be the spectrum of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and a cross. Tom Wolfe is an equal part clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new hands for his self-absorbed mill. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising therefore that the excellent production skills and profuse direction in the making of the film have been condemned from the beginning. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, the controversies are based not on universally accessible observations on some form or other human behavior, but on a resolute attack on specific people - real or fictitious haystacks - who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. Any attempt to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free from the writer's influence or interference. <br /> <br /> That said, I also found a defect in the casting. It's not just that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure themselves, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman are totally wasted or have roles that are mere caricatures. <br /> <br /> Here there is enough current material for a real film satire, but it cannot even get close.
