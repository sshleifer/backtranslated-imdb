I tried watching this movie in a military camp during a mission abroad, and let me tell you, you'll see something in those circumstances. It's not this piece of sh * t though. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes set the tone of a weak quality acting from porn movies, strange twists out of the blue and incredible situations and behavior. Later, it gets worse. This film does not have a single saving grace, yet it is not bad in a way that could make it fun to watch. It's just awful. I've seen a lot of movies in my life and I'm not one of those snobby critics who all know, I mean I will like most movies, even if they're bad. This man. <br /> <br /> I was out of here, my friend.
