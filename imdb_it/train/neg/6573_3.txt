I read the reviews for this and, although I didn't expect a private Ryan rescue, I expected a film of a certain substance. <br /> <br /> The film starts very lopsided with the usual introduction of the story and how the unit came into being. But immediately it's 1944 and you're not sure where everyone is. Accents, etc. They are very scarce as this unit should be Hawaiian / Asian American but all speak very poorly of English imitation of a Japanese at Harvard. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I couldn't see any more. The characters were three-dimensional and, although probably based on real people, I had no feelings for them and this left me without worrying about them. Very poor direction of a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channels. I would avoid and try better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story but it deserved a better story. You had the feeling that the director had seen a band of brothers and thought it was enough to sell his film. My advice, avoid and watch band of siblings, Tuskegee, Gloria or any other films like when the trumpets vanish ...
