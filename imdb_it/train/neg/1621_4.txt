'The Fox and the Child' is the new film by French director Luc Jacquet, who gave us the Oscar-winning documentary "March of the Penguins". He focuses on a girl (wonderfully played by Bertille Noël-Bruneau) and on her flourishing friendship with a fox. <br /> <br /> There are some really mesmerizing moments here; the badgers that bite, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-covered forest; a scene in particular when the fox is tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and sometimes frightening. However, there are simply not enough. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed; cinematography is dazzling. The type of sparkling appearance of the film is wonderful. It is undeniably a very lush production. <br /> <br /> The English version is narrated by Kate Winslet, but the little dialogue that is already there has been very little nicknamed. Even the score is too soft, or at least it's for my taste; and the screenplay, though subtle, seems to jump from one scenario to another, and in the end leaves me almost baffled. <br /> <br /> While there is a beautiful moral in the heart of the film, and the rather quiet performance of Noël-Bruneau is quite adorable, the real star is the fox. Those captivating moments that focus exclusively on our little furry friend are huge. However, again, there are almost not enough of them. <br /> <br /> - To keep up to date with all the latest films, including reviews, news, discussions and more, don't forget to visit www.mybluray. com.au
