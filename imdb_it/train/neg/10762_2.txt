This was an impulse to get me from the local video store. Don't make the same mistake I made. This film is boring, unconvincingly interpreted and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly badly written and delivered; I shivered in every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes some scattered appearances and is his usual disjointed self; his role was clearly not a trait for him. And although the film is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it looks much more like a Hollywood movie; all the main characters are Caucasians and many tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. However, when you see it on the shelf of your local video store, keep walking.
