I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize the movies, but my God !!! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad stuff! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers clich√©s on the way to a rave (which takes place in broad daylight) on a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers, the clan group sets off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are helped by a police officer and a sea captain who has the right number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and other survivors. Basically the rest of the film is a collection of mishandled action sequences that include a long shoot-out outside the "house of the dead". This fight came complete with violent Hollywood violence, redundant sequences of the HOTD video game and sloppy matrix camera rotations. One of the characters is even willing to sacrifice himself to save others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because a part of his face had been marked with acid, a zombie spit at him after continuing to beat the creature long after it was disabled! Should I feel sorry for this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To sum it all up, it makes absolutely no sense to see this movie unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh * t could easily have covered the costs of making it. GRADE: F
