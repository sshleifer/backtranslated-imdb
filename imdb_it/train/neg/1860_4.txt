Michael Keaton's 1998 comedy kiddie with the same title was condemned to death for its shoddy special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked for this horror comedy, they are truly stunning. The killer snowman looks like made of polystyrene and his arms look like oversized oven gloves. Which they probably were. The cast often puts him in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) films and Paul Keith as the city doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role.
