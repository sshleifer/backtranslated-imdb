This is not one of those reviews on special effects or poor or dated technology, topics that only the stupidest people could relate to, but rather a review of the story, of which most of us are really interested. <Br /> <br /> The plot is about a combination of members of the British and British Navies of the Second World War and two civilians (the hero and the heroine), who are united on a German boat and end up in a wild land of dinosaurs. /> <br /> Manipulations are not so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. Which films like this need credible and nice characters, along with some semblance of reason in actions. <br /> <br /> This film lacks both. For a full-length movie, only 6 characters are assigned at any time and 3 of them are barely examined. McClure's hero goes beyond the "routine", and it doesn't make much sense at any time. <br /> <br /> The female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle on the land of the dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not a big riddle, and we could care less. <br /> <br /> A lot of failures in a film that should have been better, even for its time.
