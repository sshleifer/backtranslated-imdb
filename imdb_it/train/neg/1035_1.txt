Horrible acting, horrible cast and cheap props. It would have been much better if it had been set up as a parody style action movie. What a waste. Starting from the name of the film. <br /> <br /> "The Enemy" entitled "Action Movie" would have made it better. (contributing to the parody effect). The policeman looks like a 60-year-old player, the blonde girl always has the same boring empty expression on her face at all times. Towards the end of the movie he and she are working together to take down the bad guys and every time they exchange words it looks just like the economic lines given before a sex scene in a porn movie. Horrible. Do not waste time.
