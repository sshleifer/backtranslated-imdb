My friends and I went to this movie without knowing what to expect, but hoping for the best. When we left, we were only slightly more informed about the plot of the film. Although it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely don't recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. Maybe a friend would rent it for you (it's not even worth the rent) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so complicated that you have no idea what will happen until in the last five minutes, there is really not much that can be said in its defense. The acting was decent, more than you expect to get from this movie, and some of the shots were good, but it was all bogged down in a crappy plot and a poor script. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as I came out, I went to buy a ticket to see a good movie just to purify myself. I advise everyone to skip the first step and go see a good movie.
