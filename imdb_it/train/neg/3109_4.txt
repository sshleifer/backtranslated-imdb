This film was not terrible, but it was not very nice. I'm a big fan Toni Collette I think she's a very beautiful and talented actress. The film starts from Robin Williams who is a writer and receives a book from a 14-year-old boy. The book is fantastic and cannot believe that it was written by a child. Toni Collette interprets the guardian of children who do not know if this child really exists or is inventing everything. I will not ruin the film, but I will say that the film is not scary. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite good and Toni Collette's performance was fantastic as was Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> The film was a huge disappointment, in my opinion, I would expect it to come on DVD.
