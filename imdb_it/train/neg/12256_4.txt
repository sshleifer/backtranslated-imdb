Oh God, I must have seen it when I was only 11 or 12, (don't ask me how) I could have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Some might see that this is a bad movie, ugly, vulgar, contemptible and very silly. I saw more impressive effects at Disneyland, I saw better performances at a school play, and I saw more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass. <br /> <br /> The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport by sailing in shark-filled waters. It soon becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning what, they receive the help of a middle-aged fisherman grizzly, who wants to kill the animal to avenge his family's food. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst of which is the sequel. Blood Surf should be the second worst crossover hit, I think, with Primeval and Crocodile closely following. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, with over a hundred injuries or deaths each year. Movies like Blood Surf, however, ruin not only the fierce image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the life of the viewer. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
