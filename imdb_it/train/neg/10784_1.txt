It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of a cast! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed TWICE in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. We don't even rent it. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was too cruel to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was OK. OK. I felt sorry for him (the actor) in case people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as always. Fascinating and sweet, but without purpose. The "romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
