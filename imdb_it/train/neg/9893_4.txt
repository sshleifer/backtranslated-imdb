I just hope no old classicist / historian saw "Cleopatra", or, if they did, they took it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, even more ridiculous than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulated and correspond well to the plot). The most brazen Octavius, the heir of Caesar, in the Senate before the assassination of Caesar: at the venerable age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition to this, acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says "Caesar, Julius Caesar". Billy Zane is a ridiculous fig Marc Marcy. And Leonor Varela does her best to be the seductive Pharaoh (who in real life was not at all beautiful) but turns out to be incredible. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning to all historians - this film is not true for life!
