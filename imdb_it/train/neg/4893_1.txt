The film is actually too slow. There are some beautiful images but it cannot overcome the fact that the film is actually boring. See sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may seem interesting to someone, but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Even if you laugh several times but it's not enough and it could be more for despair and unbelief than for fun. To disturb the boredom, the director tries to insert a few video clips into the film. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs from the 1950s, but it's hard to say exactly and they're trying to be so funny that it's really sad. Many times you have the feeling that the plot can evolve into something, that a powerful scene is created but in the end it just somehow just evaporates. Beside the clips there are practically no dialogues, not to mention music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally I can't recommend the film. I believe that art is something that should not be boring. During the screening there were yawns throughout the cinema that corroborate my brief review.
