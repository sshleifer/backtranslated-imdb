"It's not like that big mechanical toy", says a character at the beginning, commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would just like to have a beast as convincing as the shark in the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this film are TERRIBLE. Even acting and directing are not much better; they seem more suited to a deodorant or bubble-gum advertisement than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but also for the public. Saying that "you liked it" this film only encourages the directors to offer us more of this shit, further destroying the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
