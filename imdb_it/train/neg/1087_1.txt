This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. While presenting good actors, the film does not live up to expectations. The most dramatic thing about this film is the music, which sums up the film very well: to compensate for a bad and confusing plot with famous actors, strong and dramatic music. It doesn't change the fact, that this is a very boring movie to watch. He earned a score of 1.
