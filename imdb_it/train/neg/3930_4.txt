The Second Renaissance, part 1 shows how the machines rebelled against humans before. It all starts with a single case, in which machines claim to have the right to live, while humans claim that a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with what they want. <br /> <br /> Although an interesting premise, the story becomes really silly since then with (violent!) revolts between robots and humanity. Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer indicates, it's all a bit too clever. <br /> <br /> The animator stories that are near the core of the matrix (in particular Osiris) work for the best. As for the Second Part of the Renaissance 1, I would say that it is too violent and too silly. 4/10.
