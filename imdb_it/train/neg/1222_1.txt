This is a seriously disturbed film. Although the boys deserved a little of what they had ... the sadistic executions were "slightly" over the top. The only character who showed a certain conscience at the beginning of the hunt was killed before he could offer help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there seemed to be some promise of a mediocre deal, but this was just a ploy to lull the spectators into a false sense of security, before the joy of what would have happened. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the film for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and screamed, "and, where is the batman?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> Now it would have been nice!
