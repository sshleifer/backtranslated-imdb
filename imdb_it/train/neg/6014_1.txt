Left Behind is an incredible waste of over 17 million dollars. The acting is weak and uninteresting, the story is even weaker. The public is asked to believe in the wholly unlikely and often laughable plot line and gave nothing in exchange for their good faith. Not only is the film poorly interpreted and scripted, but it is seriously lacking in all the technical areas of cinema. Production design does nothing to help the credibility of the action. The effects are completely unoriginal and flat. Illumination and general continuity are inexcusably terrible; even compared to films with a tenth of the budget. However, none of this will matter in the sense that millions of families will undoubtedly embrace the film because of its healthiness and religious inclinations; and who can blame them. However, it is unfortunate that they will be forced to accept 3rd level film direction.
