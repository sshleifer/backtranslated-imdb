The parody of horror is not just a thing of the 21st century. Long before the "Scary Movie" series, there were some examples of this genre, mostly in the 1980s. But as the franchise said, most of these films are inconstant. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above this, but others like "Saturday 14" and the sequel fails to provide laughter. But among all these types of films there is a particularly big crime and this is 'Transylvania 6-5000', a big waste of time for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Pros: An exceptional cast that does its best. A bit of stupid humor is fun. A song with a banal theme, but capture. Some good locations in Transylvania. <br /> <br /> Cons: flat texture. Mostly boring rhythm. Most humor doesn't cut it. Monsters are given little to do and little screen time. Did I think this should have been a parody of monster movies? Lame ending that will probably make viewers angry. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: is this a comedy? If so, why are the really fun bits so few and far? Comedies should make us roll on the floor, not rolling our eyes and yawning, aching for it to end. I can't believe that Anchor Bay released this tired garbage. I admit it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money, even if you're a fan of all the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
