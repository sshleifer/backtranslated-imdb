It's a good thing I haven't seen him while I was pregnant. I would surely have cried my eyes and / or vomited. It was a bit creepy, mostly disturbing. Personally, I thought the child was adorable in his little twisted way. However, as a mother, I collapsed when Beth stabbed me in the stomach and when Virgina aborted the baby during her third trimester with no less rusty tools. Also, as an animal lover I almost cried when he scratched the cat with a bloody pulp. However, as disturbing and sinister as the child was, I was rooting for a living. And though the film was intriguing, I am extremely intrigued by seeing the sequel ...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... ... ..
