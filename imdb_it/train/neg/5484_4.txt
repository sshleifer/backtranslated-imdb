This film is about a family trying to come to terms with the death of their mother / wife by moving to Genoa, Italy. <br /> <br /> The "Genoa" plot looks promising, but unfortunately it is empty and without focus. The film consists only of a collection of scenes that describe the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons or cooking eggs. Many of these scenes are redundant and boring, they cannot emotionally engage viewers. The finish is very disappointing as it is not spectacular, moving or emotional. I can safely say that I am disappointed and bored by "Genova" The only positive thing about the film is the sunny weather and the beauty of Genoa. "Genova" can be a tourist advertisement extended for the city, but not like a movie to be enjoyed.
