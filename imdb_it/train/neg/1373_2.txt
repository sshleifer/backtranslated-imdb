This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Usually I praise any film for some aspects of its production, but the intensely irritating behavior of over half of the characters made it difficult for me to appreciate any part of this film. <br /> <br /> The most common was the inference that the guy who designed the building was at fault an avalanche that was ruining it. All right. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, trying to ski an avalanche slalom style will not work. Running 10 feet on some trees will not work. Alas he does here. As mentioned before the innate dumbness and the pure stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In an enclosed space with limited oxygen, a four-year-old could say that starting a fire is not a good idea. <br /> <br /> However, about 5 minutes of the film redeems itself and acquires a certain appreciation. However, if you have a minimum of intelligence, you too will find most of this film difficult to tolerate. <br /> <br /> It hurts that so many quality stories are not produced yet someone will pay for things like this. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Well, to give you a hook you have to keep looking to see the latest avalanche fighting techniques. Absolutely priceless.
