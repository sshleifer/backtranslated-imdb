while watching this movie I got sick. I grew up with Pippi and every time it was a real pleasure. when my wife came to Sweden, she was watching the old people and had a real laugh. but this American version should be renamed and never shown again. it's terrible from start to finish. how can they manage to do it wrong? Well I guess someone accuses the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi. this film has never been seen and never broadcast. burn the movie and save the children. if you want to watch Pippi watch the original movie and have a good laugh. WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON, sorry Tami Erin, you can never resist Pippi .. Oh yes ... when you read the "spoilers" explanation, it "ruins" a surprise and rob the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the movie. "Well, I guess the director lives up to this ... you're watching this movie at your own risk ... it's really a waste of time ...
