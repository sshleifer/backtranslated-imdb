<br /> <br /> Why this film has got a 6-star average is beyond me. The script is so trivial and frankly an insult to those who based the life on which it is based. Cinematography comes directly from the world of advertising, and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed. However Demi Moore shows no surprise by participating in this film, if you look at its tracklist. All in all, a "high concept" style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of.
