Does Shonda Rhimes' brilliant team seem to have outsourced the writing of this somewhere offshore, perhaps to the MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, promising at first, but predictable within 1 season by David Kelly Flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so extravagant, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what makes medical dramas really good - dramatic situations you're afraid of, "this could be me." They are not even funny. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the plots are dead and can't be brought back to life. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you: Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, immoral and inexperienced therapist. Anyone who writes his things has rejected ethics and transference / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give him a code of ethics to read (the episode with his wife bleeding his nose and involving the therapist in it). No therapist is so bad. <br /> <br /> Women who want the men who went ahead - they were killed, we all graduated in "Sex and the City". Addison in her youthful aggression towards the boy she likes - very inadequate to age, seems so unnatural about a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it and doesn't deliver it very well. The only successful / pleasing developments are Addison struggling with his decision to move to Los Angeles, and the "Voodoo Dr" and his way of dealing with widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept could work with a completely new writing team.
