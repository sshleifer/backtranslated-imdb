I love sharks. And the mutants. And the explosions. In theory, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best film ever. <br /> <br /> It is not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a Power Rangers villain, and has roughly the same range of rubbery movement. This could be fine if the producers were not as proud of their design as they seem. That is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action / scifi / horror movie that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of time on the screen. Of course, it is usually shaky and irregular. I guess you should assume it's so scary that even the camera guy goes crazy. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person who is going to be eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera returns to the person being eaten, only now they are screaming and without arms. And so on. <br /> <br /> The costume is bad, the acting is poor and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. Things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or something can explode. Because let me tell you, the people who made this film definitely came up with other explosions = more better minded. The characters shoot at the cars and there's a massive explosion. Shoot helicopters, there's a massive explosion. Barrels, rocks, trees, ALMOST, they all explode, so that the scary shark explodes at the end. <br /> <br /> By the way, I don't care how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe that anyone can think of trying to make half a shark half a person have sex with a woman to make the strange shark that kids are a good idea. I mean, UNLESS that person is the mad scientist in this movie. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its wickedness is not enough to contain a person's prolonged interest. It might be a good idea for MST3K with your friends, but beyond that, if you happen to catch this bad guy, do yourself a favor and change channels.
