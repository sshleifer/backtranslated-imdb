I've heard many stories about this movie being great ... Well, I took the opportunity when I saw it for a cheap price on Ebay last month. <br /> <br /> I looked at it, and I have only a few comments about it: <br /> <br /> 1) Terrible plot, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad fighting scenes ... <br /> <br /> I've never seen any worse films in my life away !! When the plot is bad, at least make the fights something more interesting. But BOTH are made ridiculously ... <br /> <br /> * The only good thing about this film (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she's pretty in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's it ...
