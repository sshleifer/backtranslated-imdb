I don't usually say it's not worth watching a movie, but this is certainly a mitigating circumstance. The only real positive side of this film is Cornelia Sharpe, which looks quite attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is incredibly boring and does not go anywhere for the whole movie. None of the characters is even remotely interesting and there is no reason to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to make this film, but he would certainly have to pass this. <br /> <br /> The only reason I see this movie is if you are a dead-hard Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he did. Save this last though. <br /> <br /> Well, if by some miracle you end up seeing this despite my review (or any other review on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
