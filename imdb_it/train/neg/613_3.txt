Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a lousy piece of shit. I am surprised that it was rated as high as it did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: what's NOT wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just crap and clich√©. Here is what it is ... Some nerdy kid with no friends is made fun of, he is killed and returns as a scarecrow for revenge. "Everything" is enclosed in 86 minutes of worthless film. If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time watching it. Also, the second one is not much better, so don't worry about watching or ... I voted for this threesome because I liked the scarecrow's clothing, not because there was something good in the film. I think you have the photo.
