I have a suggestion for the people who made this film, if you're going to make a movie like this make sure you have the f / x to back it up. Also, don't play with a group of actors on the z list. Another thing, almost all of us have seen Jurassic Park, so don't copy it blatantly. All in all this film was sucked, f / x sucked, recited sucked, history not original. Let's talk about acting for a second, the boy Carradine who reached the climax in 1984 when he made "The revenge of the nerds" (which was actually a great comedy). It is not exactly a z list, it can act. He just had to say no to this s - t bag. He should have done what Mark Hamill did after "Return of the Jedi" and go quietly into the night. He left his mark as a "nerd" and should have been like that. I understand that he has the bills to pay, but this almost never justifies this s - t bag. Have I already called this movie? OK. I just wanted to be sure. If I look a bit hostile, I apologize. I just wasted 2 hours of my life that I could have spent doing something productive like looking at peel paint, and I feel cheated. I close on that note. Thank you for your time.
