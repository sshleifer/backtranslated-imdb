Another weak voice of the third season, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' however it has at least one fundamental element of the plot that is very different and, as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who has to be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans to madness. Too bad the episode is not up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to "never" show the alien, given that his true face does not even come close to such a discouraging accumulation; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic luminous screen used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is going through a magnetic storm or something similar. However, the appearance of Kollos can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and only if Spock wears a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos', which I found funny, but I digress.) At one point Spock is forced to merge the mind with Kollos so the alien can to pilot the Enterprise to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock / Kollos returns to put an end to the mental fusion, first, Spock forgets his visor. Uh Oh. He becomes crazy but eventually he recovers with the help of Kollos's assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This may have been a truly bizarre episode, excellent but it is misguided and still looks like another poorly executed show of the series' last season.
