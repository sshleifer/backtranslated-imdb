I knew nothing about this film before being convinced to see it from a friend who had heard that it was an "epic non-stop battle scene from beginning to end". This could not have been further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateur films, horribly performed that I have ever had the misfortune to set eyes on. I would classify it with the film that I consider the worst film of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it's hard to believe that the creators of this movie thought that this soap opera crap would be taken seriously as a real historical fact. It also features some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells the girl "You smell the moon." The girl replies "What does the moon smell like?" OMG! You are making a fool of me! The scene where the boy was drawn and quartered got good laughter from the audience, since it seemed so ridiculously cheap and the FX sound of the boy being ripped up reminded me that someone made a farting sound with his mouth. If you're playing in a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so ugly that I actually made the decision about 45 minutes through which I had to catch up on sleep ... and I did it. Terrible.
