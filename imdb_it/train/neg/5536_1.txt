The zombie revolt has no salvific characteristics. I'm tired of people who say it's not so bad, and that the effects should have been more crazy in 1936. I suspect it's not true: it's not that the IQs have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. The average observer in 1936 was probably bored by this garbage as the average viewer of today. Why? Just try to watch the first few scenes and count the pauses between the things that happen, the horrible choice of when to cut in the foreground, slapdash editing that seems to include two extra seconds on each shot to compensate for the execution time. Pay attention to the completely redundant dialogue: "I'm about to make tea / go out and read my book now". "You are?" "Yes I am." That type of exchange happens several times. Normally I would really like to be a big fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumble their trivial and boring lines, and all the desires to laugh at the film slowly fade away. This kind of disinterested and disastrous breakthrough of time is far worse than energetic, imaginative thought spirits like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than those more interesting films have a backward idea of ​​entertainment. This film is not bad in the sense that your jaw remains open in amazement: it is ugly in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom. Which is much worse
