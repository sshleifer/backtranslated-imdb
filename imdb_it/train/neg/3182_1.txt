Final Justice has the great Joe Don Baker running in Texas, shooting people who shoot at people. Then he leaves for Malta where he shoots more people. He is locked up many times for shooting people. Then he enters a firefight with the villain, who is dressed like a monk. There is a boat chase, and Joe Don ends up in jail again. Finally Joe Don, with the help of Elaine of "Seinfeld", kills the villain, blows up a boat or two and someone is hit with a flare. All this is a catchy theme song, just like Mitchell!
