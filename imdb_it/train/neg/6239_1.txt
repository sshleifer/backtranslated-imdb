Where was your criticism of democratic and republican administrations? After all, he served for more than 17 years in a governing body in which his influence was indifferent. Oh, I forgot the 8 years he was the 2nd commander of the most powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show the blows of a young Senator Gore who asks why a NASA scientist was forced to modify a conclusion in his scientific article, but he cannot ask for Clinton / Gore's complicity in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would have damaged Hillary's chances in 2008. In any case, he is a coward politician and a party man to the end. It offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way of being the history of industrial development that brought us to this point in time <br /> <br /> In the end this film spoke much more than Mr. Gore itself rather than the real problems our environment faces. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a movie for the campaign, shorten and call what it really is.
