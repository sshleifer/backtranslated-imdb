The character of Demi Moore in the film was selected for the SEALs because of his appearance. It was a bad start and the movie went down from there. The plot was absolutely incredible. The willingness to do it in a tough military unit is not enough. This film has not convinced me of a woman's physical ability to perform the types of tasks required. <br /> <br /> Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same thing is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between the sexes are what make life interesting.
