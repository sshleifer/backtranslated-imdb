This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have an appetite for terrible (and good) films. He could (only) have managed a kind of teenage humor if he was constantly ironic - the ROKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really very funny. Other films, like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, manage to be funny while (apparently) trying to be serious. As for acting, they seem to have gathered mindless teenagers and asked them to advertise the entire production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was a decent interpretation: that of the older ghoul making his way on the motorcycle.
