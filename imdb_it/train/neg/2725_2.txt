The friendly gringo Telly Savalas (in the role of Frank Cooper) is an American-Mexican "Border Cop". It serves as a father figure for the young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be the witness of his imminent marriage. Savalas is tough, but chief Eddie Albert (as commander Moffat) could be tougher. Difficult is what you need to stop the smuggler Michele V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez). Alliances can be in flow. <br /> <br /> If you find the opportunity to listen to "Kojak" and "Oliver Douglas" by uttering the expletives to be repellent, you should avoid "The Border". Otherwise, you may not have the stomach for the "realistic" slaughtering scene of the cows. Even if it doesn't end up being worth a lot, Mr. De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** The Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
