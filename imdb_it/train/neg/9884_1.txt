I was a fan of Without A Trace from the main episode. I can't really express my disappointment in last week's episode. This is a real problem that too many African American families have faced and continue to manage. The lack of crucial media coverage in the first 48 hours was documented by a recent study. Law enforcement agencies, including local, state and federal, are also complicit. What was the purpose of advertising this topic and then ending up at the end? Apparently, television can handle almost ALL the topics EXCEPT GARA. This is shameful. Go ahead together or don't explore it next time.
