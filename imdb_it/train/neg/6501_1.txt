This film is once again, one of those films that someone thinks or tries to make others believe they understood. Anyone trying to make sense of this is a MORON! My advice is to take TWO not one but TWO strong acid shots and at least you will have a visual thrill! Even if you could eventually kill yourself for wasting your acid !!!! Since this comment requires 10 lines of information, let me write something for those of you who will try to defend the film. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Talent waste. The film is ice, with the paper in destination with clouds ringing, in a sunny immersion in the pudding .... It looks like a lion in a red light with hair in sight. Now explain it to me !!!!
