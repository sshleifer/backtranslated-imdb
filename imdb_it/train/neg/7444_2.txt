Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this film is the most fun. Actually, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight the urge to leave the theater. I would like to have. A waste of a perfectly nice Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Even "Silent Hill" was scarier. Hell, even "Pan's Labyrinth" was scarier. I'm still not clear on what should have been scary in this movie. <br /> <br /> To begin with, I am very wary of films that use "pidgin russian" like this in the opening credits. It's embarrassing for me since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all fell. OMG. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you too) this film has already slipped my mind and I just came out an hour ago. So I don't have specifics, just obscure images that go nowhere and a languishing-now-dead hope that anything could happen. <br /> <br /> Maybe I saw a completely mutilated version of this film because I can't believe it got great reviews here (and that's why I saw it) and I ended up being so completely devoid of Horror or Suspense but also of Overall Entertainment Value. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep and wanted to leave after 40 minutes, but I woke up and didn't leave.
