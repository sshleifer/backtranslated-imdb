Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel on a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He is also a highly qualified surgeon and roams freely around Kabul, working on injured NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he randomly takes a sniper rifle and shoots Osama bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is eventually promoted to a sergeant, but is unable to decide between a career as a sniper and a surgeon, so he resigns from the army. A year later, frustrated by civil life, he joined the Navy and the last scene proudly shows him wearing a white uniform.
