This adaptation positively slaughtered a classic that is loved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​the different nuances of the Rochester character. I have the feeling that he never even read the book, just jumped on the set with his straps too tight and he was given a summary of the characters he read "Grumpy, ugly, dark past". He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person, but as a grumbler who never smiles until he gets engaged and in that moment miraculously turns into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited me was the disbelief and also the sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is definitely turning in the grave. GO AND RENEW THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. AND FOR THE WAY: A "PASSIONATA" LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU MUST EAT HIS FACE.
