I imagined that any horror movie with Orson Welles would be strange. Necromancy was safe but a little strange for his sake. The film really has a disturbing feeling as it is a coven of satanists / witches in a small town and an attempt by a young woman to escape them. It seems that the director is deliberately trying to confuse the audience using flashbacks and dream sequences. From the finale, there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse, since the plot is so confusing, it's pretty hard to cheer on any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles agrees to play this film mainly because he doesn't have much to do. Maybe one day they will release a tape of the outtakes and bloopers of this movie. Now it would be really fun!
