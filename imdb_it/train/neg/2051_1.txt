Since there is nothing wrong with acting, etc. Etc., The writing for the episode is far away for this phantom series or without ghost. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the Martian man hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the sixth series, no matter what happens, it is not true what is happening and in reality it does not bring anything to the history of the series except to meet again the Martian hunter and to waste 30 minutes to do it is by far another case of bad writing in Smallville's soap opera. I really like the show, but mainly because of the cast and the 3 or more good episodes every year, but whoever is on the cast who writes or works to work on soaps needs to be boxed. This was by far the worst. With in the first 4 minutes you know what is happening is false and whatever happens is a dream based on Clark's inflation, obviously caused by a ghost character from the area and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't really create a villain who will progress the plot every week. He may also have added another villain to die in the last episode in which the Martian man hunter was present and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to take a look more closely in this episode and call it a day.
