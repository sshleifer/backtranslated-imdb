It doesn't even deserve a review, except as a warning to potential viewers. It's a ghost story somehow generic about an actress who haunts a studio during the filming of a vintage WWII drama. There is no fear, no suspense or surprises. A shocking moment that seems a bit too silly to be shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, even if there is a bit of editing every now and then. The story never comes together, and the film is really just a failure. 4/10.
