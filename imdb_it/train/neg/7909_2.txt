Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> this movie gets a 7 out 0f 10. This must be one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, the plot (so to speak) was just as bad. Offcourse everyone knows what will happen in the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you manage to fascinate the audience during the initial phase up to that point. But this is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the two main actors. Unfortunately it was a waste of time, and certainly a waste of money. <br /> <br /> and the 2 of only to try
