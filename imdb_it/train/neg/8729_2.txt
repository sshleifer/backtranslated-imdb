This is a thriller with a good concept, good acting, good photography and good intentions all around, but one that is confused and disjointed in execution. <br /> <br /> Garcia plays John Berlin, a Los Angeles-based forensic investigator who moved to a small California town at the behest of a friend on strength there. Soon he gets involved in the investigation of an unsolved murder leading to his theory of the existence of a serial killer whom no one else believes. The known victim is theorized to be blind, leading to a love affair with a blind girl - she believed to be a witness - in a nearby school for the blind. <br /> <br /> Despite a fundamentally intriguing story, there were too many jumps and plot holes in this movie where I found myself wondering, 'how the hell did we end up here? or "how did we find out?" I found it confused and disjointed, despite good acting, etc. John Malkovich has a small part towards the end as a F.B.I. investigator for Berlin. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
