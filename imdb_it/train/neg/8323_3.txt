From the beginning this film has had some flaws. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a young rich tycoon who inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and is struggling to fill his father's shoes and cut the ropes of the mother (and co-leader) apron too tight. He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo which is the register of organ donors. There are also minor minor stories that your first instinct is mostly to ignore that become important later, like his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba ). Lines of non-creative stories, but not bad enough to ruin the film. The only real "oy vey!" moment was the name of the character of Lena Olin. A bully woman named Lilith ... slim! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not at all censored. I appreciate the fact that people who find scary surgery scenes may not be. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well in the beginning. Observe an emotional agony while Christensen screams inwardly through the incision of the chest and the rib. The irony moment of the trailers comes when he is one of the few unlucky to be awake during anesthesia, but he is also lucky because it helps him to understand that his surgical team is planning to kill him. <br /> <br /> The big blow, however, is very predictable and sends the film to dig into the conspiracy and its memories of the small signs that were there but to him, like us, he initially missed. <br /> <br /> There are two other twists at the end that relate to his relationship with his mother. One is an impressive gesture by Olin, which is insignificant due to bad writing. The other is a secret about the family's past that seemed very attached and useless. <br /> <br /> The anesthetic awareness drama initially well done is lost in the conspiracy drama written poorly. There is a last attempt to bring him back down that falls flat, taking the whole movie with him.
