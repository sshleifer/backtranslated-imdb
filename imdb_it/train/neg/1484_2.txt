please don't rent or think about buying this movie. They don't even have it available at the red rented box that would cost a $ 1 and I think it's worth less. The main reason I rented this film was because Jenna Jameson is in the film lol in 2-5 minutes. I'll give credit that the movie had chicks and a lot of nudity, but other than that you could also buy another horror movie that has the same thing with Ginger Lynn has more time to star in this film than Jenna and it's not not even on the film's cover or its name. I recommend people to watch the strippers, because you see Jenna for almost the whole movie and most of the time. This film is a great disappointment and such a huge waste of time.
