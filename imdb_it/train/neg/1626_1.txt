This film has appeared on local TV here in South Africa recently and I thought that I would have warned even those who like to watch bad B movies (which I do) which is not even funny. The plot is about a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and ... The problem is that most of the film, obviously shot in the early seventies, consists of extremely large shots of people walking, in real time and terribly slowly, from A to B. This makes the film in the extreme and the expected gain of blood and blood never happens. I'm really curious - how many people actually looked at this from beginning to end?
