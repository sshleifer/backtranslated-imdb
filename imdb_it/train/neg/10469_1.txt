Yes, I admit I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing, I couldn't help but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First with the Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) on their program, and now this. <br /> <br /> The Omega Code follows a stream of imprecise religiously oriented films. It was quite fun, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. The film follows what is known as "the code of the Bible" rather than following the true biblical writings. This film is extremely badly done; from his writing to directing to his horrible hilarious acting. It is depressing that people actually question this film. It felt more like a late night movie that someone would watch on the US channel or on a video right from home rather than a movie released in theaters. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you not to watch this movie, even if your life depended on it.
