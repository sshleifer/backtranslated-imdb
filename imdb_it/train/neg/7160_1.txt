Well - when the cameo aspect of Jason Miller (which seems even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV) is the highest point of a photo, what do you have? <br /> <br /> He's a bit of a country, a little rock n 'roll: he mixes two drunks with the money that drags their child everywhere with a dry mummy (you found one still out - DRY in a swamp?) in the basement, Christopher Walken with a bad dyeing job, and a little girl who could have been an interesting character if they had developed it. <br /> <br /> I understand - kind of - that they will return to visit their relatives. After that .... <br /> <br /> Problem: There are several interesting flashbacks about what I suppose his mother was killed in a car bomb (I think). This is never connected to anything. <br /> <br /> Problem: what do we need grandma for? Now, the grandmother could be interesting. He speaks Gaelic, or Celtic, or something like that. Maybe you can do something about her. The best they can do is that they have a tobacco habit. That's all. <br /> <br /> Problem: They launch a real elusive character like her husband. Is he a cast of type (will he sell his wife to the devil? Maybe he can't wait to get the trust fund he runs for her) or does he go against the guy (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? Drinks, hesitates. He is not a bad boy. Not good. But questionable. Why didn't they do something with him? <br /> <br /> No problem: an old boyfriend arrives. The husband knocks him down. Come back to take down her husband. (He gets pretty stupid, but at least THIS character has motivations.) <br /> <br /> NOW - he's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he could only marry her for his money. The grandmother is locked in the bedroom. The blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her a witch's mummy (are you following this?) That could come to life. In fact, if you know that you will come to life, the music will swell. A little girl lives at home, brings tea to her grandmother (opens the door to do so) and supplies her grandmother with cigarettes. Periodically, the grandmother goes out. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and wife lose their child at home, subsequently losing their bedroom. Uncle gets his throat cut in the basement. The main character has nose bleeds. The husband drinks. Both drink. Faced with all this, the horrible truth alluded to in the first over-entry is - omegod - an abortion when the protagonist was twelve. <br /> <br /> Despite all this barbed wire ingredients, nobody was able to get a story on the screen. No bridges between situations, no gradation from slight disturbance to horrible horror, only slow and slow scenes that go nowhere. No one, really, to look after - and they had places to go with that look - the innocent boy in the drunken responsibility, the grandmother who could be locked up because he's a monster, but no, his worst fault is smoking. She has beautiful hair, a nice makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, no plot. Just a little random (predictable) violence in a dark library, with the rain gushing and the soundtrack pushing us inside. You need more than a couple of drunks and Christopher Walken to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​were good. Oh. Nice view, good wardrobe. The cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. Poor me.
