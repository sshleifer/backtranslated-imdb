Looking at That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be directed by Marlene Dietrich. Someone at 20th Century Fox may have decided that a sexual symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known. <br /> <br /> Betty plays a nineteenth-century Italian countess whose rule was invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. His ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall together to the rest of his illustrious family tree, he sees no small resemblance in Doug now and in another invader some 300 years earlier with which he faced the failure of armies. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion came at an inconvenient time, before things had been completed. This will give anyone a negative attitude, I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> Fresh, healthy, all American Betty is NOT the seductive and mysterious actress. Marlene Dietrich may have put it aside, but with Betty she fell more flat than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry, although Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can look at in anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the soundtrack for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for best song. The occasion of Lady Lady In Ermine for the glory of the Oscars is touched at Buttons and Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died in the middle of the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the command here. Not even for you if you see That Lady In Ermine.
