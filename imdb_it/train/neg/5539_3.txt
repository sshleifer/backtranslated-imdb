The Wimpy Armand Louque shirt (blandly interpreted by veteran actor Dean Jagger in a rare leading role) joins a group of researchers who want to find and destroy the secret technique of zombie creation. Armand falls in love with the beautiful Claire Duval (who takes the blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses the mild sap to convince Armand Clifford's colleague Grayson (the desperately wooden Robert Noland) to marry her. Furious at being used and rejected by Claire, Armand uses his knowledge of voodoo to take revenge. Sounds exciting? Well, of course it's not. For beginners, the (non) static direction of Victor Halperin lets the winding and smoothly speaking plot follow at a lancinating and slow pace. Worse still, Halperin fails to bring any tension, atmosphere and momentum to the horrible boring processes. Most blah acting from a largely insipid cast does not help matters; only George Cleveland as the generous General Duval and E. Alyn Warren as the irascible Dr. Trevissant manage to animate things a little with their welcome and refreshing histrionic hammam. The sparkling soundtrack of the series, the insignificant stages on stage and the rough cinematography are rather bad and not very impressive. Indeed, this weak excuse for a frightening aspect is so crumbling that not even the impassive and unaccredited looks of the great Bela Lugosi can alleviate mindless boredom to the brain. An excessively boring disaster.
