I took this Cuban film in an arthouse filmmaker. It was shown shortly after the masterly comic strip Silly Symphony of 1935 in which the Island of the Symphony is reconciled with the Island of Jazz. With the late Ruben Gonzalez he produced the speakers of this old ballroom-cinema and a Cuban flag hanging from peeling of rocaille stucco motifs, the scene was prepared for a riproing celebration of committed and synchronized hysteria films against idiocy of Helms-Burton. But then the film started. And the crumbling film of cinema has gradually become more interesting than the cheap mess on the screen. <br /> <br /> The plot of Nada Mas promises a lot. Carla is a bored envelope printer in a Cuban post office. His only escape from a rather banal existence is to enclose letters and rewrite them, transforming the basic interpersonal grunts into BrontÃ«ne explosions of breathless emotions. Cue numerous shots of photogenic Cubans that spring from joy, pain, pity, terror and the like. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the simplicity of the narration is marked by endless excursions in the art of cinema, caricature in Latin, Marx brothers slapstick and even - during a picky editing trick - the scratch in celluloid of one carved carved on a character's face. <br /> <br /> One-dimensional characters abound. Cunda, the head of the post office, is a nosferatu who dominates humor. His startled-eyed accomplice, Concha, points his fingers, interceptions, and squeals differently. Cesar, the metal ferret and romantic interest, reveals the talent of hidden writing when Carla leaves for Miami. A chase scene (in such a hilarious fast-forward) is launched for good measure. All this would be fine in a Mortadello and Filemon comic, but in a black-and-white, non-FX movie with intellectual pretensions, ahem. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas attempts to ride the style somewhere between Amelie's 'eccentric-heroine-matchmakes-stranger' and Il Postino's theme 'poetry-as-great-redeemer'. Like Amelie, her protagonist is an eccentric single white woman who fights an incumbent spinster trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers. And like Il Postino, the film does not stray from sustained poetry recitals and a postman on a bicycle takes on a romantic advantage. Unfortunately, Nada Mas fails to capture the rigor and transcendence of both films. <br /> <br /> There are two things that might deserve to watch this movie in a late-night television slumber. The first is Carla's header on a checkerboard floor, which she cuts to the crossword she's working on. The second is to see Nada Mas as an example of caution: our post-Buena Vista Social Club obsession with Cuban artistic production often winks at us to accept any dross that has a bongo on the soundtrack. This film should not have deserved a global publication - films like Waiting List and Guantanamera cover similar thematic territories with much more success.
