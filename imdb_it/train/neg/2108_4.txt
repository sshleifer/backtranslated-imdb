A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while they are at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. Journalist Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. She discovers that just before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (presumably by the groom) that contained a powerful drug that succumbed to them. Patricia is told that the orchid was first cultivated by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives on an isolated estate with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for the crimes, putting the brides in a suspended state and using their glandular fluid to keep his wife eternally young. Patricia, along with Dr. Foster (who is working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force Dr. Lorenz's hand into organizing a fake marriage, which eventually leads Patricia into the clutches of the mad doctor. This film had an excellent opening lap, but in practice it ended up with too many twists and other weak scenes. The cast is decent, Walters and Coffin deserved better, but this is life. Russell steals the show (even outside Hamini - which does not offer one of his most memorable performances, considering also his Monograms) as the Countess Lorenz who plays the role with the qualities of many of the stereotyped features of many of today's first Hollywood donnas. Final weak and forced as well. Evaluation, based on film B, 4.
