I saw this movie in a pre-screening at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. I remember that the producers and the director of the film were present, presumably to stimulate our reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes evoked laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it had to be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the public were not afraid, it seems they were the directors. They delayed the release for over a year. Out of curiosity, I saw him again to see if they would cut it; as far as I can tell, they didn't have. It was the same bad film, just one year old. <br /> <br /> It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
