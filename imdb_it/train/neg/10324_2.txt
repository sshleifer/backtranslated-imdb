The small mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way of producing the simplest possible comedy programming for the most easily offended viewers, which for CBC means 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deadly lame I can't believe it. The performances are very engaging and more than acting, but I don't blame the actors because those types of stereotyped one-dimensional characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and requested. Spectacular show with bad jokes that they tried to present as "controversial" well is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
