There is so much wrong with this film, but to summarize: Terrible acting: so bad it must have been on purpose. poor script - they may have had good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story. bad end - in some cases the final manages to save the film - not in this case. if you can sit down for the whole movie, you'd like to kick yourself at the end because the ending isn't even worth the wait. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. It was a complete torture during this film, I would have appreciated someone who warned me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this movie only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then you will regret being subjected to untold torture.
