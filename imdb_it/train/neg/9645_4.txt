It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a huge clamor that is proving to be a real box office bum. London Dreams is no exception. Let's analyze it ... It's all about chasing your dreams and how far you are going to reach it. Sounds awesome, doesn't it? But unfortunately the film is not. <br /> <br /> Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to grow up someday. His dream is to perform at Wembley Stadium in front of 90,000 cheering spectators who call his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy and Ranvijay) and a compelling Priya (Asin). Together they form "London Dreams" their dream band. After hitting the head of a record company, they become nocturnal sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya who doesn't want to reveal until he reaches his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree and flirty boy who had no ambitions in life, to join their band. Mannu is an experienced musician and a true talent for whom Arjun will become envious of Mannu's superior abilities and his relationship with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to defeat Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the films. <br /> <br /> Turning to the technical aspects, we only hear the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha that we admired in Namaste London. It just seemed like he was viewing the script. In short, a glorified cameraman. Suresh Nair's script is boring even if it has its moments. Predictably defined, the script bored you to stiffen you. Working with the camera was fantastic in capturing the beauty of London. It's the only fun part when you watch the songs. <br /> <br /> Few songs are humble while others are noisy. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and annoys you. Asin is forgettable and I don't think it will make him great in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is absolutely OK. Toast like the bitch is what we've seen in countless movies. Ompuri is underway with the proceeding. I don't want to flatten myself on the defects as it will be a Herculean task. <br /> <br /> Finally let it be simple and straightforward, London Dreams is a soulless film that you can enjoy better on DVD.
