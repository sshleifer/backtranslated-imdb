This film may have been the biggest disappointment I experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. Overall, I simply found this second-rate film. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly passable as the anti-hero and Ma Wu manages his character with cheerful competence. On the other hand, Ma Wu's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously fake that I simply couldn't take it seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed for Halloween, complete with a $ 4.95 beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so-so, even if the "undead" in the cellar were quite good. The language of the tree looked like something of a bad monster movie from the 1950s, although the POV language shots looked more like those of Sam Raimi in the more recent "Evil Dead" trilogy. The fireworks were a ho-hum and the final battle is as boring as it can get. (Indeed, it reminds me more of the episode "Lost in Space" in which the Robinsons are caught in a sandstorm and ....) <br /> <br /> The plot was not particularly original and the countless times have been told in the form of European fairy tales. There was no suspense and twists. In fact, you know it right away when you are introduced to the characters that are good, who is bad and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix and then sat down to write this review. The first thing I did was check the production date. Yes, says 1987 ... not 1967 which I thought could be. And this basically sums up: production and FX values ​​are typical of the 1960s. The plot and the action seem much older, as Hollywood was producing some interesting and inspiring films in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
