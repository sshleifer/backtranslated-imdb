A typical 70s Italian film, original and good music, but with some strangeness, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confusing plot (for example the role of the wolf dog and where does the boy come from?) With little dialogue, beautiful atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The reason why it is still (relatively) well known and sought after is probably the nude scenes (including the typical pseudo-coitus of the 70s) involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with a older teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - it is interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the United States) 30 years ago, while now it is more what a taboo. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around the bullying of a girl (Laura) with the other two characters, and her discovery of sex, a fairly accurate representation of an adolescent appearance. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not evolve until the end of the film and already appears very experienced in the erotic arts - there is no "advanced age" for her: she is a very vain girl who already knows her sexual charm, but in the end it is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl who is still really. The boy is a completely contemptible bully, while Laura comes across a very naive and weak victim.
