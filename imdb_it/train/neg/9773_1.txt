When it was released, I thought it was one of the most profane films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and other filmmakers like him, there have been worse films regarding the language than this film .... but this is a rather brutal attack on the ears. Hey, I can take a lot, but it's ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard half a dozen uses of the Lord's name in vain plus an incalculable number of f-words. I wonder how many people left the theater to watch this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, some of the protagonists included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film was released, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least by playing Jackson's Godon "Stonewall" in "Gods and Generals". Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trash person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Depressive, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just some of the adjectives that people use - even some liberal critics - in describing this story, which is depicted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the best-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the film. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as were almost all payers. It is incredible that someone could praise the dirt and the garbage in this way. <br /> <br /> Believe me on this: there are no good and nice characters in this whole movie. This is a bad film, sick: one of the worst of the "modern era". That is, unless you like to see child abuse, drug abuse, teenage prostitutes, and so on - two consecutive hours of nothing but atrocities and simply evil people. No thanks.
