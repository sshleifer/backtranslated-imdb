I think if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the English bass set to invent a script, it would make more sense than that. I could then go to the first-year theater group and play better than jokers in this film. This sounds really bad, but I'm sure they did it as a joke and are completely aware of possessing (see what I did there?) Nor the skills to recite or write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> Watch this only if you are incredibly drunk, up high or need a good excuse as to why your decomposing body was found with wrists cut off. Now I will go to my fish bowl and collect all the poop at the bottom. Next, I will model it in the form of a disc and insert it into my DVD player, expecting it to produce something much better than this trumpery. <br /> <br /> Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 breast - 9/10
