Merry fools in London stage a treasure hunt, with a young woman inadvertently staring at her married political father with a strong and independent woman who has never been in love. Intriguing vehicle in advance for Katharine Hepburn, playing an aviatrix similar to Amelia Earhart who was too involved to let any man go. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why did all the old cliches remain intact as frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the type of whining and whining wife who goes to bed when things go wrong and Hepburn's final scene is another sin. A curious artifact, but not a classic for Kate observers. ** from ****
