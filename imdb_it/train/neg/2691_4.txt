Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. It usually offers solid performance, as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. Here, too, it does quite well, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, poor writing and so-so photography. The Miller-Movie formula gives a 4. Richard gets a 5.
