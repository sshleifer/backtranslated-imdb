I'd like to start by saying that I'm not a fan of horror movies. I never look at them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... <br /> <br /> The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see him Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we didn't really expect it to be good ... actually we went to laugh about it. Fantastic with me ... I have a problem ruining the film for other people in the theater, but since they were just other couples talking and understanding, it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes the 2 other people left to sneak into Borat, a movie that I would happily have seen again on this. The film was not scary, and not stupid so it would have been fun ... it was just boring. It wasn't terrible like "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was terrible like ... not funny at all. To avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not an expert, but nowadays the problem with the horror industry is that you can have a boring and not scary horror PG-13, or you can have a horrible R movie horrible that it is too bloody or too disgusting for people. <br /> <br /> Want a horror PG-13 that sucks but is fun? See "Grudge". Avoid this movie like the plague ... because it could literally bore you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
