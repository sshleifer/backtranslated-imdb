Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "baby eruptions" (they have pills for that now!) It is probably the weakest element of this show. The Highlander series tired formula really continues - The immortal hero meets another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is a conflict, and in the end there is a sword fight where you have a sequence of special effects at low cost. <br /> <br /> So you have the character of Nick Wolf. In practice, the typical hero of the 90s with a long beard, with the typical plot of "sexual tension". (Seriously, because Hollywood guys think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a French-Canadian production, so half of the series takes place in Vancouver, imitating New York, and the other half is in Paris ... just like Highlander did.
