This "movie" is one of the most terrible things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and avoid this incompetent concoction. <br /> <br /> Shaking the camera and having your actors adopt scowls does not count as "direction", which this film needs en masse. Not that the script was wonderful, but we were left with a group of completely artificial characters headed in that most artificial way (the pseudo-documentary "style" appreciated by those who don't know how to direct). <Br /> <br /> This film gives the impression that it has been cynically appealed to critics who do not know the first thing about making films (which is most of them). <br /> <br /> Simply terrible. He says a lot about Sundance and what it has become that Victor Vargas was introduced there.
