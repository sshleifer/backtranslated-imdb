This film was so ugly that it was ridiculous. I couldn't resist looking at it though. The plot is standard, the acting is pretty horrible (the supporting cast like the mad neighbor and the lawyer friend were the best actors). It's fun if you have time to lose and you like to see the end of a dramatic plot. <br /> <br /> The headliner who plays "Kathy" was simply fascinating because I could not decide if his flat and impassive effect was the result of bad surgery or just bad acting (I decided it was both of them). This leaves the script to comment, which was pretty horrible. Pat's remarks, idiotic decisions and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the film. Perhaps this was what was so compelling; I do not know. I just saw it to see how bad it could be. (Actually the dialogue does not even qualify to be called "clich√©" "- but it is almost completely useless.) <br /> <br /> All in all, very bad, an economic film. The sets, the same scenes (one house, a building) have been shown over and over again without real art or real action constraints, more like random props that have fallen into action in a bad game.A chase scene could have been shot by any young man in a warehouse or in an old school: badly shot, inexpensive props, minimal action ... and I still wanted to see the ending. Go figure.
