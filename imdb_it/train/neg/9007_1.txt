This movie is one of the worst crap I've ever seen. I literally had a severe pain in my head while watching this movie. The CGI was horrible and the story was just a waste of ink. Dean Cain's character was Mr-Super-Intuitive-I-can-out-anything, except that his helicopter doesn't seem to be working properly. The biggest problem was working with split-screen cameras. I felt like I was looking at the Brady Bunch or something, just that there were no different people in the boxes, just close together and different views of the same thing. I can only imagine that the actors really needed the money, because this film was not worth the movie in which it was shot.
