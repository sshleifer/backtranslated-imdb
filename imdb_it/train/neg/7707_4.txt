With a title like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!", Anyone who enters this thing would expect a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy that mocks bad science fiction movies. It should be a mix of both, with a dose of spray parody. Unfortunately, it falls to the ground very soon. <br /> <br /> You should never take this movie seriously, I realize, but you should think it's funny, right? I found only a few funny jokes or situations (for example the side-by-side telephone conversations, the Russian Olympic spy who ate steroid cereals, Superman who walked with Lois, etc.). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" strives to be a cult classic, but does not make it. A cult classic is a film so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" could be appreciated by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film. <br /> <br /> There is a good actress in the whole affair: Sharon Taylor as Lois Fairchild. She is a thin and frail journalist, but has a captivating personality, likes to deal with alcohol, and is a natural comedian. Unfortunately, it gets bad here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" is not as fun as, for example, "Amazon Women on the Moon" or "Kentucky Fried Movie", but it does have some hilarious moments, so I would recommend seeing it one time. He avoids the director's cut, he has some interruptions from the film's producer and some alleged "lost" footage doubled in a fake African dialect (it can be found in English on the finished tape).
