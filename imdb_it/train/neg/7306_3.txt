Truly one of the most terrible films I've ever seen. I never took the time to write one, but I felt compelled to witness this affront to making a film and I feel a little sorry to waste time with a piece like that to be honest. There were so many parts that infuriated me with their total randomness and meaninglessness (for example, when the police would ever shoot people with infectious diseases? When did hospitals ever escape these people for lack of care? who spied on his wife wandering outside in her dressing gown while carrying a gun while rolling over on the bed? Moreover, the characterization - as we almost expected in these films - was terrible (for example the way the blond boy - I don't remember the nosy name and doesn't care anyway - turned completely against his girlfriend and ran away to leave her) and I ended up wanting everyone to meet the macabre tips! The production has been horribly disjointed and the cinematography has nothing to tell.
