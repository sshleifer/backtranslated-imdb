Wow, I can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie. Now, I've seen a lot worse, but there are many more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film at best. While the acting was not terrible, but not exceptional, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There have been many outstanding points that do not arise or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters come out as complete cowards. They don't know each other well enough to realize that they don't like the people they are engaged to. How do we know they are not in love? With the absolute lack of remorse that both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of a few more romantic things than the continuous escape from the commitment that these two shows. <br /> <br /> The film does not even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will have cold feet and others will fall like hot potatoes, once a commitment approaches. This film is about two people who can not engage in anything, unlike the previous Cusack characters, who were more than willing to engage deeply (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this film was the total absence of turning twists or anything of interest. At the end of the film, it seemed to me that I had not included a climax in the story, which basically fits the whole film: boring. No suspense that the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the lack of this film, that they simply reproach any criticism with "Everyone is too cynical!". The criticism of this film is not cynicism, simply impartial examination. There are many other romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is fantastic, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There is something about Mary (which is a good examination of romanticism idealized against today's society).
