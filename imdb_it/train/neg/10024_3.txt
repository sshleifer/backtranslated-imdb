First lesson that some directors (especially those inspired by Hollywood) need to know - only "style" does not sell. I imagine Tashan will translate the style. Second, if you're determined to sell style, this won't spare you a decent story. <br /> <br /> Tashan has a story that could be enough with a better director. But it's not smooth. For example, all three - Saif, Kareena and Akshay - are storytellers at different points in the story. But this configuration is not used correctly. There could have been a better mix and match of their narratives. The sequences of actions are from the seventies. <br /> <br /> The georeography of the film is terrible. I think Vaibhavi Merchant just slept in this movie. Vishal-Shekhar got a good score but does not belong to this film. Why is there a Sufi song (Dil Haara) in Tashan? Why isn't the cool song Hinglish (Dil Dance Maare) on Anil Kapoor when he's crazy about English? <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the saving grace of the film. But he is in his stereotyped self. You won't mind losing this movie.
