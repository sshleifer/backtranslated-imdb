Originally broadcast as a movie of the ABC week. This involves two innocent young university students who are transported to a prison camp in a small southern town. Phone calls are not allowed and nobody knows they are there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation that lead to a very disturbing conclusion. <br /> <br /> The TV version was (for its time) sad. No nudity and beatings were quite docile, but the general feeling of sleaziness brought one less. The unrated version is even worse: there is abundant nudity, violence is extreme and, in a particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying prisoner forced to undress while a lesbian guard "uses" her. HOW DISGUSTING! There is nothing wrong with exploitative films, but this is limited to bypassing it. You have the feeling that the filmmakers like to have these poor women tortured and degraded - all this is pushed into your face as if you should enjoy it. The ending unnecessarily downbeat does not help. <br /> <br /> I give him a 3 because the acting is good, but that makes the movie more difficult to watch. A sick and squalid film. Not recommended.
