Stupid and simple bizarre film about a boy who becomes traumatized when he discovers that Santa is not real (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who creates lists of bad or nice people. A Christmas shoots and sets off to kill the bad people - dressed as Santa Claus, of course. <br /> <br /> To boring and simply bad cinema. If you're looking for blood, it's not here. Only some of the murders are shown and they are not so bloody with VERY false effects. Most of the film contains only Brandon Maggart who speaks for himself and slowly goes mad. The script is trivial, the acting is terrible and leads to a finale that made me gape the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and look at it again to make sure you don't have hallucinations! Truly a really poor ending. <br /> <br /> If you want a fierce Christmas "Black Christmas" flick (original 70s version --- NOT the terrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
