When I took this film for free from my work, along with three other similar films .. I then looked at very low expectations. Now this film is not bad by itself. You get what you pay for. It's a love story, betrayal, lies, sex, scandals, everything you want in a movie. It's definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it's not so bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell, this is the kind of movie you would see late at night at a local TV station that just wants to take time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local TV station that is trying to take some time. Despite the bad acting, the clich√© lines and the work with the secondary camera. I didn't want to turn off the movie and pretend it never turned up in my DVD player. The story has been made many times in many films. This is no different, it is not better, it is not worse. <br /> <br /> Only your average movie.
