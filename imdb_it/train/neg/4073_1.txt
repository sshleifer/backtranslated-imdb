NO SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, but this must be the poorest attempt to make one. Calling it "a movie" is also a trait. This "haphazard-of-obviously-fake-and-bad-violence-and-a-bad-woman-trying-to-act-sexy-badly-together-clip" is not worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Watching this is interesting to see the holiday photos of a casual family, and it has the same quality you would expect when you send your ten-year-old son into the woods with your new videocam, and tell him to do a movie. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
