I read all the reviews here AFTER having looked at this piece of junk film and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else didn't think that this terribly annoying montage was NOT the culmination of humor in the 70s or even in any other era! If this is not the least fun set of sketch * comedy * I've ever seen, it will do so until it arrives. Half of the sketches had already been done (and infinitely better) by acts like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I had to say that a good piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film, it would still not be comes close to summarizing how wasted this 75-minute waste is straight and straight. Seminal Comedy? Only in the world where seminal really means seed. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is actually feces. Precursor jokes? Only if by that we mean that this is a manual on how NOT to do comedies. Tits and tramps and the strange beaver. Nice ... if you're a pubescent boy with at least one free hand and you haven't found out that Playboy exists. Give him a break because it was the early 1970s? There's no way. There had been a sketch comedy dating back at least ten years. The only way I could even forgive this film was that it was under the threat of a gun. Back? Almost. Clowns of clowns that subtly pervert children can be at the forefront in some circles (and actually may have been fun), but it's actually pretty sad. What made me go on for all 75 minutes? Pure conviction of having saved a really funny skit for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to sleepless patients or coma ... or perhaps to people suffering from trismus ... their jaws will definitely open for the disbelief.
