My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the film should have at least been worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British, but speak with American accents is, for me, impossible to overcome - hard to believe that it is England when nobody speaks with a British accent. There is no chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another for no reason is ridiculous. There is no reason to worry about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway. I found it difficult to believe that Hawks directed this, as none of the actors talked about delivering the Hawksian rat-a-tat brand. So save your time and skip this.
