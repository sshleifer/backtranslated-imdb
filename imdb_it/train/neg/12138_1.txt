Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID bounces with enough stereotypes of bad character to get the writer to sign and then shoot. You could see a clear use of stunts in almost every scene. Oh, and acting also sucks. Although I have to say that the joke: "Sorry, buddy, I have to make a big dump in big time" made me laugh in the ass.
