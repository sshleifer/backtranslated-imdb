Basing a television series on the works of a popular author is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire television learned this the hard way when they bought the rights to books credited to Dick Francis in 1979, three of which were broadcast under the collective title "The Racing Game". Mike Gwilym was Sid Halley, a former jockey who became private after an accident in which he lost his right hand and then replaced it with an artificial one. Gwilym suffered from an acute lack of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys) while Mick Ford (who played the irritating Chico Barnes) made me think of a horse's ass every time he was on the screen. For six weeks, this duo that was anything but dynamic took charge of the campaign, foiling nefarious plots to fix the races, usually with the same methods: blackmail, kidnappers or doping horses. Yorkshire television threw money at the show, but without success. Violent, sexist, far-fetched and repetitive, he was quickly transported to the yard of the unfortunate.
