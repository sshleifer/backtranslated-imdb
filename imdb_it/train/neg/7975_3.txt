While sitting in front of the TV watching this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could have done with this!" Chances are, you will too. Start intriguing. A ranger from the British park who lives in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a cute and shy brunette woman (Lisa Zane) whom she met in a park only a short time ago. Then, one day she disappears. The police are unable to find any documentation that ever existed and Firth conducts his own research. So far, so good. Just as he is about to surrender, he turns to his best friend the womanizer (Billy Zane), and stumbles upon his previous life in the sordid subsoil of drugs, nightclubs and the most beloved cinema in Los Angeles, and then in his story of mental instability. At that point, Firth's life is in danger and the movie collapses. None of Lisa Zane's characters from the past is remotely interesting. The film moves slowly and there is very little action. There is a subplot as far as the missing drug money is concerned, but it's just a throw away. No chase, no overhanging sequence and no suspense. Just some boring beats and lots of talk from boring characters. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear together in a scene. At the end of the film, you are torn between wondering what it might have been and trying to stay awake.
