This is perhaps the most boring film in history. I was looking forward to seeing this film seen by actor / director Roman Polanski. I think I'd rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie again. He promptly switched from the DVD player directly to the trash. My apologies to those of you who apparently enjoyed this movie, but you probably like New Coca-Cola too. I can't understand why someone would have liked this movie, it's slow, boring and has no storyline. Wait 105 minutes to start the film. I understand that this was done in 1976, but this was a time of bad television all around. Thanks to God Disco and Three's Company they went together with glasses for stop signs and Bay City Rollers. Oh well, just my thoughts.
