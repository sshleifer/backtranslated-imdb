Oh the hilarity! Oh, joy! Another movie that is so bad is good! Or, so I thought. In reality, this is missing the "so bad is good" phase and goes, sadly, directly to "it may have been so bad it's good, but they have ruined everything and put it wrong". <br /> <br /> To begin with, it's too long. Cut half an hour and it could be more bearable. So put yourself in ridiculous plots like "the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the Earth, because he has all the food he has accumulated and he will be rich if the mission fails!". Duh! Or the device for the plot of the "talking bomb" seen for the last time on Dark Star. Guess that .... just like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add a hyphen to "we can't go to a day care center" and have Solar Crisis in Serbian. <br /> <br /> Relief from the light comes in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants, as we called it in this film), whose sole purpose in the film is to guide a child into the desert and call the father of the child to come and get it .... in the end. Between driving and the phone call, Jack delivers useless drivel and leers and cackles a lot, but contributes little to the story, as it is. In short, it's the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> My award for "The most ironic line delivered openly" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when he first meets his eldest son, comments that his son looks a little "out of shape" while he stands there with his gut on his belt and a desperate need for a captain Kirk Corset. <br /> <br /> Even the naughty top guy, who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of Andy Warhol, for some reason, is also fun. <br /> <br /> In addition to these hilarities, there is little to recommend this film. The ending is a sequence copied from (but mercifully shorter than) the final sequence of 2001. <br /> <br /> Suggestions to enjoy this movie more, if you are foolish enough to watch it, like I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Whenever the bomb speaks, imagine it is called Tarquin (trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. Whenever Chuck Heston is on the screen and is about to speak , anticipate reciting a phrase of "Planet of the Apes" as "Take away your creepy paws!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. Whenever the female protagonist is stressed (this is most of the time) she continues to hope that she has no hope of having an aneurysm and will die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the interminable scenes "the ship broke again", continue to hope that the engineers / technicians pull out a Scotty-ism like "Don't change the laws of physics!" or something like that. <br /> <br /> In addition to this, do what you need to get yourself through this. I fell asleep halfway through and woke up to realize that I had lost nothing, and neither had the plot (however ridiculous) advanced. So don't worry about fine tuning for a few, you won't miss anything.
