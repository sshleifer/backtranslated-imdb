I read James Hawes' book. He was nice, not great, but funny enough. Without having read the book I would have had no idea what was happening, and it was still a trait with that knowledge. <br /> <br /> Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways you don't have the ability to describe. Half-digested fish could have made a better film with matches and dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before, since a movie made me feel so angry. The sequences of the Mattresses came closer, but they never reached the depth of a terrible and rotten nauseability that this bilge did. <br /> <br /> Since I am wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on mankind, now I am not even able to look at any James Hawes book without feeling angry. This is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh * t. No, that's not right. Allow me to apologize with all the fecal matter to confront you with the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Plain and simply a cancer in the world of cinema.
