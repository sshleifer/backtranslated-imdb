The script was VERY weak without enough character arrays to make you worry a bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is too talkative and not enough gore or action to call it at a slow pace. The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible, so you don't have to listen to them to talk about very silent dialogues. On a technical note, the musical mix is ​​very high and makes it difficult to understand what is said several times. Then again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have been better told in a short film with a lead time of less than 30 minutes. The obvious "face" giveaways to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they had been thinner, but here they look more like a bald rip. Come on, this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best you can do? However, cinematography, light design and shots have been really well done.
