Here is a horror version of PRISCILLA: QUEEN OF THE DESERT (which they wish!) With Melinda / Mindy (RETURN OF LIVING DEAD 3) Clarke as Candy, a desert inhabitant who takes off a bank robbery with her boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr). He ends up in a prison in the south of the border run by the sadistic Cape Vite (an overlying Robert Englund in a wig). She and her beloved domestic poodle end up hiding in a service station convent until they are transformed by a fallen meteor. The dogs turn into hateful "queen sluts" and Candy develops a very long, talking, forked tongue that she can't control. The hooligans in search of stolen loot and other assorted heaps add further complications. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and does what there is to do in this movie. You look at it and you see someone very funny during the slapstick scenes, very convincing during the horror scenes and VERY sexy in various wigs and disguises, including a tight, tight latex body ... and I wonder why this actress is not a big star. Too bad the rest of this cult attempt is not up to its promise. <br /> <br /> The director / screenwriter of the Sciama trail, who thinks that the bizarre premise alone is enough to sustain laughter ... but his vulgar gags, annoying supporting characters and stupid dialogues cannot replace a real sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the film looks cheap, a lot of bright colors and sets are strangely attenuated by muddy photography and dusty desert places. Fortunately for Sciamma Clarke is in his film, because she alone keeps you looking.
