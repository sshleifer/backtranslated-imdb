What The Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and casual look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are nominated) who digress and pontificate in an absolutely unscientific way. Their interviews are broken up into aggravating segments and scattered in some tiny cgi and trivial mini-plots. <br /> <br /> The film affects science, philosophy, theology and politics, mixes them together without any regard for accuracy and therefore somehow extrapolates some prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics is communicating to us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult questions to answer to which filmmakers would like to point the finger. <br /> <br /> They are riddled and logical errors not sequitur. How did we start from quantum mechanics and ended up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying "two plus two is equal to four, so I can move objects with my mind". <br /> <br /> There is nothing original about this film and almost nothing specific. Any discriminating spectator will be bothered by massive changes, intrusive and unnecessary special effects and general lack of substance. Polite spectators will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and by any other topic on which this film touches.
