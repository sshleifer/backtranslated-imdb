This should be my type of film. Even if he sucked, he should have been right in my alley; hell, I like the "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a weak spot in my heart for silly alien / demon / adventurous movies. Let's go further because I decided to look at this first. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-Fi almost always intrigues me 2. I'm a big fan of archeology and this film involves a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. I generally like Christian Slater and Dorf. 5. Tara Reid is hot. <br /> <br /> So this film had potential, at least in the horror cheese section of the video store, but the guy made him suck his ass. The only positive aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as fun as I do ... I mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. But now to some of the many flaws. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the film as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really terrible. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about appointing Tara Reid for the worst performance of the year. I don't know if he's capable of acting, but playing the curator of the museum is simply out of his reach ... completely. Watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist was not much different from what you get looking at the setup in nasty porn. I mean, this isn't just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't undress, just up to a bra in a silly, totally useless love scene. <br /> <br /> Even with Reid's performance, maybe the film could have worked, but the plot is what dominates and the plot seems to be written by a 10-year-old child. I hadn't realized that it was an adaptation of a video game until AFTER watching the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time. <br /> <br /> The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood to an orphanage where he gets flashbacks to something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. In his adult life Slater was recruited by some 713 units, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts for evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess, you never know unless he was in one of those dubbings I shared during. The film begins with Slater's hunting artifacts, obtaining his last piece after some dealings with a "Chilean mercenary force specialized in selling rare antiquities". I could have the exact wrong quote, but you have the idea. <br /> <br /> There is an evil doctor who wants to unleash infernations on earth (no given reason), experiments on children, super demons / human hybrid aliens, "photonic" bullets (demon things can't stand the sunlight) and, of course, Slater and Dorf to try to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can't even be about to look at the clich√© elements. The script needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide SOME depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist damn evil? Oh, right, humans are doomed and just trying to save the human race. I guess he's infected? How did it happen? Oh, he has one of the evil demon's things in a cage and he draws his blood to shoot himself. How the hell happened? Why and where he got the super snails (oh yes, they use the old science fiction stand of alien / demon parasites that "fuse" with their host's backbone) Obviously, Slater is, like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug "has not completely melted due to an electric shock", thank god. Oh, and people with these "fused" thorns have no idea that they are half-aliens / demons and act as good community members until a secret signal is given from which they turn the murderous zombies. Yes, we have zombies. <br /> <br /> So a lot of crap that could be fun, but none of that is. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the ending is completely stupid since everything turns out not to be that big of a deal to fix in the first place ... at least nothing a bit of dynamite can't handle. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst thing you'll see, but a really bad movie.
