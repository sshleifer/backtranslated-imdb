This must be one of the worst fillums I've ever seen and I've seen a few. It's slow, boring, amateur - it's not even consistent in its simplistic reading of the plot. Actors don't act. I can't blame them - they received a script of such banality that all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes that has nothing to do with SummersIsle's evil vicissitudes. <br /> <br /> There is not a moment in this film that sounds real - not an honest line nor a single moment when one is moved. The character of Nicholas Cage is so badly drawn that he does not feel like a compassionate compassion for him through all his tribulations. I have no doubt that I was seeing a suffering man up there but it was Nicholas Cage fully aware that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.
