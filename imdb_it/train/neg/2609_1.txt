This film did NOT provide ANYTHING or was worth it. After seeing it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply turned it around and could have cared less if it was fun. This is a good example of a "concept only" film - they have a concept about a film and the other details are not important because the managers know that it will do $$ based only on the initial concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Cruella leaving prison and going on probation. He no longer hates puppies, but was programmed to worship them - he simply couldn't hurt a flea. This doesn't last too long after her release and she is back to her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the film were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as the voice of Waddlesworth the bird made me hate him - and this is difficult considering I am a passionate Python fan. It was obvious he did it because they gave him a lot of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem servant, Tim McInnerny, was fun in Black Adder shows, but here he is totally wasted and not much fun. And it must have cost a couple of dollars to get GÃ©rard Depardieu but it was also completely wasted. There were also other secondary actors, but since the characters were poorly written, I'm trying to block them from my mind. <br /> <br /> In general, it would be better to just let your children watch television rather than worry about letting them see this crap.
