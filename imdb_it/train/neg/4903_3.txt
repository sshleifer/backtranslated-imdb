I am never a big fan of Taiwanese film production compared to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. The strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself a difficult audience to please because I am, in effect, a fan of independent films. However this film shows a weak plot and a slow rhythm. I found myself lost in the middle of where the plot is going. Acting certainly doesn't make it better. Rainie's acting is below his "over-act", trying to be lively and pretty. Although I must admit that it is a pleasure to watch. On the other hand, Isabella Leong plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, sorry, extremely reserved character. Overall, I find this film a disappointment.
