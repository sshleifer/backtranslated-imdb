In the beginning this film was a bit confusing. I usually like Gina Phillips, but I have to say this was a bad choice, just like her making the movie Ring Around the Rosie, which isn't even one of her good films. Jeepers Creepers was much better. However, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally blasted me and in the end it was crazy. It was Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who came to her twin sisters' funeral. He stays in a house that his sister owns and his grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is a bit sacrificing her relatives to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, which proves it. The crows have a strange part in it. When relatives fall asleep, the Ravens eat organs, so they can't go to sleep. But they do it. Basically it's all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relatives will be buried, but not dead, b / c have to suffer forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope this helps. If he doesn't, I'm sorry. I love you.
