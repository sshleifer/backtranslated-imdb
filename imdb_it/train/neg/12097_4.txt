I didn't really hope so much when I went to see this. After Mst3king, instead, with JasonX, with some friends, I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the film took itself too seriously. Do I worry about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no There are a legion of Ft13th movies that concern him anyway. At the end of the day, he's an undead serial killer, I'm not going to get that nice. <br /> <br /> Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the film with hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and at the end of the film, he had degenerated into a bad deathmatch episode of celebrities ... not just fun. <br /> <br />
