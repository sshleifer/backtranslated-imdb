Four best friends young male piggy pigs (with the accent on pigs) meet weekly in a restaurant in New York to tell about their sexual encounters in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator that gives the three bachelors in the group that leads to conflict and the inevitable "whipping". Even if the premise of the film has potential and there are some fun moments to do, on the whole the film doesn't work especially at the end, where girls are made to look no better than boys who go against the core of the story. One of those flixes of one-man band with a dozen producers, "Whipped" is likely to be appreciated only by the kind of young males who think "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
