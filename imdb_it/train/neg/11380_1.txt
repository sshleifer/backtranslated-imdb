When I saw Robotboy for the first time, I found it cool and interesting, but then I noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave, what is good / bad. The episodes became predictable. And the main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-intelligent boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who do not understand their child and his friends: fat girl and boy. Even this show has no logic. A super-modern robot that works with two AA batteries and can use many weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and superactive modes. We see two different robots, and declines the main idea of ​​the show: "The robot must learn how to behave in human society"
