Thanks God! I didn't waste my money renting it but I downloaded it! This seems to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, f useless visual effects, gore and nakedness! Away from the other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are many holes in the loop and errors in the film. OK if you have time after reading this comment, check the director's profile (Ulli Lommel). After seeing that I have an explanation of myself because the film is like this, I mean that every film directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to look for what kind of films these are directed by him, but I can finish all this by saying a strong sentence. Also for fun or to pass the time or even in situations of extreme boredom, please DO NOT LOOK AT THIS MOVIE.
