This movie is horrible. Everything in it has been done before. There is nothing original. I can't stand it when writers don't devise their story lines. <br /> <br /> A girl expresses a wish for her thirteenth birthday and wakes up as an adult. Hmm, it sounds very similar to a movie from the 80s called Big. What's even more annoying is Jennifer Garner's acting. He doesn't act like he's 13, he acts like he's stupid. <br /> <br /> From then on, you can guess the whole plot. She gets a good job and it just happens that a friend who is 13 years old works with her. Wow, how wonderful! But no ... her friend is bad and discovers her, trying to get her job. But of course she eventually wins when she comes up with a "big" idea. <br /> <br /> There is also a dancing scene in the movie I saw thousands of times before. > <br /> I hate this movie.
