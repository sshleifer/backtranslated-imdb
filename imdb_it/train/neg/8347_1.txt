The title should have been "The walker". He was the only one who walked. <br /> <br /> There was nothing in the film that was beautiful. The description of the film is not really consistent with the plot. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can get from the movie is that he was a good son, but a low-level person. <Br /> <br /> I'm sorry that you spend my money and time on this movie. I've seen people come out of the theater in the middle of the movie. I was hoping it would be better .... what a mistake. I got worse. <br /> <br /> If there is a suggestion I can make the producer is to re-direct his life to another field, because making movies is definitely not his cup of tea
