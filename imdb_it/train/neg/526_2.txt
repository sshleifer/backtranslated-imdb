Almost tiring to watch as much as reading, Evening is a wonderfully produced failure ... until Meryl Streep quietly enters and shows other cast members how to play this sort of thing. Vanessa Redgrave is upset in her role as Ann and Claire Danes, who is dying. Perhaps if Vanessa and Claire had changed roles, we could have seen the vivacity of young Ann that allowed her to enter the rarefied world of history and we could have imagined that old Ann was actually dying. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the addition of Michael Cunningham to the screenplay titles would have smoothed out the sober narrative but, alas. He gave me a headache.
