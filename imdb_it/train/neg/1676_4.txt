Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors who give decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Famous for his endowments, a drug addict and a boy who, despite the contraction of AIDS, continued to make films for adults, is not an intriguing character. <br /> <br /> The plot surrounds the events leading to and the consequences of a fierce mass murder in the late 1980s in Los Angeles, to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and which end he was acquitted. Just as in the case of OJ, the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, was quite high in the "He did it" area. <br /> <br /> There is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a selfish criminal. There is nothing really remotely interesting here.
