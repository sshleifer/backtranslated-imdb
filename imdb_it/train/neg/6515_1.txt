This is not a boring film, the audience could remain in its armchair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both filmmaker and actor here. The plot is simple: after a divorce and ten years of non-Hollywood career, the author is a search for love in front of the camera. The first question concerns how true this is: what is written, what came by chance? Both answers, "yes" or "no" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human being. If you are looking for a love autobiography like this, I suggest you read some independent comic books: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... <br /> <br /> Beside that, I felt rather disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know that Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (it could be true then), etc., And surely French (and the whole world) has many pains against America, but why so much hate? I don't think this film will appeal to me just for that anyway.
