I love John Saxon in whatever he is. The only time he takes the camera back, he directs a film that should have been more appropriate entitled "Please Do Not Watch This Movie Called: Zombie Death House". The $ 1000 Shock insurance certificate is the difficult way Fred Olen Ray makes you spend $ 14 on a filmed landfill produced by a legend of the 1970s cheese. Ray is the front man of RetroMedia. Ray, by the way, makes the Charles Band look warmer than the stucco ceilings of a Ford Falcon. Simply ugly now, both, and even boring. It's great that Ray is digging this old stuff and in some cases it is in the public domain like the rest of the dollar video mollusks, but in the case of Zombie Death House- (the word "Zombie" unfairly superimposed to add property and interest to the part of FOR) THE ONLY WAY OF MAKING THE SERVICE TO THIS TRIPA IS TO USE IT ON THE DOLLAR MARKET FOR THE CURIOUS COLLECTOR AND THE VENTILATED OF THE SAXONY !!! If you want to see the real Saxon, take Black Christmas, Nightmare on Elm Street or The Glove.
