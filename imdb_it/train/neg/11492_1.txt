How can a big German TV station broadcast a mess like this? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John behaves in a very poor way - especially in the double murder scene - as amateurish .......! The screen plane is very, very large - perhaps to fill 2 parts of the film. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, eg the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version sound and dubbing are very scarce - probably the reason: different languages ​​of actors - but: other international productions manage it in a much more professional way. Tip: DON'T look: it's a diabolical waste of time!
