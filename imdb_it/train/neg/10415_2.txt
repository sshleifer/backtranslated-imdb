2 stars out of a possible 10 - and this is too generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how it could be missing. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I just wonder what kind of drugs Sam Shepard had over the weekend that he pulled this dribbling piece. I suspected for a long time that Sam S. was a bit crazy, this film, based on his way of playing, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the type of artsy b.s. those actors LOVE sinking their teeth as it gives them the chance to emulate endlessly. However, for the viewer in this senseless garbage, there is absolutely NOTHING to love this movie. <br /> <br /> You haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this group. Pa is crazy, But she is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yes, crazy. They also have their mouths on them saying words that would make a sailor blush, especially his teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that were not enough, the plot - and it is so thin you could read it in depth - has a hole in it the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> But he is conspiring to sell their dilapidated farm. As it turns out, so is Pa. Now I don't claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, the jointly owned property must have both owners' signatures in order to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not sell it legally, so it would be useless to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this fundamental fact, and therefore, his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else worked anyway. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason for anyone to have to watch this movie is if I'm absolutely desperate for James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to.
