<br /> <br /> This movie sucks. It reminded me of the movie Resurrection (Christopher Lambert), which I found extremely boring. And "Semana Santa" is in any case an even poorer film. <br /> <br /> Only a beautiful cast who does something for this film is Alida Valli. Alida is one of the great old ladies in the history of European cinema. I loved his manic looks in "Suspiria" and "hell" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time dealing with this film. I'll say another good thing about this movie ... use it if you want to fall asleep very quickly ...
