Actually I saw this movie in the theater in its original version. It was painful to see Peter Sellers embarrassed so much. The story was incredibly lame and difficult to follow, and the ending was ridiculous. It was just sad to see how the powerful had fallen. I'm not going to be a big fan of Peter Sellers, but I really liked the Pink Panther series and I heard he gave a strong interpretation in Being There. But this film should never have been made. From what I read, he pursued the production of this film against the opinion of the people around him. Well, that doesn't justify the fact that the studio actually published the film.
