'Major Payne' is a film about a major that makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not have much to offer, but offers several hilarious moments that deserve to be seen. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The clash between Major Payne and the chubby boy was exhilarating, and this is really all I remember from the movie except for the guys who want revenge on Major Payne. Again, it's not a great movie, and it's probably best to watch it on a rainy day when you need to laugh.
