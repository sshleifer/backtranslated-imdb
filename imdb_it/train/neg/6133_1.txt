Kurt Thomas plays Jonathan Cabot as a kind of gymnast who trains for a special game that involves being hunted by a group of ninjas, but those ninjas will have no chance, especially since Cabot is a gymnast! Overall, Gymkata is a hellish film, the atrocious acting, the terrible script and the really incompetent direction make the quality below human standards, however this film is so terrible that it becomes really, really fun. I mean with dialogues like "I know I'll put them to sleep!" or "Ha !, your link!" add only to the simulated value that Gymkata gets more then. Furthermore, it is (Wisely) the only film that is a hero, a gymnast who finds things to swing in the heat of the moment.
