I saw him recently at the 2009 Palm Springs International Film. This is the directorial debut of veteran Dutch actress Monique van de Ven and based on my observation it should be the last. I hate movies that are so implausible that you are tearing down virtually every scene. This film lets you immediately scratch your head. while starting a young photographer and his girlfriend working for an international humanitarian organization they are quietly crossing the Taliban-controlled mountains in Afghanistan, conversing about their love when a rocket stops a truck in front of them. They get out of their vehicle to watch the Talliban fighters equipped with rocket launchers, machine guns, rifles, guns and grenades execute all five people in the truck. Bob (Waldemar Torenstra) starts photographing all this when he is spotted by one of the insurgents who throws a hand grenade at them that kills his girlfriend. since they are at a throwing distance, they cannot be more than 50 meters away and yet he somehow manages to escape. Her girlfriend blew up and took a picture of the moment of the impact of the grenade that kills her and wins a prize as photographer of the year for the photo. Every scene and situation in this film is as ridiculous as it is opening up. The following year Bob found himself on a mission for the National Geographic on a Dutch tourist island where he met Kathleen (Sophie Hilbrand) and entered his squalid underground world of international drug traffickers. Avoid this movie. I would give a 4.0 out of 10.
