My dear Lord, what a movie! Let's talk about the "special effects" first. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those fanatics of the effect, but I really thought the overlap was a practice from the past, mainly from the 60s. So for a while I thought they could record this movie a long time ago and it took forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they didn't have cell phones in the 60s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in movies is mostly a good story with a really good message. The acting is secondary, the effects are secondary, I don't even worry about some minor inconsistencies. However, in a film like this bad acting, the incredibility, etc. They add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me with the Celestine Prophecy. <br /> <br /> My wife said that the book was actually really good and even though I'm not in all those spiritual things I can somehow see that it can be credibly brought - the movie failed to do . <br /> <br /> There could be only one reason to look at this though. If you really like courtesy movies, it will be the right one for you. If IMDb's stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this ten-star movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse films, like "Critical Mass" (see comments on that - hilarious). Celestine's prophecy is at least funny to some extent.
