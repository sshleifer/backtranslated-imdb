Because Hollywood feels the need to redo movies that have been as brilliant as their first film (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes) but it's definitely worse because Hollywood feels the need to redo those horror movies that weren't brilliant for begin (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Very similar to their originals these remakes fail to create atmosphere, character or any real fear. The dance night is so flat and uninteresting it is difficult to watch, but for all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> It is a poorly managed, massively disinterested and ultimately boring excursion that fails in everything that is designed to do. It is clear that Hollywood Horror is dead. The Hills Have Eyes and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre also managed to ruin their franchises in style with buckets of blood and a decent storyline. The dance night is practically bloodless and I won't even say how ugly the plot is. His inability to seal the killers identifies this horror film of minor suspense from the original ... <br /> <br /> One of the most notorious 80s slasher films returns to terrify the filmmakers with this remake which only shows how terrifying high school dances really can be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) survived a terrible tragedy, but now it's time to leave the past behind and celebrate her prom. <br /> <br /> When the great evening finally arrives, Donna and her best friends get ready to enjoy the last big outbreak of high school, living it and celebrating until dawn. But while Donna is willing to look beyond her nightmares and into a brighter future, the man who thought she had escaped forever came back for a last dance. An obsessed murderer is at liberty and will kill anyone who tries to stop him from reaching his only woman. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see the day of graduation, and what will Donna do when she is forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis are the co-stars of the remake of the slasher that will see teenagers dressed in tuxedos everywhere who look nervously on their shoulders as they step out onto the dance floor. A plot that will probably discourage you by going to see this. The witch if you ask me is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much to work with, McCormick actively seeks to eliminate tension from the most trivial situations. At one point, a girl returns on a floor lamp (a lamp!) And McCormick tries to pump it in a moment of fear. Desperate times really require desperate measures. There have not been many cabinet shots since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and To Catch a Predator, there is probably a crazy and scary movie to be extracted from the commodification of glamor and the hideous and disturbing obsession of society for youthful beauty. This is not that movie. <br /> <br /> My final verdict? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will like night dancing, it's also a disappointment for those who love hack-job remakes. Considering his utter lack of blood or fear. One night you'll be in a hurry to forget.
