Eddie Murphy for the best supporting actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this movie like a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? He was acting ??? <br /> <br /> This film pales in comparison to CHICAGO or virtually any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it weren't for the great singing and performance of Jennifer Hudson, I would have given this to ZERO. <br /> <br /> And no, I've never seen the play, so I'm not doing the typical Broadway and Hollywood rap.
