When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-protagonists, you expect to find a well-made horror film, but in reality it is quite different, representing what I will describe as one of the first science fiction attempts. Karloff and Lugosi both play at the level of scientists (respectively Rukh and Benet) - competitors to a certain extent, until Rukh wins Benet with a demonstration that demonstrates his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough on the edge (so science fiction, with the emphasis on fiction) but somehow Rukh uses a kind of ray of Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million Years ago." In that prehistoric era, a huge meteorite crashed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance that scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. Much of the film is set rather tediously in Africa, searching for meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with a kind of disease that makes him a great weapon. <br /> <br /> Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi brings out a role in which he is the good guy quite well, although frankly I found him a little unconvincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story has also struggled a bit, and while it caught my attention, it didn't fascinate me. Given that this is really a science fiction movie rather than a horror movie, and that science fiction was in its early stages, I suppose the film has to be cut a little lightly. It was OK - nothing more, but nothing less. 4/10
