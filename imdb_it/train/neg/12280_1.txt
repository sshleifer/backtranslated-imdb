I saw one of the plays in Denver and I was never less impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A part of the body. Nothing shocking here. I could tell my doctor: "My left arm suffered a bit after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with the same or more social comments. It could be the "Monogram Tricep" for all the entertainment or radical commentary I heard. The monologues were boring but delivered with drama, the subjects were obsolete, and I was alternately bored and annoyed. Once I think I laughed, but apparently it was not the time I had to. Surely this is not really a success. Oh, and spoiler: there was a LESBIAN! - oh, wait, maybe not, come to think of it. And inappropriate cover-up! And a mother crack! This covers it.
