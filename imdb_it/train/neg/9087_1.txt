Canadians are too polite to whistle but the public at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater muttering that they would have voted 0 or 1 on their voting papers. The premise is that a modern director interprets a XVIIth century fairy tale about shepherds and shepherdesses set in the distant past when the Druids were the spiritual leaders. Working in three eras presents many opportunities to introduce anachronisms, including silly and impractical clothes and special spiritual rituals concerning very bad poems. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct from which disguise situations and assorted farce arise. The film could have been as exhilarating as a piece by Monty Python, which looks too close, but Rohmer's effort is reduced a lot. The audience laughed at the jokes in the sight, but otherwise complained about the slow pace. The finish comes in one go and it's really terrible. This is a trivial film and a waste of your movie.
