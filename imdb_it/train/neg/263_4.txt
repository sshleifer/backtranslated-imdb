After a day of work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The film appeared on the guide and seemed interesting, so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes was enough to interest me, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow movement of the plot made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is a merit to be given for acting in this film it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the film interesting. All in all, don't plan to impress your friends by choosing this as a charterer for a movie night.
