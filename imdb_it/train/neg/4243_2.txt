The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our saviors get their medals and plaques and whatever. So the basic idea is that the police far outnumber these gangsters from a million to one, but they are powerless because the guns of the wicked are just a little bigger. I imagine the police ammunition bounces. They decided to shoot this documentary-style film with false interviews and everything and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They are talking as if they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. Ok, I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of fire, even when the situation is so to your advantage, but don't go crazy. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I'd say it's a very long time when you've surrounded them and you're allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go to buy bigger weapons to increase their heroism. And then yes, you've got it, one of the cops really hits someone. The bullet was probably deflected by a lamppost or something. I had a good laugh, I think.
