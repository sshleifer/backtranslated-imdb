What do you expect when there is not a script to start from, and therefore nothing with which the director can work. Hayek and Farrell and Donaldson and Kirkin are good actors, they simply have nothing to say or something to react to. Even the earthquake was rather poor. And I don't know how the film closely follows the novel, but two have the Jewish girl appearing out of nowhere just to show that Arturo has a beautiful and warm heart, but some stereotypes are not equivalent to anything. And he even buries Camilla in the desert, instead of bringing it back to L.A. for a beautiful Catholic burial where he could at least bring her flowers once in a while. Pathetic. And the set L.A. was created in a ridiculous way. Something good? His apartment window looked real, the curtains, the sounds, the wind. And Donaldson is always great. It has been since the body snatchers or the night of the living dead, whatever it was.
