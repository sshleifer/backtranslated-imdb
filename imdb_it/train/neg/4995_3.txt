I found it a real task to sit in this film. The soundtrack was not the best and some accents made it difficult to understand what was being said. There was little to move the plot along and often the action simply stopped and there was a prolonged period of conversations that seemed alien to the film. These conversations exchanged between family groups and the observer were left to try to put together what was the common thread that bound them together. It is rare that you rate such a low film and I do it in this case because the whole viewing experience left me thinking "so what" and "because I lost time watching it."
