I saw this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I didn't waste money buying this. The cover of the video shows a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One. The film begins with several clips of rocket explosions, most of which are not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He changes his voice instead of letting us hear what the crew had to say. The video ends curiously with a screening of Zapruder's film. His claims about radiation, shielding, photo stars and others lead me to believe that he is extremely ignorant or that he has some sort of ax to grind against NASA, astronauts or the American in general. His science is bad, and so is this video.
