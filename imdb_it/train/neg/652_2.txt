I think it was an overrated PG-13 shit! At least the performance of BRITTANY SNOW was good and others like IDRIS ELBA were good too, but some other dance guys like lead friends weren't that convincing. The killer was so stupid and he looked so stupid too. The deaths were stupid, boring and completely unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very overrated. It was not at all suspenseful, I almost fell asleep. It's another bad PG-13 remake, it's really a terrible IMO movie. The ending was so stupid and the climax was very hasty and boring. The film is also quite slow. Overall the only positive thing about this crap fest is perhaps BRITTANY SNOW I think it gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA, but besides that it was a terrible film and a horrible remake. Well this is just my opinion. I gave a 2/10.
