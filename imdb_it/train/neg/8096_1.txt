Most of the book adaptations are bad, but this film has excluded key parts of the plot and changed the description and some characters. They rewired the plot and combined scenes and changed the order. They added ridiculous things that never happened in the book and would never have happened. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book in advance it would have been an incredibly boring film, it didn't make you worry about the characters, like them or don't like them. Turn characters into beats. <br /> <br /> Horrible. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Two-hour waste of my life.
