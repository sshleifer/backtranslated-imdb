I really can't think of some saving features of this absolutely negative rendering of Asimov compared to the art direction. Forget the disaster of product placement, Will Smith's unconvincing performance and the gigantic plot lines. This wasn't just ridiculous and painful to watch. Also the action was boring. A mixture of MTV inspired absolutely wrong production values ​​and dialogues probably intended for very young children. <br /> <br /> What a shame that the science fiction of this evil can still be made after Bladerunner, Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs to the list of the 100 below. Really terrible.
