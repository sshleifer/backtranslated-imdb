A screenwriter would be a screenwriter and his would be an agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) who come to believe he is the serial killer who is terrorizing the city, the "Killer Costume" (so named because, after injecting its victims with Windex, dresses them in stupid costumes). They convince him that his life story would be a great film and bring together a group of aspiring filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of making films can be a murder. <br /> <br /> There is more to this film but it was unfortunately left on the floor of the editing room and exhibition (the studio is said to have wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our loss (and the actors, who all do a good job and deserve better) as this has the characteristics of an exceptional black comedy, but only rises to a mediocre beauty. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ron Perlman this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comic timing is excellent and he has the chance to make great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said in the commentary on the Hellboy film that he needed an intervention when he enters Jerry Lewis mode). It's simply fun to look at in this. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-scener role (but fundamental).
