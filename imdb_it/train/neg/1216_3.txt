The genre of suspense movies really takes a dive into this. The big problem is IMPLAUSABILITY. I realize that it is necessary to create difficult situations that can cause suspense and the sense of tension that is about to happen, but this film was so predictable and not credible. I find that the more I watch this type of film, the more I keep telling things to the actors to keep them away from danger. Keeping wrong decisions is simply stupid. If they took the time to make it more realistic, I could have enjoyed it a bit. That being said, it might be better to stay away from this.
