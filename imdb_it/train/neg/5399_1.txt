SPOILERS Too often, the Shakespearean adaptations of Hollywood entertain pieces of cinema. Well shot, they are well executed and true to the text. Filagh films such as "Henry V" by Branagh and "Much Ado About Nothing" of 1993 are powerful works. Watching "Love's Labor's Lost" therefore, it is a huge disappointment for the expectation of being so horribly thrown away. Unfortunately "Love's Labour's Lost" is horrible! The king of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his friends abandoned drinking and women for three years to focus on their studies. The plans begin to collapse anyway when the enigmatic princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her entourage arrive. Soon love is in the air and philosophy is out of the mind of the prince. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, you realize that this film is not really Shakespeare. Cleverly transferred to a 1930s musical by Ken Branagh, the plot is still there and the script remains, but has now been sacrificed in favor of musical taste. Classics like "The way you look tonight", "Let's do music and dance", "I'm in Heaven" are all destroyed by a weak song and a strong feeling that they simply don't belong to us. <br /> <Apart from the weak song, we are also treated to a growing number of uncomfortable performances from normal stars. Ken Branagh and friends could have fun making this film, but they give us a series of stomach-turning roles. <br /> <br /> The top eight actors (four men and four women) are all equally terrible and the only positive for them is a big improvement over the terrible Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> In fact, only one individual leaves the film worthy of any praise and this is the ever-magnificent Nathan Lane. Lane has shown over the years that he is a genius of comedy and in this function he once again adds an air of humor to Costard the fool. <br /> <br /> There is little else to really say. "Love's Labor's Lost" deserves a bland praise for Branagh's original interpretation of an old story. Unfortunately, however, that's where the positives end. Duly acted, interpreted, sung and constructed, "Love's Labour's Lost" is perhaps the weakest Shakespearean adaptation of the last forty years. It should be avoided like the plague and should never be done. A poor and disappointing choice of Branagh and I hope his next effort is better.
