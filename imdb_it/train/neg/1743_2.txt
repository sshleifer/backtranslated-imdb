Contrary to the title, this film does not offer any spice and therefore the public is subject to a tasteless dish. All the humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani works available on video, including the mannerisms. Everyone shouts, screams and does strange things for no reason. The premise seems interesting as it is a real transition from Hollywood Boeing Boeing: John Abraham, who is so natural in almost all of his films, is a complete maladjusted here: if we keep the moral factor aside, even then the events weird seem trivial. Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced supporters strive to lift the film to be natural but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should be contrasted to bring some interesting elements but unfortunately even here all seem to be those without brains, gourmet bimbettes (3B) that speak, behave and even scream in a fairly similar way. Is that what made the protagonist keep the three girls in his own house pretending not to know each other? to do some sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Because so many dramabas without reason are not something the public will easily digest. But surely, big meat shows and tempting promises always give This is a great start. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. The sense of humor of this audience that goes to the cinema has certainly gone corrupt and insane to the extent that they are connected to a kind of sadistic, strange and maddening humor, in which the characters are not laughing, but to themselves and to just frustrations that seem so foolish that to laugh we have to put up with things like that?
