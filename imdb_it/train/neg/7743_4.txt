This film was one of the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy-based comedy and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shooting in a hip hop club. <br /> <br /> The plot is invented and there are too many side problems going on. Ford is pushing the real estate industry to the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he is having fun with chicks in his spare time, the two are being investigated by Internal Affairs, Ford is fucking the ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin) of the IA investigator and she is a psychic who has a radio show, the man who organized the murder in the club is a former cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago. <br /> <br /> Toss in the obligatory pursuits of cars and some lame attempts at humor, and this is the essence of this turkey.
