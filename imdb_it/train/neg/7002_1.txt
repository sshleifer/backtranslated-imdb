I saw this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I find this to be worse than the first. I have no idea why they made another film, it was stupid and useless to apologize if I said that I have them all. I listened to the number of times and still pushes me to turn it off for 5 minutes in the film. I like Terence Hill movies and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie just pushed me to the wall. If he had a different storyline or at least more of a plot and more comedy, it could have been more fun and was worth the $ 5 I spent buying all the movies. But you make mistakes, so I would say that you save your money and not give up this movie, or none of those who deal with it trust me on this.
