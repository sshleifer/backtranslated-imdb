Surely NOMAD has some of the best riding scenes, fencing and delightful landscape cinematography that you'll probably see, but that's not what makes a movie good. It helps but the story must shine on top of these things. And that's where Nomad wanders. <br /> <br /> The story is written, giving the feeling that it was launched together simply to make a "cool" movie that "looks" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters do not come from the region in which this story takes place (and it is obviously obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If filmmakers want to involve us in a culture like Jugar and Kazaks, they use damn actors / actresses who look like the part. <br /> <br /> Tribes at war, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our "heroes", they are all touched but with an impact and a time of viewing so low that most part of the spectators will sweep them away in favor of the next battle sequence, the next scene of the action horse, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during his filming, in particular the director and director of photography. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov and Ueli Steiger (director of photography) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the best eye since his land visions made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, switching to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not on the people, which I hear coming from Bodrov's eyes and not from Passer's. A true parody. <br /> <br /> The most shameful aspect is that this could have been a really great movie, with a focus on both character and action. Unfortunately, superiors have apparently decided that the action was the necessary one and took the cheapest route (intellectually speaking). <br /> <br /> Although I cannot give this film a positive rating, it is worth looking simply for the fantastic film work. But that's all.
