Okay ... it seems that so far, only Barman fans have commented on this film - time for a counterpoint. Attention, this rewrite is * LONG *. <br /> <br /> For those who don't know (mostly not Belgian): Tom Barman, director of this film, is the frontman of dEUS, one of the most famous rock bands of the late 90s here in Belgium. Basically, they made a couple of very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly achieved fame on a national scale. Then, the ego started to hurt me and the band practically fell apart, with Barman and another couple left to make albums under the dEUS monk. The way it always happens in these cases, the dEUS post-breakdown has been much more gentle and less interesting than the original. They tried to make an international breakthrough with their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, presenting a very diluted form of their previous songwriting style. They didn't make it. However, the ego was still quite large it seems: big enough for Barman to be considered enough artist to try movies. <br /> <br /> Very often this kind of thing is a VERY big mistake, and this is no exception. And Barman has clearly opted for * art * on this, another very big mistake. First, he's a musician, not a director. For another, dEUS at best is made fun and provocative music, but never anything like what I would consider * art *. Exhibition. <br /> <br /> So what is this film about? Basically, it tells the story of a group of people who are completely uninterested, doing equally uninteresting things during an absolutely uninteresting Friday in Antwerp, because they are also interested in things of less interest in being uninteresting. The characters are superficial, the plot totally useless and the film has no other saving qualities to compensate for these shortcomings. Humor? The whole film made me smile (slightly) about 3 times, and actually managed to cause a laugh of only 5 seconds (not strong enough). Mood? The film does not seem to show any kind of emotion or feeling. Mystery? Well, (* MINOR SPOILER *) the idea of ​​the "man-wind", which inspires the name of the film, is as compelling as a banana pepper pizza - not much, and it was made a thousand times before (someone remembers Johny Destiny - one of Tarantino's worst appearances in a film to date) (* END MINOR SPOILER *). And well, it's * artistic *, so don't expect any kind of real action to compensate for the whole previous one. In other words, with the exception of a few smiles, it bored me from my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what's left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, although it suffers from some of the same problems that other OSTs have shown lately: first, it makes the movie look like nothing more than a CD spot. Secondly, it gives the impression that Barman is trying to hide the weaknesses and lack of emotional content in the film behind the quality of the contents of the songs, which simply doesn't work. In the end, the film seems nothing more than an illustration of the songs. And unfortunately, it is the contribution of Barmans to the soundtrack that arouses more attention, even if for me it is the weakest part of the entire soundtrack. All in all, it simply shows that Barman knows more about music than about movies. Even working with the camera is fine, even if there is nothing that can make you scream with joy. <br /> <br /> The only thing about this movie that made me look was the view factor. Since I'm from Antwerp, it was fun to play a kind of "guess-the-location" game. I would hardly consider it a quality. <br /> <br /> All in all, another chance lost for the Flemish film. I continue to notice that lately the best Belgian films come from the French side of the country. This is because, at least, they have something to say and are able to tell it both in an acute and emotional way (the Daerden brothers come to mind). Perhaps Flemish art directors should also try this.
