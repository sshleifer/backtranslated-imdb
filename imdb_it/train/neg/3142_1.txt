Once upon a time there was a director named James. He brought us wonderful and electrifying science fiction like Terminator and Aliens. These films were the blockbuster hit movies and seemed to have a fantastic future ahead of him when the dawn of computer-generated special effects hit the film industry. Terminator 2 has shown us glimpses of what was possible in this new era. <br /> <br /> ....... and then it happened ................ ... 1997 ........ innumerable honors. ......... obscene amount of money ............ bizarre bizarre advertising ... ...... maximum profit margin ........ Titanic It was here! I have never been (ever) one to jump on the bandwagon and be excessively critical for the sake of it, I have often taken the opposite position from the majority only to have an ongoing discussion. Titanic was still a film of which I took only a positive single - that of Kate Winslett is absolutely gorgeous! <br /> <br /> Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more than my nephew's tree house, the images destined to terrorize were actually comical (the man fell from the ship and struck the propeller), historically false (they don't even let me start because there is too much), it had a terrible theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the useless love story was so boring, self-absorbing and pathetic to disrespect the difficulties of all the others involved (I was happy when he died and was disappointed when he didn't). <br /> <br /> Clearly it was clear that this photo was designed to attract MTV attention, chewing gum, chasing the boy with cars, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself looked like something less heroic than the erotic member of a boy band) who would have dragged their sex-hungry boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst part was that he didn't stop at that point. Millions of stupid, culture-loving people have gone to see this expensive celluloid waste because "it costs so much to produce it must be fantastic" and "Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies." <br /> <br /> The crowning glory came when the Titanic beat the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening in which his three and a half hour farce was based. It seemed to me that he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune in inaccurately portraying the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are so stupid and sentimental to buy in this type of garbage they deserve to be robbed. Good luck in Hollywood if that's how they want to make money, I'd do it if you had that kind of a chance in life! <br /> <br /> It is right there on my list of worst movies of all time with another silly, historically false / human tripe like "The Patriot" and "Pearl Harbor".
