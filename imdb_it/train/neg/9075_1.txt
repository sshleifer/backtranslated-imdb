The Slackers, as titled in this film, are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who are about to graduate from college without taking an honest exam, but who do finish it with success. This continues until the end when it's unlikely, but the most likeable character in the movie Nathan (Schwartzman) understands what they're up to. Nathan starts to blackmail again to remedy his dream girl, since he can't pursue him under normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts working on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and good-hearted Angela (James King) Unfortunately, it's not a brilliant film. Schwartzman makes watching the movie with ease, as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired just to be around with her beautiful look. The Slackers remembers American Pie with a different direction. The jokes are as low as in the American pie. But aren't they all used? I think this film is a warning to directors of the genre who are running out of originality. Overall, some smiley moments but a horrible film in terms of acting (except Schwartzman) and subject. * outside *****
