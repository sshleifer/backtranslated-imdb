I can't believe the same guy directed this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well written, if misinterpreted. <br /> <br /> This pile can't even say that. Start with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignore the narrative later describing what happened next. Following the narration correctly could have made this a good sequel in some way, but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films, not having a good draw but the name of the main villain. <br /> <br /> Even the actor who played Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you respect your tastes in movies.
