As mentioned by someone else, it starts with a bizarre prologue about a blond girl who kills a cat. Then the main story: a photographer (Gaffari) and a writer (Shepard) meet by chance and take a trip to the mountains. First they spend the night in an inn where the boss is attracted a little deaf, with growing irritation for the public, from Gaffari. Once in the mountains, they seek refuge and are invited by a kind elderly lady who seems excessively hospitable to strangers (Hansel and Gretel, anyone?). What will happen next I will go to the audacious spectator to fix up because surely I could not? t. Now, I like Eurohorror, and this would have been better if only Artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt at logical narration. The background (Pyrenees?) It is an excellent and intriguing place for mysterious and occult events. The verdant peaks could easily obscure the supernatural forces and those who command them. Photography is cute I just wish it all made sense. You can watch this movie on archive.org.
