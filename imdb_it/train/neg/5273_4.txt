*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** When I saw a preview of this film I thought it would be a slightly admirable plot. But like most of the original superstation films, I was disappointed. This naive family ends up guiding this "deserted" city to take a hold and find this video camera that shows these people that they do all their donig and discovers that they eventually disappear, the family crosses all these mysterious stages and never discovers or shows what the devil is haunting them. They are more gaps than I can count and they explain nothing of what happens or what. It ends where the family is in a car accident and becomes more laid or brainwashed or something (which is never explained). The next thing you know is that they somehow hope to find out how it all happened but it ends up leaving you completely confused.
