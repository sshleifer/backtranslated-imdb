Damn, I thought I saw some bad westerns. It cannot overcome this though. Hell I think I'd rather have your eyes pinned for a Trinity Triple Feature to cry out loud. I don't think I will be able to look at Ben Hur again without laughing at my ass. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> But hey, if you like stupid westerns with stars recognized in the thing, take a look at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as bad, but a lot more fun. 1/10
