I'm afraid I disagree with the majority. I found the latest news from Spike Lee a bit boring! Even if he was trying something different, that is not only documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I don't think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> There's a bit too much to do - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's relationship (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the mafia types local. The story is good, but in the end it's all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, couldn't Mr. Lee have added more to that side of the film? > <br /> <br /> There are still good points. All the scenes with the murderer "Son of Sam" David Berkowitz are very beautiful (color saturation etc.) and the acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall I felt that the different stories would work well on their own or without the killings. In the end it was not strong enough. <br /> <br />
