As a former submarine, this was one of the worst underwater films I've ever seen. First of all, a mutiny aboard any US naval vessel, in particular an unimaginable Trident Nuclear Powered submarine. These men are the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they have is exceptional and they take it very seriously from the Captain to the youngest crew member. I have never seen a ship's crew divide their alliance between Captain and Officer. An executive officer who acted as a character played by Denzel Washington would have been relieved of his duties and court martial, then taken to a drum by the navy. Not surprisingly, the Navy refused to send a technical consultant to help make this film. Finally, if a member of a submarine team made the amount of noise going on this ship, he would be severely reprimanded. Submarines learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. Do not slam the doors or even speak in silence and wear shoes with soft soles when they are in progress. I was amazed at how loud the crew played while it was going on. Loud music would never have been tolerated. I know that portraying underwater life really wouldn't sell movie tickets, but this is exaggerated to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
