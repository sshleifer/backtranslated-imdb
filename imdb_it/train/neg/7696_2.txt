Yes, stupidity! I finish watching and I still have a bad taste in my mouth. Too many colors, too many useless "addons" to a story, too many stupid characters (I presume they wanted to get comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... too much of everything. Shame on ruining one of the divine stories of "A Thousand and One Nights" like this one. Childish, naive (both on the wrong side) and with many mistakes that break the magic, I don't think this could keep a child of five for more than ten minutes. The princess is adorable, but she should be speechless, because the actress doesn't know how to play a role. The rest of the cast is even worse ... our "bad guy" is REALLY bad. Too bad the "good boy" is no better. Only the light in this darkness is, of course, David Carradine, who unfortunately falls below his level with this, but at least keeps his skills as an actor / "fighter" at the top. I'm still sorry to see him in such a thing, but I'm glad to have something to look at in a whole charade, so thanks David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give this 2 stars to this fiasco ... I would give more for him, but this would increase the final score for the whole film. The rest is so bad that I'd like it, maybe, but there's no grade 1 lover here and I think it would be too much.
