Way to go ace! You have just made a chilling and intriguing story of a necrophilous cannibal in a soft, soft drama. Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two types: Horror, or documentary right? This was neither of them. He wasn't close to any detailed facts, (he actually had barely any substance) He wasn't really morbid or scary or even trying to be very disturbing (like if I had to try !!) What the hell was this writer / director thinking? Here is one of the most realistic examples of serial killers who have ever been sick and we get badly shot, violent drama of homosexuals from bars and long drone flashbacks alone at his parents' house. I think Jacobson was actually trying to present (or invent) "the soft side" of j.Dahmer.
