For anyone who wants a remake of the 1989 Slaves of New York. What are there, seven of you? Here it was ... was. <br /> <br /> This undercooked film has vapidly studied characters (well, they are club boys, a great idiot!) who are in possession of patterns. The big question seems to be, how long can a young adult stay youthful? Did it take three people to write this "story"? Good God, it was easier to come with Citizen Kane. Rather than bringing viewers back, this film should just embarrass anyone who was a screenwriter in the early 1990s. The idea that a fifty-year-old woman envies a group of self-absorbed children from another era is the world as just self-absorbed, twenties could imagine it. The strange sidebar on the work of the library is not the sub-plot that is expected from the equivalent of Parker Posey's Breaker 2: Electric Bugaloo. She "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper the millstone is hysterical. Posey's shtick is always fun, but there are projects under her. I was asleep before he crossed the 40-minute mark.
