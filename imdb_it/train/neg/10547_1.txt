I don't remember a movie where I cared less about where the characters came from, what happens to them or where they are going. I realize that the biggest pastime in Hollywood is the observation of the navel, but these people are either too contemptible or too boring to occupy time. For what it's worth, however, the discussion that followed the screening, under the auspices of the Key Sunday Cinema series, made it clear that perhaps the three women showed some features of redemption. I do not agree.
