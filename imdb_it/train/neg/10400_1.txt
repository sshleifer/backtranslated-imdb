Enough enough ... sometimes it is enough to stop making films based on a concept that has long been dead. Tremors' first film was great. The second was ridiculous. The third was sickening. The television series was terrible depressing. And this film guides the mail in more depth. <br /> <br /> Basically another excuse for cheap computerized effects and puppets, now we have the series set in the Wild West, in 1800, and they fight the graboids. As a rehash of the first, they must learn how to beat them again. I guess I like it a little. Otherwise this straight-to-video version, just like Tremors 2 and 3, is going too far. Oh, and I keep wondering why no event has ever been recorded about these events ... they simply forgot to record this unprecedented event? I think that such a thing would be history, so our friends from the first movie wouldn't be so unprepared. <br /> <br /> Films like this that ruin the original drive me crazy. Avoid this garbage.
