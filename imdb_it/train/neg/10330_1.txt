Wow, here it is finally; action "film" without action. In a low-budget context (don't miss the hilarious flying discs that fly a few times) of a future Seattle we find a hard-core with no brains that seeks to avenge its childhood. <br /> <br /> There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only compared in stupidity with attempts to steal from other films, mainly "Matrix" without having the money to do it the way quite right. Yes, we can see some running on the walls and shooting in slow motion (about 45 seconds), but these scenes are as cool as the stupid attempts of the hard body to make jokes about male incompetence from time to time. <br /> <br /> And, yes, we also have a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was designed by the unpublished cast during filming. <br /> <br /> Believe me, it's as bad as possible. In reality, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can make some of you not rent it and save your money.
