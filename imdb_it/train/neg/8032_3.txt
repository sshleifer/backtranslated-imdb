This has had an exceptional cast with such famous stars as Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a group of lesser-known names but with shorter roles. He also had Technicolor, one of the few films made with it in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now the bad news ... unfortunately, I can't say very positive for the story. He portrayed the boys of James in a totally positive light ... and Hollywood has done so ever since. Because these criminals always prove themselves "good boys" is beyond me. This film fascinated them and made their enemies - the railwaymen - of vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much was absurd. Well, this is the world of cinema for you: evil is good; beauty is ugly. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: here's a flash novel - James's boys were criminals! Really - check!
