If I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I wouldn't have looked at him. It's humiliating for the Japanese, unlucky for Hollywood and embarrassing for any thinking person. But then, most of John Wayne's films are like that. Hollywood in the 1950s still believed that everyone in the world loved Americans when the truth was (and still is) a little different. The film deals with the isolationism of nineteenth-century Japan. Maybe it's Hollywood that should be isolated. To put it more concisely, this film is a lousy jingoistic claptrap (a kind of Madama Butterfly with bad music).
