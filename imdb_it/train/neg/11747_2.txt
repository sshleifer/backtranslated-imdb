Although he had a favorable press after playing at the Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were many reasons not to expect too much from this. One - it's a very low budget Canadian film. Two: it is written, directed and interpreted by the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it is Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But although I looked at him with low expectations, it still turned out to be a much bigger disappointment than I thought possible. <br /> <br /> In short - bad screenplay, bad acting, terrible direction! Don't waste your time or money on this turkey. He claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Furthermore, there is terrible music at full volume. How did it attract the attention that I will never know.
