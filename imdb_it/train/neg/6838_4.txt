Synopsis Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built the Victoria Tunnel, is murdered along with his associates by his wife. His twin sons, Chad and Alex, are divided. 25 years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, join forces to avenge the murder of their parents and claim the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time that Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sheldon Lettich have worked together, having already done "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films in which Van Damme plays dual roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The plot is a very simplistic take on the history of revenge, the only thing that redeems the film is the performance of Van Damme as two very different people ?? the talented boy and the rough, noisy cigar-poop guy. As it goes, Van Damme doesn't do a great job in either role, even though his portrayal of Alex is slightly funny. It is disconcerting to have the brothers exchanged for each other, with different clothes and different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is a worthy follower for the bad guys.
