Shamelessly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a labor of love. Unfortunately, it's not so nice. It all starts pretty well - with an epic but contained score, a Lucas and Hitchcock-style editing blend and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many science fiction polyphetical novels, series and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet of the Apes, Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film, however, fails to be as good as one of those for several reasons: the main one is that it is such a labor of love, so concerned with throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets to make a movie. There is little or nothing of tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here, despite the air battles, the dinosaurs and the battles against time. Even the noir elements fall flat. This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements fail mainly because nothing feels real at all and is so obviously fake - the green screen looks almost like a video game half the time and it is obvious that the actors were pasted later. Even the actors can't do much - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and that's all because of a terrible script - the kind that has to explain almost everything. It is a decent experience and some may have a feeling of nostalgia, but in the end it is a useless step in the world of yesterday. Nice ending though.
