Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a terrible film. It is just a superposition of scenes without a clear connection. Even the action is very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But something is really surprising in this film, talking about sexuality, women's emancipation, nude scenes are very rare in Arab cinema, even in these days. I really congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian films, but with better quality. The reasons that led me to vote for this film as terrible are not just the scenery and acting, but also the lack of professionalism. This film looks like an amateur. We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the recommended one. But if you want to encourage uncensored films throughout the Arab world, watch it and let your friends and family do the same.
