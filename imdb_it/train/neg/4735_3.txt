There is no denying that the first Azumi film was a commercial product; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had a cast of young and attractive actors and certainly not lacking in the budget department. Yet he is more than amused by what he was, and I can't deny that I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" practically lacks everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that should sound alarm bells is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he seemed to take not only his visual style and his kinetics, but his original style, beauty and, above all, his heart. While the first had a simple "hitlist" plot, this one has a chaos of a corkscrew story, with too many boring characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential of any sympathy or pathos is erased. The effective interaction between the main characters is over; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a group of grumpy teenagers arguing in a forest. The characterization is non-existent; if someone who really looks matters who lives and who dies, I will be shocked. The same goes for the bad guys here. The final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any kind of tension. The fact that they are badly choreographed and directed abysmally - not to mention a few and far from each other - is rendered a lateral line by their pure and simple uselessness. The villains themselves try too hard to be camped, and even if they were all combined, they are not in a country far from the antics of Pete Burnsian by Jo Odagiri in the original. <br /> <br /> ## ## Major Spoiler at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto does her best and must also keep her hair in good condition between the films. Azumi is now a full-fledged killer, which means she can shake the sword around in slow motion; unfortunately, now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mystery, the appearance of the Ueto model becomes even more inappropriate. I know this should be the point, but this combined with the ineffectiveness of all the others in the film, the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptitude of the film in general means that it is absolutely impossible to get behind his character this time. The least known of Chiaki "Remember me from Kill Bill" is Kuriyama's performance, better; it is enough to say that his "turning" from good to evil is as subtle as napalm. <br /> <br /> Overall, this was just a colossal disappointment. Every merit has been done ten times better in the first film. A lazy, unsatisfying, and generally boring mess.
