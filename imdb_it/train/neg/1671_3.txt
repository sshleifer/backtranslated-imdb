I saw it on the market at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> It's a real cheapo product - there's nothing wrong with that, but you have to fix it with some sex or blood or both. <br /> <br /> Think of Larry Cohen. <br /> <br /> Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for having loved her. <br /> <br /> The opening scene in the descending spaceship is exhilarating - you could imagine all the hands of the crew shaking it! <br /> <br /> Ha ha - but I wish the people who did it right - at least it's not pretentious.
