The famous Japanese director Takashi Miike does not seem able to make the wheels move with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book on an evil old woman (and pedophilia!) Which is part of a new urban legend: if your phone cell phone rings with a strange tone - and you see the message 'One Missed Call' - you will reproduce the message only to hear your last words before your death. The most successful part of the film is the incisive satire of the Reality TV cameras that intrude into future victims, but the not so elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) Are disappointing and discouraging. The frequent blows of devastated corpses are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this general kindness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. Hollywood predictably entered the unlikely 2008 plot, yet the American version didn't get better. NO STARS from ****
