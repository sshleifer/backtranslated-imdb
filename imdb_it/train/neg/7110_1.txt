Well, the director must be given credit for how brave he was. Gutsy would be the right term. Not only did he use a total cast of five people (no extras to EVERYONE), he also decided to use sub-par special effects with a confusing and boring storyline, too, and I'm NOT kidding, he put a warning at the beginning of the movie you could die DI COLD !!! However, they promise a FREE COEOFFFFFFFFFIIIIINNNNN. Having a creepy limping gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you look at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen it. They like to show off horrible films, just to let you know. <br /> <br /> A good gift for someone you hate.
