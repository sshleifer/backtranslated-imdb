Perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that every line must be followed with an insult to the people in the crowd who are not laughing. If there is someone who is insecure, he is a comedian who will not shut up about his audience. <br /> <br /> So once again, perhaps the worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that he doesn't come down from his free horse talk. If you want to be funny, just make a joke, don't explain all the reasons why you're saving the American way with failed attempts to generate laughter. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... actually ... The worst thing about Carlos Mencia's comedy is that it replaces the typical insults to ethnic groups for legitimate humor. Avoid this like the plague.
