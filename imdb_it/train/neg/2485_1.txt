There is only one use for a film like Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad the bad guy can be. We often see films that we describe as "rather horrible" or "not very good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films are not "good" they are not at all as bad smelling as bad as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds poking through the DVD shopping basket in our local hypermarket to fulfill an obligation (ie to give me a gift). It may have been a fortuitous discovery, but it was not: it is so utterly clich√©, so badly written, so misguided, so misinterpreted that I am surprised that everyone involved has not been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected it so much from about 30 seconds on, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be enjoyed. This is not one of them. It is simply bad. I stopped watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it in the trash.
