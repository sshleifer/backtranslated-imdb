I won't say that this film was bad, but it didn't work that well either. I was expecting something good but I imagine that Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much better than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this film, I was hoping somehow and what do I get? The girl is burned and her aunt's love wins. <br /> <br /> Despite being engaged, they must take leave for every little move they make. They are so shy even after so many meetings. I expected my aunt to be much more brutal than this. All he did was the madly cradle. <br /> <br /> Hey, we have children too, but we don't look at them and we always have tears in our eyes. This film is a dream. Happy family, a cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to the death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the father of the poor bride and now it is vice versa. And somehow I knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway, I think I lost time. I give him a 2/10.
