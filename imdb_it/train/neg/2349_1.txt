There was a great movie to do about Steve Biko. Unfortunately this was not the case. Denzel Washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally incapable of transmitting the great charisma that Biko has had. The scenes of the great Attenborough crowd are ridiculous. The Soweto massacre was not like that, three neat lines of children (some making wagon wheels!) Cheerfully marching in the soldiers' guns. With Biko dead the film quickly falls into the farce. If the fight against Apartheid was something, it was a struggle for blacks, yet somehow we should all be taken by the flight of a white man and his family. I'm sure Donald Woods was an honest man and he would be the first to say that Biko was important while he wasn't. Penelope Wilton's accent is pure Hampshire and she seems completely unaware of being in South Africa. at all. Wood's family dog ​​gets more lines than the black maid. While the family makes the escape, the women with whom I saw the film - incidentally one of about a dozen people of color in a big cinema full - whispered "This is like the sound of music". He had a point. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a film by a well-intentioned, albeit somewhat inept white liberal about the struggle of a radical black people. And actually South Africa needs well-intentioned white liberals as if it needed a hole in the head.
