This film was bad from the start. The only purpose of the film was that Angela wanted to get a large number of people. The acting was horrible. The killings were handled very badly. Like when Ally was locked up in that bathroom, I imagine he was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie arrives and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, see Ally so Angela must have come in to get her. The part that really struck me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and teased her. One was horrible acting and two because you didn't turn around and punched the bitch?!?!? So when Molly is chased by Angela if you have the neigh why don't you turn and stab her ??? So stupid. This movie sucked ...
