Unfortunately there was not a 0 for an evaluation otherwise I would have chosen. This film lacks the stellar power that the original film had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of the newcomer Aileen Quinn and the experienced director of the pro expert John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston) is what made this film so fascinating. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel. Before playing this film, Ashley Johnson was known for her role as little Chrissie Seaver in the early-evening show Growing Pains. He had some parts in the movies, but I don't know who thought he had enough talent to bring a movie on his own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! Weren't they able to get actors good enough to play the main roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan and Annie, but will they sign Joan Collins to play a British woman? No wonder this movie was so bad. Critics were right to disagree with this film, even though it was made only for TV, it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable film.
