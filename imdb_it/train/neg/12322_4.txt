As seems to be the general essence of these comments, the film has some incredible animations (I've seen it on Blu-ray) but it's really not up to it. <br /> <br /> First of all the characters are all pretty boring. I had the impression of a sort of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However, perhaps my mind wandered and this was wishful thinking (Laputa was my favorite anim√©, the original dub of Engilsh). The characters are not so lovely and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she adores Agito, who seems not to know about it). However she seems promptly to forgive Toola eventually without any explanation for the change of heart except that it makes the ending a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There is also a serious lack of explanations. How who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the strange women / girls who seem to go out with them and manage the forest? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how they can give normal human superpowers. Plants from the moon do not yet fill the empty spaces of this. It's almost a strange version of The Day of the Triffids. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? why bother with this if it would not be explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to love this movie, but I found the plot not as deep as a movie like Ghost in the Shell or have a real character like Miyazaki's. I don't mind looking at it but I really wish I hadn't bought it. My advice? Try it if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow or buy cheap! Maybe if you're new to animation movies and don't have much to do, you'll like it. Certainly it is visually pleasing.
