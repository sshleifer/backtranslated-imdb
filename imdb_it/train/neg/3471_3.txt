this film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was NOT seriously trying to act in any way, shape or form. He's completely sucked. Nothing in the film was credible. The first problems were in the introduction where the man gave everything to the Salvation Army, but he doesn't show why. And then the grandmother sticks her head in the oven - really beautiful, and has absolutely nothing to do with the film - it's not even in the same tone as the film. There was no explanation for Ben Affleck's motivation to choose the home he chose; there were no credible reactions from the family he chose; and people are influenced here and there without any reason to be influenced (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters sled down a steep slope - this is the incident that suddenly makes her fall in love with him. Riiight ... ) In any case, there was a funny moment or two - but they were a rarity in the film. He seriously needed another rewrite (or 4). I hope you enjoy!
