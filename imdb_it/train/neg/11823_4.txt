TOM BROWN'S SCHOOLDAYS <br /> <br /> Proportions: 1.78: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In late 19th-century England, the young Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) is sent to the Rugby public school where he experiments with the reforms of a new radical dean (Stephen Fry) and resists the school's resident bully, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already the subject of numerous film adaptations - in particular the superior 1951 version of Gordon Parry - the evergreen novel by Thomas Hughes is treated at the beginning of the 21st century, courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV "Where the Heart Is") and director David Moore (THE FORSYTE SAGA). It is quite pleasant, and watchable, but it is also quite calm and boring, distinguished only by Fry's sincere interpretation as the new principal determined to wipe out some of the most questionable "traditions" of the school, and the introduction of a possible new star in the 14 Pettyfer, a talented child with that kind of effortless charm and good looks that should take him to Hollywood and beyond. Otherwise, this is the typical UK television fodder, the type of material preferred by executives eager to fill the schedules with a "prestige" product, even an absolutely insignificant one like this. The British publication "Radio Times" described it as "slightly strange" and raised a querulous eyebrow on "all that vainglory and brutality and a handsome evil criminal who tortured life with sweet young boys". Quite.
