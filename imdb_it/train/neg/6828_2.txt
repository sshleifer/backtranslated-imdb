In a film that follows an actor in difficulty, evidently played by an actor in difficulty, this does not favor Chris Klein. He strives to bring something memorable to the role and winds through the superficial script managing to show, what could only be described as an insignificant man. History exists, but that is all, and fails to show any basic beginning, half and end and the viewer is left to shrug his shoulders feeling as if nothing in the last hour and in the three quarters had really happened. <br /> <br /> A bright light in the middle of this is Fred Durst, who manages to stand out from his seemingly medium-sized co-stars and does a semi-dignified job of bringing the character of Legde to life. If Fred can recreate this when working with a higher caliber of cast, it remains to be seen, but I'll look at it for the future.
