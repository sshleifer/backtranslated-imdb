In this extremely low budget (I saw home movies made with better production value) the absolute theft of "The Burning" and "Friday 13", a band plans to make a music video while on a houseboat. They are chased by a serial killer who was burned years before. This film is also proclaimed "the worst Australian film ever made" in its promotional material on DVD. This is just a store! Complete and total garbage in any considerable way. Maybe some giggles here and there for bad movie lovers, but it still made me want to burn my retinas. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a flash of just-non-existent tits in a lame scene. br /> <br /> My Grade: F
