This is a low budget "Scream" style movie. "Maddy" is a new worker in a nameless office, where she meets and begins a relationship with her colleague "Chris". During a pool party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that they belong to a "Murder Club" in which everyone killed someone for kicks. When Maddy loses it and kills someone for real, hijinks ensue. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and there are the requirements for this genre and budget level (nudity, cold blood, maybe a few slightly larger cameos than the cast), but after the launch of the credits, you wonder why you spent 80 minutes of your life watching it.
