This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders shows only a very limited musical spectrum of the Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings in a film that make viewing and listening absolutely boring. The only salient point of the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who became friends with J.B. Lenoir shows his private video footage and tells stories. The introduction of the filmic topic by Wenders starts quite interestingly, alluding to the culture of the world (or actually to American culture) traveling in space, but its limited looks on the subject and the reproduction is neither funny nor completely fascinating stories from the 1930s make this film a simple aid for sleeping. Yawn. I expected more from him.
