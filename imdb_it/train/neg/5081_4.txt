Was there only one positive in this film? Critics who knew nothing about video games could spot the mistakes in the game. No damage taken with clearly visible damage at the beginning is a primary example. <br /> <br /> And could I have lost something, but Super Mario Bros. 3 was not a game that had never played before? Well, if that's the case, and I haven't missed anything ... how come the Fred Savage character, and even the girl, already know a lot about the game? We're talking about things that some people don't know from their second or third play-through. <br /> <br /> Beyond the real mistakes and the game there is the low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The child wasn't even that good at playing video games in the movie he showed. Many children I knew in those days were much more experienced. On top of this the acting and the plot are just mediocre in their strengths. The characters are insipid and completely devoid of interest, the "Wizard" (the younger son) is a very silent childish clich√©, completely dry of a child who almost never speaks because of a trauma. It is not that this is not realistic, it is the fact that it was thrown into the film to even begin to form a plot that would even exceed 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the only value found here is nostalgic in nature. If you grew up with this film, you will like it if it is beautiful or not. These were kids playing video games, and by the time you saw it, you probably also had an obsession with the NES. But unless you love it as a child, there is really nothing that can interest you, and very little that will prevent you from turning it off. <br /> <br /> No sir, I didn't like it.
