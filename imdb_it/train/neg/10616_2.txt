To say. Just terrible. The script is invented, the acting is painful and the story drags on. It is, without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. It would not be so bad, but she is the director, writer and protagonist of the film, and therefore it is only self-glorification. I found myself not caring about the romantic development between the two main characters, and the ending didn't come a moment too soon. It has two saving features. First of all, many of these shots are really lovely, especially in Paris, and they look pretty good in black and white. Secondly, whether you are a tango fan or not, music is generally excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need an involuntary laugh. I'm sure he turns to someone. Statistically, he must.
