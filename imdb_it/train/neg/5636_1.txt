This film was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It doesn't seem to have a plot, but the moment you realize that this is well beyond the beginning of the film, so you have to be careful about a long time to recognize the director's total incompetence, or the sloth that plays the chick in the film, and we don't believe in Willem Dafoe in this film, it's a clone, because the real Dafoe, as we know from "apocalypse now" and "the boon dock saints", would never have accepted a script of the gender. <br /> <br /> Duh, (Da), wrote this bill closed along with his twenty years less child. This film begins with the titles of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two screenwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (the plot); The widow meets the boy, the boy slams the widow, the widow splits the windshield with the guy who slammed her. <br /> <br /> Title in the Netherlands; The black widow (different title, same bullshit). <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM !!! It's a total duration !!!
