I didn't like this movie for several reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I became extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this film was about to be saved, at least for me, that it should have pulled itself out of the huge hole it had dug. Unfortunately, this did not occur. The two projects in the film for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to be interested in what would have led to the film. Later, I felt disappointed and for all three even though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them finding their "moments" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an incredible lack of character development and uninspired dialogues. Although the plot is interesting, the film as a whole is written, directed and edited so poorly that anyone's performance as an actor would suffer and be contaminated. The disrespectful way in which they dealt with sexual abuse and the banal and offensive point of view of provincial America, I believe, were the two main reasons why this film failed to hit its brand. As one reviewer noted and I agree, the film is almost impossible to market, given its finished form. I suspect that, or at least I hope (for the actor, anyway) there are real gems on the cutting room floor. Sad for us, but if it is true then the actors can become familiar with it and feel a little good about giving their talent and time to such a flop. Oh yes and another thing ... I only wanted once I could go and see an American movie that included the sadly endangered, but wonderfully bucolic settings like the one in this movie where the main characters weren't distracted and or dirtyly scatter the countryside with pop cans, destroyed CDs and other similar waste!
