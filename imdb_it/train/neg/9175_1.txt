This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This film corresponds to the quality of films like "THEY" and "Cabin Fever", but even those have names of actors in which it has failed. The "eye candy" of this movie seemed to be a woman of 50 with a bad face lift. (just an example of quality). I would have rated this film in negative if possible. Sir, I have to tell you that men were not bad to look at, but not too much. If you are going to go see this movie, I strongly suggest you save money.
