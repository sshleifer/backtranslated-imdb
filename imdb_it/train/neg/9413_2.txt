I do not at all agree with the other spectators of this unfortunate film. The only reason I didn't judge her as bad was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda. The beginning and the end are the best parents thanks to his talent in singing and dancing. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the photo. Alice Faye comes out rather empty. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with the poor writing material, he comes out so terribly banal. <br /> <br /> The plot is really rigid here with Ameche who takes on two parts as a singer and dancer and a baron not happily married to Faye. <br /> <br /> It seems that by playing the song and dancing the man, Ameche's marriage undergoes a second change to rekindle. Some stupid nonsense about the fact that the baron needs to clear up the business and stay away allows him to play both sides. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given little to do here and therefore his comic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine. Ditto for J. Carrol Naish who looks really uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a chica chica chica bomb of a movie.
