I really have no idea why some people find the power rangers TV show even remotely interesting. The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people who play in them also seem completely silly at the same time. There is absolutely something remote about power rangers. This is just a more expensive TV commercial designed to sell extremely sweet plastic garbage to unsuspecting children around the world. From the notes, I can see that it was banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I've seen, I can agree with their decision. Avoid this show at all costs, it's terrible and ridiculous.
