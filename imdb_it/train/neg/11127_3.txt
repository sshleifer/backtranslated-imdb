I'm not sure what Diane Silver was thinking while she was making this film, but obviously it had nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel, on which the film is based. <br /> <br /> We read this past summer novel for AP English 12, and I just watched the movie. During the periodic notations and watch checking, I contemplated the possibility of being struck by lightning. Of course, the sky was completely clear, and I was forced to look at the rest of the film ... and then write an essay in 5 paragraphs. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel has dealt with very real themes of the mind of a murderer and the psychology behind it. Silver's film turned a murderer into a victim, which is NOT what Wright wanted (see: "How Bigger was Born" 454). <br /> <br /> I will make it short and sweet: if you want leave your conscience, in the words of Raffaele Lambert, spotless, skip the movie and read the book. The adaptation of 1986 is not a stimulating material. <br /> <br /> ... :: sigh :: Now I have to write the essay.
