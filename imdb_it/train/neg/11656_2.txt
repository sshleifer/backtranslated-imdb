Scary Movie 2 was a serious disappointment. The simple reference to films like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The film opens pretty well with a fun white rapper scene and an excellent use of James Woods and Andy Richter. The film rushes from there, unfortunately. The acting is terrible. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The film seems hacked together and is surprisingly slow. Some of the longer gags in this snail-paced movie, which included articulations and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise film, were not fun for anyone in my theater. The film, fortunately, stops abruptly at 83 minutes with a shockingly unpleasant ending. (I say shocking because the ending doesn't even try to end in humor) I don't know what else to say except it's a hurried sequel made to make Miramax a little more money behind stupid teenagers. Overall, a very bad film.
