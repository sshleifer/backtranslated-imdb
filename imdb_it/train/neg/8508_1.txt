It was a distressingly ugly film. It will eat your heart while you look at it. Please don't watch this movie! Hate you by losing 1.5 hours of your life! It's not like some movies that are so bad that you can see and enjoy them ... this movie is boring like ... there's nothing boring like this movie. You'll hate yourself after watching this movie until the end. And you'll hate yourself that you didn't listen to me. <br /> <br /> I hate myself. I tortured myself and watched this movie until the end. Now excuse me, I'll shoot myself. I saw everything. <br /> <br /> Please. Read carefully. Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Please!
