I thought it was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - the others are THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films speak of death. If you like to be completely depressed, then by all means watch this movie or one of the others. In this film, the acting is good and some of the landscapes (except when people are dying) are adorable. But I'm worried that a depressed person might accidentally see the movie and make himself! Despite a "happy and happy" ending, most of this film is a terrible disaster after another. And, for a crazy reason, I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED when I watch a Christmas movie (I know it sounds crazy, after all, don't you scream your eyes and feel unhappy what the holidays are anyway?) <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting viewing experience, try the forgotten HOME WITHOUT a Christmas tree, George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or a Christmas STORY instead - unless, of course, not you like to be unhappy.
