Martin Kosleck's peculiar charisma brings a certain credibility to his frustrated artist's character. He instills in his dialogue a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual. The character manages to find a real person and not a typical villain of the cinema B. <br /> <br /> The plot is nothing to write about, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. Kosleck's talkative and philosophical character contrasts with Hatton's low key monotylactic approach. The character of Creeper does not develop much beyond a level of basic monsters, but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his story. <br /> <br /> This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a boy, so I have a certain nostalgia for it. It is worth seeing once, however, for those who love horror movies from the forties.
