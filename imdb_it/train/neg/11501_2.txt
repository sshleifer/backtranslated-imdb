A romantic and completely false view of unemployment by a bourgeois "artist" with a comfortable upbringing ... It is clear that the writer-director has never directly suffered unemployment and certainly has no personal experience of it. If you were to believe this absolutely ridiculous story, the unemployed of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live during the day bringing jokes, jokes. They never seek work, doing almost never experience rejection or anguish, etc. Living with the subsidy is almost like a summer school vacation ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces like Ken Loach, etc.
