Before seeing this film I read a review that stated that this film could be one of the best films ever !? ha ha Scene after scene the tension grows ... from the boring characters in this movie. From the little girl who speaks nonsense and is trying to drown the boy, the killer who goes around without warning (and who was the boy on the beach talking to the boy !?) .. things seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film. As I watched, it looked like the film was going in one direction, then going nowhere, but in a new direction ... and so on ... <br /> <br /> Acting is great, but the writing is horrible . Every character, in every scene, says or does something so incredible, unrealistic and the reactions of the other actors / extras are simply strange. There are no resolutions to problems developed during the movie, making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time.
