I'm sure there's a sort of IMDB cult that loves movies that MST3K has made fun of. After seeing both this and "Werewolf" and having read dozens of comments on how under under, I am convinced that there is a little bit of conviction going on here. A lot of people are saying that people who hate her "are just scared of blood", "I don't know good horror" or anything like that. Well, I don't really care about blood, but I want something to happen in a movie! Most is just the wife who sits and looks around! Or stroll around the house / garden! A film requires something to give it an atmosphere, you don't understand it simply because the useless scenes have been filmed and watched. Oh, and "makes you think"? Yes, I was thinking "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> P.s. For the record, I'm a big fan of the old horror style, Dracula, Frankenstein, that kind of thing.
