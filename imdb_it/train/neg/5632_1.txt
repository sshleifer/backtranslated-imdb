I saw the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the United States) and I felt later that it was really a terrible movie. But they must have cut quite a lot of the original film, or I lost a lot. The sex scenes had little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I read many other comments on IMDb.com that mentioned vulgarity and something about a tampon. I haven't seen anything like it, just a bad boring movie with unlikely characters and a trivial and sophisticated plot. Giada Colagrande is paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills, and an expression does not touch her face. And his name makes me think of the super-sizing of a drink to Taco Bell: "I'll have the Cola Grande!" It was really fun to be so bad, I could play like I was in my Mystery Science Theater 3000, noticing things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for his face. It's really like a stupid putty!
