My hypothesis is that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see, what could it have been ... a. Would frog storms be disturbing? b. can I have someone like Tom Cruise to pronounce the word "C" many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Call my wife and have them say the word "F" every 2 seconds. Apart from that I really enjoyed the frog start and the storm. The rest was a relentless failure, too long (underemployed), overly indulgent. I'm glad that many of you had fun! <br /> <br />
