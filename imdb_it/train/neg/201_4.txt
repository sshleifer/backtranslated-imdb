Iberia is good to see on TV. But why see it on the silver screen? Much dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise an hour and a half is just too long. If you like to see dancing with skill on the silver screen, it's best to watch the Bollywood movie. They know how to combine the breathtaking dance with the long film. Director Carlos Saura knows how to start dancing from an old experience. And sometimes it looks really good. but when the film is one and the time should be at least most of the time interesting. There are many types of art, not everything is bigger than life and this film is not too big.
