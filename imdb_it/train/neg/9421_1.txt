If you enjoyed watching Mel Gibson in the Million Dollar Hotel, then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in another film so ugly that it could never be released. I can only attest to the DVD version, so maybe the VHS version is of better quality, but night movies and dark scenes have been done so badly that everything looks red. Initially I thought my DVD players were messed up. It wasn't. If you insist on watching it, I suggest you adjust the color on the TV until it is black and white. If you don't, you will never be able to pass the film. If you do, it will simply remind you of a poor film student who tries to revisit the Pulp Fiction style.
