I didn't expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what a stink. <br /> <br /> Did I find this jewel in a horrible 5 dollar DVD case at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this record was, I feel robbed. The special effects had a high school appearance, the camera was spoiled by rickety tripods and sketched lights and the acting was a perfect example of a "Christian school". One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" of the production company after seeing the returns come back - the people who financed this thing must have had seriously anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production company that put in motion this thing. Think of their anguish when they saw their $ 914.86 investment go up in smoke. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why Christian films are so bad - maybe Xian filmmakers have to watch GOOD movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Credible stories, less hysterical greetings to the arm and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to everyone, not just to true believers. That is, Stop The Sermon, Save It For Church. Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example. Excellent films with compelling stories, great cinematography and intense music. No hysterical arm. No preaching. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a laugh, it would have been MUCH better.
