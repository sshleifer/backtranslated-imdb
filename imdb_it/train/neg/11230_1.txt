In the sixth grade, every teacher had decided it would be a good idea to make this film the curriculum for an entire semester. Every lesson had something to do with this terrible show. We looked at it in English and wrote in the journals as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about graphs and other sea crap. In science we talked about whales (which was actually a bit interesting, so this wasn't a 100% waste of time). All day every day was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day making us see even in the study room. I could see if it was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93. I'm still trying to block it.
