Is this a joke? Is it a comedy? Surely it's not a serious thriller? There is no suggestion that there is anticipated humor, but on some occasions mediocre acting, bad direction and terrifying script have made the audience laugh loudly in the cinema. The plot is acceptable - a promising young artist who is reaching his peak killed by a murderer who enters by mistake. The murderer sees the work portfolio of the young artists he is bringing and decides to participate in an exhibition of his work. At the show the murderer meets the sister of dead artists and they end up falling in love. It is all very predictable stuff and in the end there will be no one who guesses why it is so misplaced. The film takes place mainly in Vienna and its surroundings, in Austria, and shows that beautiful city. Don't waste your time with this movie, unless you're studying how NOT to act, direct or write a movie!
