I recently bought the DVD, forgetting how much I hated the film version of "A Chorus Line". Any change that the director Attenborough has made to the story has failed. <br /> <br /> Making the relationship between director and Cassie so important, the whole premise of the set of musical sails outside the window. <br /> <br /> Some of the musical numbers are accelerated and hurried. The hit song of the show has the whole meaning broken when it is assigned to the character of Cassie. <br /> <br /> The stage set is very aware. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give them a 2 is because some of the big numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film's attempt to squeeze out every bit of joy and spontaneity.
