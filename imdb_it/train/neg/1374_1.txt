Friend, this was hilarious. It should be in COMEDY. O STUPID. He would have made it clear what a bunch of stanks was this was much easier. Seriously? I want anyone associated with this film to be immediately operational. For all those who think they are watching this "movie", let's move on to some points in the plot. Oh, wait. There are none. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien was bored and decided to film something with someone at random, and miraculously, somehow he went on videotape. This film is literally the worst movie of all time. You do not believe me? Go see it. Do it, man. I challenge you. But get ready to take your eyes out. If you can sit without breaking a cow, you are very strong and brave.
