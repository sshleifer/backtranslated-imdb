This short by Hal Roach, A Tough Winter, is the ninety-ninth in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Bascally a showcase for the black comedian Stepin Fetchit who receives a special billing here, we see him go to his cabin where the gang gets stuck. Farina retrieves a love letter by mail and is told by Stepin to read it because he cannot read it during the day while going to school NIGHT. It happens to be from his sweetheart in Tennesse, so now Farina must have ears full of cotton, because it's too hot for him! In another room, Weezer transmits instructions to Mary Ann to prepare the taffy from the radio but, while still running back and forth in the kitchen, he misses the presenter's steps for the rice pudding and the Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! After the trick is finished, Jackie and the rest of the gang help each other with the horrible tasty but very sticky substance, because everyone gets stuck on the walls. While everyone tries to clean the mess, Stepin works in the basement on various pipes and electrical outlets that mix functions of variable appliances like a phone that sucks, a vacuum that rings and a fridge that plays music! The end. What I just described testifies to the sinuous nature of this short film "Our Gang" which served as a pilot for a potential short series by Stepin Fetchit. It is equally true that it never took place because Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was fun only in small doses and today would be considered highly offensive. Many of the scenes I just described are good for a few laughs, even though the ending sequence was so confusing that the results were too blah for me. So, in summary, A Tough Winter is a curiosity that is worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
