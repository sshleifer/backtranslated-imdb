This moving story of hope arrives. I hope you will never have to endure anything so terrible. * cough * Razzie award * cough * <br /> <br /> I did not like this film because it was not funny, predictable and inane. As I watched I felt like I was in a psychological experiment to determine the minimum level of film standards before people complained. When I asked for my money at the end of the film, I was told that because I was looking at everything "I was not entitled to a refund". I was told by the deputy director that several people had already complained and had already received refunds. <br /> <br /> The summary of the film is quite simple. The dwarf thief steals a diamond and poses as a child to evade the police. Below this skillful profile, however, there is a repertoire of original scenes, fresh and fun. Or not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people being hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see dwarves posing like babies threatened by a thermometer in their anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think children say "goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa"? Do you drool? <br /> <br /> If you answered "yes" to one of the previous ones, this film is definitely for you. Although it has been advertised in some places as "The worst movie of the decade", there is probably a movie or two that are worse ... somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this film 2 stars because we all know that a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and therefore the review would not have been taken seriously. <br /> <br /> This lowbrow comedy is designed for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something fun. <br /> <br /> Respect
