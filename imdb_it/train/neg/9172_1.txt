When I go to see a film about zombies, I don't expect an Oscar-sized performance, nor do I write at the level of The Godfather, but I expect that the actors don't seem at least like trying to read their cues and talk doesn't seem to have been typed 10 minutes before the actor reads it in the camera. This movie was just awful, in fact I got up and left for about 25 minutes and went to the next door and watched Cold Creek Manor, which wasn't very nice, but it looked like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of shit. The positive side is that the girls were very nice, probably the only thing that kept me in my seat longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest one was killed, there was nothing that could hold my interest after that.
