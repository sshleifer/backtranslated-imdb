I know that nobody cares, but I do. This film is historical for a reason. It is the union of two heroes of two science fiction films of the 70s. Well, one is big, and one is pretty bad. The big one is really big, in fact it's the best. The bad one is really bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course the great I refer to "Star Wars" and the star Mark Hamill, aka "Luke Skywalker", who is the hero of this film about a boy who gets his Vette and then goes to Las Vegas (on a leash) and after a lot of adventures, he finally recovers it. (Since he is in charge of repairing the cars, I imagine you could call it "Lube Skywalker"). Along the way he meets a prostitute with a heart of gold, and ends up facing a character played by Kim Milford, the hero of the science fiction film of the seventies "Laserblast", which is, as I mentioned earlier, the worst movie science fiction ever made. Milford plays the role of the villain Hamill must steal his car from. I realize that nobody cares about this meeting of two great science fiction heroes, but I do. And I must also say that this is one of the best / worst films of all time. Mark Hamill's acting needs strength, the plot needs a long Jedi training and the prostitute character played by Annie Potts could be the most annoying character of all time, in any movie I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a weekday night, late at night, very late. It is one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without finding it yet, at the same time, the whole purpose is, like free-form jazz, simply to exist as it is. And it does. And what it is, it's not fantastic, but you can't say it's not funny, because for an hour and a half you may feel ripped off, but you won't feel cheated. So turn off your mind, relax and enjoy this fuzzy gem with no expectations and strength to always be with you.
