Thanks Hollywood. Yet another classic of cinema completely ruined by an economic, superficial, heavy and redundant remake. The original "Planet of the Apes" was an intelligent and inspiring film with a very clear message. It was a film that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very boring but was actually very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, seems to have eliminated almost all dialogues. Instead of a great movie, we get a stupid two-hour tracking movie. Dialogue has been minimized, interaction between characters and development is non-existent and most of the time it is extremely difficult to understand what is happening. Instead, we get a lot of useless action scenes, some marginal jokes and some almost intelligent conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing worth mentioning in this film is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The monkeys make-up is magnificent, and even the sets and backgrounds are beautiful. However, this does not detract from the fact that "Planet of the Apes (2001)" is a very superficial and simplistic film, full of very thin characters, stupid dialogues and an almost non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining the big movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the ending has made NO SENSE. <br /> <br /> * of **** stars, mainly for graphics <br /> <br />
