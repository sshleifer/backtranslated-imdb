First of all, I would like to say that user comments have left me with only tears in my eyes to laugh. A comment on the fact that bad science fiction films become good comedies is right. MST3000 made sure it survived. <br /> <br /> If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10-year 1959 comic book reader, you'll have control over this loafer. All the elements are there: pseudoscience, sometimes logical, more often hilariously childish. The attitude of the adolescent boy towards sex, with the captain of the "gigol√≤" (good talk about that, boys!) Who makes the amazing "scientist" look so red-haired is a wonder that does not trigger fire alarms . The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so foreign that everything turns red, yet an alien monster has a rat-like face, and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a toy for children. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who seems to have never finished eighth grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. And, of course, the simple fact that alien = dangerously evil. If these people had met E.T., they would have roasted it in two main courses! "OW" really! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I voted for this low movie. However, it is never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - just to make it more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit that, in your core as a kid, it makes you jump a few times. <br /> <br /> Ok, then don't admit it. I guess you never had 10 years.
