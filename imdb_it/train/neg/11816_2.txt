Getting lost in frozen space for 15 years is unlikely. Fall into a star ... unlikely. Falling into it the day that passes the supernova and explodes ... ridiculous. To be saved by a ship only then ... priceless. <br /> <br /> No, it is not the heart of Gold of Zaphod Beeblebrox to the rescue. He is not even the winner of a parent of the year. After condemning her daughter to two years of isolation in an abandoned spaceship, her mother encourages her to get drunk and walk away alone with the strange man they collected. This foreshadows their value in hand-to-hand combat, which constitutes most of the film's action. The highlights of the fight include, for example, the psychopath who talks closely with a woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at about six inches away, which nicely pleases in the line of fire. <br /> <br /> In the end, the family of three abandons the metropolitan-sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the very last moment because it is too slow to escape the explosion, using the ship instead psycho combat that fueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of propellant gas from a 0.7 kiloton missile. You must love those hard-sci-fi stats! <br /> <br /> As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill, they will continue to produce films not suitable for shooting at 3 am on the Sci fi channel.
