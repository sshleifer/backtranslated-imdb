Nothing can prepare you for another bad baby adventure! This time, you're offered by the invincible Fred Olen Ray! As for the exploit films, this one doesn't click! As science fiction, it's simple, not original! All we see is an ugly female android wearing a bikini to destroy the Earth and show all that is almost bare to resist! Give me a fucking break !!! If this kind of entertainment is your passion, then why not dust off those old SI swimsuits from the attic for a change ?! It would have been much better if he hadn't set the Sleaze factor to very high, but that wouldn't have made him exceptional. I would like to highlight another film entitled THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which recalls the identity of ALIENATOR. It illustrates why top quality "femme fatale" action films do not translate well into America. Sorry, guys!
