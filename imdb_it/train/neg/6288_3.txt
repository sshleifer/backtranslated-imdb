Having read many of the comments here, I'm surprised no one recognized it as a remake of a 1960s Twilight Zone episode called "Mirror Image" starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective ghostly tale in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis in 88 minutes with this boring nap. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a film, there should be a little more substance and the story should make sense. Unfortunately, the substance and the meaning are two things that are missing in "The Broken". Yes, it has a few moments, but it's not enough to justify your time. Some further observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the film has a cell phone! And even if a car accident is the event that keeps the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, the person driving the other car, or the police who would have been required to make a report . My advice: skip this boredom and look at the original instead!
