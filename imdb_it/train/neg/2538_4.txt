Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox made a ton of Mr. Moto's films. However, towards the end of the series, it was obvious that the study had "skipped the shark", so to speak. This phrase indicates that a television program has surpassed its first and managers have decided to reinvigorate the show by radically changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they introduced the boring "Cousin Oliver" and with "Family Ties" they introduced a strange child who grew six years in one season! With the Moto films, they had skipped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films should be reworked. In the previous film, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And in this film the character Archibald Featherstone appears. Featherstone could be just one of the most boring examples of comic relief ever, since you kept hoping someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him up !! Although he should work for the famous Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and insight of a brain-damaged turnip. Again and again, his scenes were rough and useless and Peter Lorre seems to be only saddened while he is there and observes this funny "act". It's so serious that it really destroys what COULD was one of the best Moto movies thanks to its clever storyline. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, the crown of the Queen of Saba was discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was, is available to protect the precious object from being stolen. In a big turning point, many thieves try to steal the crown independently of each other. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is watchable but it's also ample proof that the Moto series should have ended here. With the approach of World War II, the films could not have survived much longer, because having a nice Japanese leader would not have been accepted in the United States or in allied countries.
