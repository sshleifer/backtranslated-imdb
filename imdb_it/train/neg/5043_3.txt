I'm a big fan of Ziyi Zhang and I'll go to any movie to see it, which is what brought me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted this film, I agree with many others who have commented on this film. He is very confused and also extremely slow. Since the whole film seems to have been shot with a hand-held camera, significant parts of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The film has very little dialogue and what is there does not tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other without talking. The way in which the film's time changes is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Although I had read a number of reviews before and had a general idea of ​​what the film was, I still had difficulty understanding what was happening. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film was not remotely similar to Ziyi Zhang's previous films, but I couldn't wait to see it in something different, but unfortunately I was disappointed in the end. He never smiles in this film, even though most of the time he has nothing to smile about. I could have done without sex scenes because they had no sex and no obvious feeling among the participants, as you could have hoped to find.
