I'll start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything was great, the costumes, the music, the lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), the choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and the culinary scene. <br /> <br /> But that's all. <br /> <br /> I understood, artistic cinema, blablabla, but too much is too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of listening and complaining from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was!), too many pornographic scenes (I really understand it, I realized they were filming a porn movie there, but really, really, it's really too much) I really think that cinema should be to watch and this is absolutely not watchable in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
