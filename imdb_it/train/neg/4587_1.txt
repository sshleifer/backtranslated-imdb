Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What Bleep do Know has achieved almost impossible - leaving behind these masterpieces like" The Postman "," The Dungeon Master "," Merlin ", and so on, will pass to history as the single worst movie I've ever seen in its entirety. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is really impressive, because I've seen a lot of bad movies. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema is made up of two intertwined parts, alternating between a stupid and forced plot on an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take antidepressants to survive, and a group of talking heads that explain how quantum physics can justify their new pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if you start your day meditating with characters like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd of people who know how to have fun and a considerable portion of good grass, then this film is also for you. Otherwise, stay away. Believe me on the word. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about "What the Bleep do you know" is that it seems to have been modified and assembled by the same type of people who run cheap camera weddings, complete with pink heart effects , computer-generated sparks on the screen and other assorted nonsense. Who allowed these people to approach a theatrical version is a mystery to me. I imagine this is what Kenny G does to you too. The film was permeated with GCI cheese, the ones you or I can produce on our computer through bench-top video editing software, but never, because it's just too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> the script was _provoked_ written by someone without any writing experience. Not only were all the characters and conversations cumbersome and invented beyond imagination, but the "writers" felt as if they had to push any relevant information, or rather disinformation, which is most of this film, all your way through your gluttony Well, given the target audience, it may not have been a bad idea. The main character, for example, spends half of the pills to burst in the cinema. Apparently, however, it was judged to be not sufficiently convincing, so there are at least a couple of dialogues in all, which refer specifically to his anti-anxiety pills, in case the spectators should not be able to connect his pain and the suffering overwhelmed with small white pills that he takes whenever he feels down. Acting ... Well, I've seen better acting in Ed Wood's films, and no, this is not an exaggeration. Heck, the little game I performed when I was 12 was playing a much more challenging acting than that. The story was interrupted here and there with a group of talking or casual heads, a strange mixture of kooky scientists, kooky doctors and self-proclaimed mystics, who go on and on about how physics is supposed to provide an "explanation" for why the man or woman has created their own reality simply by participating in the experience of life. Reality, you see, is a probability field of a bunch of different possibilities, and it's only carved in stone once the Observer has chosen to notice it. What happens when more than one observer observes that they have not said, but then again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and you will be God, and nobody cares about these silly and archaic things like critical thinking, logic, etc. All reasons are immediately rejected because people are stuck in their ways and unable to make a "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". Moreover, the Heidelberg uncertainty principle is presumably a positive proof of alternative realities, parallel universes and so. <br /> <br /> Speaking of rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the film. All these people keep talking about cutting down the rabbit holes. I'm not sure what this had to do with whatever they were saying or showing, but one thing I'm sure of is that it somehow involves anal sex. In reality, the film is extremely anti-sex. In any case, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. <br /> <br /> In any case, speaking the talking heads, the main character achieves harmony and illumination by painting hearts all over the body with a magic marker, and proceeds to walk with an even more stupid look in his glazed eyes that he didn't start with. <br /> <br /> I want back 2 hours of my life. <br /> <br /> Here are a couple of random quotes that I happened to remember: <br /> <br /> "What I think unreal has become much more real to me, and that, which I considered real, is often much less real than unreal. " - Some talk about the spirituality of quantum physics. <br /> <br /> "What does it take to get an erection for a man? It just requires a thought. Nothing changes on the outside, all the changes are inside. Yet it has an erection" - Some self proclaimed mystics, at the head of his own lighting school. <br /> <br /> [while looking at themselves in the mirror] "I hate you, I hate you! Fat! You are ugly! I have you!" - main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
