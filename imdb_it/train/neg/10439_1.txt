I'd like to consider myself a pretty open guy and it takes a lot (!) Not to love a movie, but this is without doubt one of the most disgusting and deceptive movies I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what's wrong with the people who have given such good marks here (imdb is usually quite reliable when it comes to evaluations) ... the only thing I can imagine is that people must have voted during one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. Despite being drunk / stoned by their minds 2. They received hard cash for the votes 3. Under armed fire <br /> <br /> I can't believe I wasted a good 1 hour and 45 minutes of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.
