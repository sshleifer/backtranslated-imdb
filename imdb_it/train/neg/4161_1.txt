A stuttering plot, uninteresting characters and sub-par dialogues (to say the least) afflict this television production that would hardly have been interesting even with a production budget of a billion dollars. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible in their motivations, actions or professions professed. The plot reads like a bad attack by Dungeons and Dragons (TM) but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious problems of continuity and the degree of useless interaction between the characters has this author, at least, a grimace. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. Watch any episode of Dark Angel and you'll have a better acting, dialogue and storyline. How disgusting.
