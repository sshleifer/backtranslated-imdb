I have a copy on VHS, I think (TV networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So that we do not forget what it was and that we remember not to repeat the same mistakes. How to put some people in the director's chair, where they don't belong. This film Rappin 'is like a Vaudevillian musical, for those who can't sing or act. This film is as much fun as trying to teach the "blind" to drive a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) has just been released from prison and returned to the old neighborhood. In serving time for an all-to-pleasant crime of necessity, of course. John returns to the old road and is greeted by old dogs and old housemates as they dance and sing all the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it if you were sentimental, or if someone was actually smoking a medicine jar prescribed by a glaucoma doctor. In both cases it is a poorly directed, scripted, acted and even produced (I never thought I'd sat down) satire of the life of the ghetto with the "hood". Although, I think the redemptive part of the story, through the sequences of fighters of the aspirant band and dance numbers, his friends worry about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being demolished and cleaned up. <br /> <br /> Forget Sonny's spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for this compared to this Rap. Oh well, if you find yourself wanting to laugh at yourself and embarrassed at three quarters, make sure you drink first. <br /> <br /> And please, look responsibly. (No star, better luck next time!)
