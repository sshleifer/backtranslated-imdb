Some say that Steve Irwin's antics and Steve Irwin's gregarious personality are just an act. Watch this movie: it's obvious that you can't act. <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, dangerman star of the small screen in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries *, * Croc Files * and eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * series (you see a naming tendency here, or is it just me?) , launches his character bigger than that of the conflict with * Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course * (yes, there is a definite trend of words that start with 'C') - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * mashed along with a B-Movie. <br /> <br /> On a mission to transfer a large croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer (Magda Szubanski), Steve and his wife Terri ignore that the crocodile is located by American spies (Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom), out to recover a spy satellite light that he swallowed. Will it hurt my credibility to say "I'm on a collision course with Wackiness"? (what credibility? - note Ed.) <br /> <br /> The plot is irrelevant, as it is Steve's animal magnetism that drives the film. If you find that his person tries, the film is a failure, but if you are a fan of him (like a businessman, conservative or simply ass-klown) or his television programs, you expect more or less the same on a large screen budget. <br /> <br /> John Stainton, faithful lord, best friend and host of the Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * (can you say that with a serious face?), writes and directs with the same provincial bravado that made Steve a home wildlife jester. <br /> <br /> The most shocking aspect of this film is that of Steve (one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation marks as he talks) and Terri (Steve's 10-year-old spouse, ally fiercer and closer friend) treat it as if it were one of their documentaries, breaking the "fourth wall" and talking directly to the camera, while all the other characters behave as if they were in a bad movie (well ??). Wouldn't it be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept apart from the rest of the characters? but when the bad Americans constantly threaten Steve's life, we confused onlookers must ask ourselves why the indifferent television crew does not at least call the police if it does not try to hit the bad guys with the boom microphones, or throw screams in the bush ?? all but continuing to film casually with great lighting, clear sound and seven angles of action. <br /> <br /> While Terri is unfairly depicted as Steve's slightly incompetent assistant (his acting consists of bold readings lurking in tight pear-shaped buttock-shaped jeans - for the last time, not I complain), Steve does his business as usual to show and tell with creatures intent on killing him, doing all his stunts because, well, for him they are not really stunts, just a day at the office. <br /> <br /> Of course, looking at the adventures of this crazy koo-koo after his tragic death in September 2006, a strange detachment from the trial. But for those of us who have never met him, this type of malarkey (as well as various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter series in constant repetition) keeps him alive more than ever in our crocodile dens. The harrowing reality of his absence will be evident only to those closest to him. And do I really wish them the best in following his oversized imprints ?? <br /> <br /> So enjoy this diversion for what it is ?? a half-cooked film with a complete legend. Did he die doing what he loved ?? interacting with nature - and he could never ask for more of his first feature film in considering it to do just that. <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)
