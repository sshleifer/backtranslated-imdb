I liked the original story, I had very high expectations for the film (especially since Barker talked about it with enthusiasm in interviews), I finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! The direction is everywhere, the acting was atrocious, the flashy images and the choreography were simply flat, empty and completely superfluous (how to say with the generic techniques of music videos such as nonsense fast forward and slow? Is not necessary in this film and reduced the atmosphere to some stupid MTV videos Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo). While some of the killings are quite beautiful and brutal, some are simply ridiculously ridiculous (the first killing of the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi's death was simply stupidly funny). He rushes everywhere with zero tension and suspense, moving away completely from the original story and then returning to it in the final that at that point feels stuck to ruin even more. No explanations were given of any kind, I mean, I knew what was happening only if I had read the story but for the people who hadn't even more confused since sometimes I didn't even know where he was going and what he was trying to do- a crazy bribe was happening all the time. <br /> <br /> God, I really wanted this movie so much because I'm a big fan of Barker's work and I loved the story because it has a huge potential for a cracking movie, I even enjoyed some of Kitamura's movies as fun romps, but this movie has only exhausted me of amateurism and nonsense from beginning to end. I didn't care about anything or anyone, everything was hurried and severely reduced to its true source, turning it into something else entirely. Assuming it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb fool, but everything else was everywhere, more than disappointing. eviscerated
