Loaded with excellent actors, I expected much more from "Deceiver" than it had been delivered. The plot is extremely artificial and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add confusion. Credibility flies out of the window and with the finish it becomes unbearable and definitely ridiculous. I highly recommend to all those who like their film plots based on something that is at least possible to avoid "Deceiver" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I'm not fashionable enough to have it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the plot and especially by the ending. The blurring of the line between reality and lies does not work because the whole film makes no sense. - MERK
