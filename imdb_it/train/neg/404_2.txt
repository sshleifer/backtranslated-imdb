Shortly after seeing this film I questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress who accepted a role. Elizabeth Shue is a commendable actress, why embrace such an overvalued opportunity? I have to give credit to those who owe the credit, though. Some moments of the film were unpredictable and rather penetrating, but they could not compensate for the fearful perverse tendencies of Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine. I would not recommend this film to anyone, man or woman, who has any form of self-respect.
