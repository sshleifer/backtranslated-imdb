Overall this film is terrible and should never have been made. One of the problems with this film is that there is no connection with the public and the characters, for example, if it is going to be attacked, you want to try "Oh my God, no!" there is no connection made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed that the film would be great, yet there is no suspense about what it really is. Maybe there was a bit of mystery, but it's not there. "All he has is a toolbox." it was said on the back of the DVD, you would think that this film was planned carefully and that it was done intelligently, but it is not so, the ending was simply horrible, very simple and useless. The acting is average or below average, perhaps even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. Even the "special effects" and sets were average, nothing special like never. There is not much blood, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This film was advertised to make it really surprising, but in reality it is not even worth looking for it, I don't recommend it to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied by some clashes and a boring story.
