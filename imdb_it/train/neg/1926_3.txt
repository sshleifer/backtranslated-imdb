Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to judge this version of Dr. Seuss' classic story, and well ... it's not very nice. First of all, following a classic act like Chuck Jones's animated TV special will be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy that it seems really insensitive. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film looks like a calculated cash out at the same time it is supposed to denounce the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically exaggerated, but he completely disagrees with the Grinch character. As characterized by Boris Karloff, it was a slow burn; methodical and clever. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and this is just the most obvious mistake made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, universal, why? I mean, I understand that Tony Hopkins will have virtually any role offered (very similar to his compatriot Michael Caine), but this must be filed under "Films that should never have been made". This does not bode well for Cat in the Hat, an even thinner volume that Universal is preparing for this Christmas. I have the feeling that I will make the same recommendation for what I am with this: jump, and read the book or watch the special TV. 2 hours you can never, never go back.
