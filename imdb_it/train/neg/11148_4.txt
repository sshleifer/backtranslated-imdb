This is the first example of a low budget, winning on what would be a good plot. We report Samaire Armstrong (having seen his work on OC I know he can do better), then find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad, and mostly badly generated by the computer, that it almost lost me the first time the wolf was seen on the screen. And Samaire Armstrong (watch out!) Transformed into a werewolf has been made by reducing it to a bad GCIF figure before it even starts to change (the humans of Final Fantasy, like those of Pixar made them ridiculous, think of figure like Barbie naked Doll). <br /> <br /> The story of it was interesting, although the idea of ​​the werewolf's bloodline is nothing new. Since it is also poised between evil, (perhaps) not so bad, and the possible end of mankind should the two lines mate. The subplot of a "werewolf book" that had influenced some of the other characters in a magical way for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Present a best script and direction and I will come back again.
