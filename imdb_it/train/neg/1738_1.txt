This miserable film is a remake of a 1927 movie. They should have let it stay that way. <br /> <br /> What a colossal bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subjected to a role as a real fool and Bette Grable sings with a choir - What will I do to that Hungarian! <br /> <br /> The ridiculous plot deals with an image of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now we go on 300 years later, where Grable, just married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation, when on the night of the wedding, there is an invasion of Hungarian soldiers. <br /> <br /> Romero acts as a coward and flees before the army arrives. He dresses up as a gypsy and is forced to stay at the castle when his violin sounds good to Fairbanks. The finale is worse than the miserable movie when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - an infuriated Romero has canceled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a film was made in 1948. Like Harry Davenport, a veteran support player who is in it, he died in 1949; this must have been his last film. What a bomb to go out with after such an illustrious career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel is a co-star, but he can do little with such poor writing. The costumes seem more like those that would have come out of the stone age. I can't understand what Fairbanks wore.
