THE CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher apparently produced as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say "alleged" because the film's title doesn't have the "V" in brackets to indicate that it was a DVD movie (even though it looks like one). <br /> <br /> Is the plot simple? a band is holding a concert in a former meat factory and they are killed one by one. <br /> <br /> I think most would agree that the film would never be a masterpiece, but that doesn't justify the flaws here. Even straight-to-DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have many redeeming qualities and sometimes present themselves as one of the so-called "so bad, good" movies. However, THE CHOKE is certainly not a serious slasher (like HALLOWEEN) or a "so bad is good" film (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The film starts well with a character killed with a drill. The effects of blood were very approximate but understandable given the very low budget. But from then on it's all downhill. <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes in THE CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about it. But, some obvious stand out and I will address them. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned concert holds the group seems to start with about 50 people present but after the music has stopped, it seems there are only about 8 people left (yet they are all destined to be blocked !). <br /> <br /> The characters in this film are not at all nice. Most of the band members are aggressive and idiotic idiots or simply bizarre. Nobody really cares what happens to them and even their supposed friends forget about them when they were sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to consider the wrapping factory as a kind of church (seriously!). It makes some really fun lines for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, even his presence cannot save the film. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of people walking and talking without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the film are spent watching the characters speak. The characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation. As in other straight-to-DVD movies like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time swearing aggressively at each other without any provocation. There are a lot of exaggerated explosions (mainly from male characters) and one almost translates into full-scale combat. In fact, we can say that the format is the following: the characters walk - the murder takes place - the characters go around - the murder takes place. The idea came to you. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the use of the word f. Maybe this was supposed to be fun, but it's sad. And more precisely, we have seen all this done a thousand times before (usually with a much greater effect). <br /> <br /> The film is totally devoid of suspense. The corpses are used to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger. A maniac is unleashing, yet the characters behave like morons. They make a small attempt to leave the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves against. And most of the time, they don't even pretend to be scared. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the murderer is not seen when the murders are committed (with the exception of the final murder when the identity of the killer is revealed). A random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question. There is no one seen chasing characters at any time. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this served to make the movie fun (unintentionally of course), but here is not at all funny. <br /> <br /> And, as another reviewer pointed out, the soundtrack includes music that is bad, even for those who love punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable to dance. The score (in the end, there is no music at the beginning!) It consists of a band of aspiring Sugarbabe who sings a very bad song that has nothing to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. This review likes bad movies (like THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But it seems that THE CHOKE has tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without entering into either of them. And even if straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a bad effort. <br /> <br /> The film contains some pretty good murder scenes. But when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of traditional B-movie slashers from the 1980s should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH should do everything in their power to avoid it!
