I'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting, but everything about this film seems and seems cheap and fake. <br /> <br /> After seeing Der Untergang this is a huge disappointment. There is no connection between the different scenes, and the acting is so incredibly poor that I couldn't even believe that people could create such a mess of something that had great potential. <br /> <br /> And above all, everyone in Germany speaks English. Big mistake. The German language has a certain sound, and in particular Hitler himself sounds like Hitler when he speaks / shouts German. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told made me believe that it was improvised on the spot, the characters were empty and the film seems to be a collection of random events that may have happened. <br /> <br /> Whether it is English or the fact that I have already seen Der Untergang, everything about this film was false and ridiculous.
