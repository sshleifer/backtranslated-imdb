I will try to use words to describe it on .... <br /> <br /> I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but at the time I should have feared a sequel. <br /> <br /> And I was "scared" when I chose this, but now that I've seen it, I have to say, it's even worse than I thought. Because these films still get money they make my head spin. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the actors, they are not that good, but it must be said, some make your head spin to be simply horrible. But what can an actor do with a script like this. It is trying to be a copy of the original only that this time the places have changed, any form of history has disappeared and any attempt to invent something that has never been done before, fails miserably. In a futile attempt to update it, they try to make it exciting by exploiting the whole theme of the "big brother", but which was consumed centuries ago and offers nothing but a filling between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the film by making a lot of references to the '83 original, but in the end it was simply fun and sometimes a little sad. In conclusion, if you have nothing, and I mean nothing, to do ... go and see it, or play Frisbee ... with the DVD ... alone. It will offer you the same amount of fun .. I promise
