I lost time and gave this show a chance. This must be one of the worst new shows. If they gave a prize to the shows they suck THIS should sweep the category. The acting is poor and the plot is invented. Now the dinosaurs were a bit weird but at least it was fun. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped off. This new show, based on commercials from insurance companies, is not fun and actually has nothing to do. Perhaps the original commercials and the number of times they have been, and still are, repeated is what is wrong with this show. He has just arrived on TV and we are already tired of seeing the "caveman" characters.
