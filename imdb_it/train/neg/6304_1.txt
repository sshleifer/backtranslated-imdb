As a naval history buff from World War II, and someone who is not proud of the history of race relations in this country, I couldn't wait to see this film. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I did it at about 3/4, but I should have turned it off in the secondary attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would fire a torpedo in a DDE, as if there was a hope of hitting it, and therefore being able to "escape" from the DDE while it was submerged, is absurd. And this is just a small detail. The whole film was poorly written, badly directed and badly performed. I agree with others on this forum that this may have been a good movie. It is as if they had decided that, since all those lousy WWII propaganda films had been made with completely white casts, they needed to make one with the blacks. And as bad as those old movies, this is actually worse. And it almost sucks of false advertising to name Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they played very minor roles. I have to believe that those two good actors were embarrassed to be associated with this movie. I finished. I gave up too much of my life on this shitty movie.
