This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the pathetic script and the biggest question is how this rather low script got it through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies, from the deep dramas to the more masculine ones, they kill everything you see kind of movies, so I can't say I'm fussy. I struggled to find something to compare it to, but I can't think of anything that matches this, maybe a starship 2. Witch in my opinion makes the gods of cinema cry and I think of throwing out my DVD player, but respect its effects are fantastic. Superb acting and script should be rewarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well, people aren't one of those that kill your soul minute by minute.
