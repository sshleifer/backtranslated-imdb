When it comes to horror films, I am more than willing to suspend disbelief, to ignore partial production values ​​and to ignore plot holes in the interest of good fear. This film simply has no good scares to offer. It cannot even be appreciated as a field. Bad dialogues, bad acting, bad direction, the killings were predictable and badly set up, the music was annoying, the work with the camera was miserable, even the costumes were bad. I felt really bad for the actors, who obviously were rehearsing, but who were dealing with a terrible and forced dialogue and a clear lack of direction. I doubt they even did tests. It is embarrassing to look at, and so boring that going to the end of "invented" surprise requires great endurance. It's quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I don't usually write reviews, but this one was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This film is a complete waste of time. If you have to watch this movie, don't miss the "Making of" -featurette. The writer / director seems to have the impression that making a killer a woman is a kind of bold, daring move. (See.) He and the cast spend half an hour deconstructing this film as if it were a new-age "Citizen Kane". It's like listening to a group of third grade students taking you behind the scenes of their Christmas contest. They really think they have created something of substance. Is it sad, really ?? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities, like "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I should say it's somewhere in the lower fifty.
