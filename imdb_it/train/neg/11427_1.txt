I don't know who Sue Kramer, the director of this film, is, but I strongly suspect that A) is a lesbian and B) has somehow shamed all those involved in this project to participate in proving they are not homophobic. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that everyone thinks: "My God, this is horrible, not funny, pedestrian, totally lame". But keeping their mouths shut out of fear will be labeled as anti-gay or "not get" the gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT throw homosexuals to play homosexuals too). However, it is not even worth reviewing. The actors are all directed to reproduce every scene completely over the top, so there is no sincerity or credibility in everything they do. It's full of clich√©s and there's nothing in this film that is the least fun - much less fun. I hated it and I'm not afraid to say it. Too bad the unscrupulous people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb were not so impartial in their judgment.
