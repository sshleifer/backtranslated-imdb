Until today, when you talk about Japanese cinema, most people don't talk about Rashomon, or the Seven Ronin, or the Rans. For the masses, Japanese cinema means all those monsters we've learned to love by destroying those Japanese cities over and over again, many times in battles between them. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla who has returned a dozen times or more and in some films has confronted the three-headed hydra monster similar to outer space, Ghidrah. <br /> <br /> Oddly in harmony with the times, the special effects have improved slightly. But part of the charm of those old movies was seeing those paper and paper sets destroyed, they seemed so fake, maybe three steps above Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some visitors to the future traveled to Japan to urge that Godzilla will be destroyed when it was first discovered. And in fact it was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II, when it protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific island from those American troops. But later with the atomic tests on Bikini, Godzilla, the cute dinosaur, just like Barney, became the bad machine we learned about in the cinema. <br /> <br /> Obviously you eliminate Godzilla rather than give Ghidrah a clear field to destroy Japan so that it does not become the economic giant of 1991 when the film came out. I will not say more, but we all know that Japan is doing quite well as in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all the other Japanese monster movies, sit down and enjoy the chaos.
