If you've seen fewer films, this could be great for you. If you've seen a lot of movies, this is a joke. The acting of real heroes is very badly represented. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks and, above all, the fight scenes are performed stupidly. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood heroes / heroines, you can predict what will happen next. You don't feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protect are terrible, especially because we've seen this actor in another 1000 Hindi movies. Supposed to be a realistic film, but fails to show. There are times when you are wondering, you have thousands of soldiers filling up with soldiers moving and the Pakistanis are bombing them and none of their bombs hit them. Are the pakis really bad at aiming or did the director make them look stupid? There were only a few characters that said it was very good, but as for the plot, the action is badly directed. This movie could have been brief if they pulled out songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
