Two old friends are sent to Japan to get the results of a genetic search containing a videotape, which is stolen by black ninjas suited to the beginning of the film. First they just have to learn some ninja skills, because "only the ninja can defeat the ninja". <br /> <br /> Sakura's assassins strive to be fun with the ninja flick, but they fail badly. The whole film is so empty and predictable that it's hard to say something good: the same storyline has been seen in several variations dozens of times before, the characters are drawn too briefly, the direction is boring and the script offers nothing surprising , even in the final scene, which in itself reduced the value of the film (garbage). <br /> <br /> Even the ninja nerd fan of the 80s, which includes the aesthetics of trash movies, it is difficult to find this film even just barely pleasant. It simply offers nothing new to the spectators, neither in the visual level nor in the plot. The shurikens are thrown and the katanas oscillate, but it is not enough to guide the direction of the film they intended to be and resorting to similar fighting scenes also numbs the more calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to recommend films to anyone. Even the clumsy performance of Franco Nero in "Enter the Ninja" is part of the American ninja of the Sakura killer. Even in the films on a visual level there are no balls and it is useless to try to find grandiose fighting scenes in this film: there is none. In all, one of the most useless ninja flicks I've ever seen. He doesn't even care about curiosity. Trust me on this. <br /> <br /> Â½ of 10.
