I will say one thing about this film: there are no pauses. You can't get bored watching this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and you MUST rock! This is the risk you take in modern action movies. You want it interesting but not over the top. This is too much. <br /> <br /> Although you play well and have a couple of "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, you still have the feeling of a "B" movie. The best part of it is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality, but has had some prominent scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene with land mines. It was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a long time keeper.
