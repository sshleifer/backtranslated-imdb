Hi, I'm from Denmark, and one day I was having a movie night with my friends. One brought this film with him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely horrible. After watching less than half a minute, we decided to go ahead only by stopping at some laughable "highlights" or should I say "low lights" in the film. In fact, I was largely surprised to find that this film was produced here in my home country, Denmark ... which must have been the biggest mistake ever made in this country.
