I don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. This film was complete garbage. <br /> <br /> Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was adorable, cute, sweet, loving and extremely fun to watch. He had that innocence but at the same time he was also strong. <br /> <br /> This new guy, Alex? Annoying as all hell! Just an obvious rip-off in trying to match the charm and grace of Culkin, failing miserably in that. <br /> <br /> The bad guys, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were so funny on the screen. They were comedians, they were funny, and they really made you want to root for Culkin again, which is what a good villain should do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots who just fight and, again, try to capitalize on the charisma and charm of the first bad guys. Not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even so funny. More on the corneal side actually. <br /> <br /> Then we got the real movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect for looking around for Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas atmosphere and brings out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with history and cares about the characters. Simple, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Shit masterpiece. Just say. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't know why people like this. I think people don't really know what a good movie is. It's a nasty sequel sequel with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character that I wish the robbers would have beaten him at least. <br /> <br /> Run, run away from this garbage. And let's not even start with Part 4!
