The only positive thing about "People I Know" is that it serves as a perfect example of a film that Al Pacino should avoid performing. The first big turn-off I had was the way Pacino tried to play a Georgia accent; at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too exaggerated. The dialogue and the interaction between the characters were terrible and a weak plot. The supporting cast did an extremely superficial job of keeping the film interesting, and in less than an hour I saw no signs of a robust storyline. The whole story is a real nuisance, and I had to slap myself in the face a couple of times to keep me awake. <br /> <br /> This movie will definitely bore you ... you'll avoid at all costs.
