Who? What? Where is it? When? Why? The acting was terrible. Very robotic, tried. I've seen all the actors in this film in better roles. The script was very elementary. At the end of this film, the plot was blocked. And also Jeane Claude LaMarre should be tied. So that you never try to write / direct another film.
