I can't understand why so many peoples have praised this show. Twin Peaks is one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen all the episodes of season 1 and I have seen the episode of the first season 1. I simply can't take this show anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the right induction in criminal investigations? <br /> <br /> In season 1, there was a scene where agent Cooper throws stones at a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify the murderer by making this "joke" by mentioning the supernatural ability given by the dream of Tibet. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many useless scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, the second season began with a "funny" scene that an old fool serves Agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper lies on the floor (he has already fired his gun in his belly) . This old man is doing nothing but saying some stupid comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 sec .... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I would like to read some comics rather than see this show anymore
