This is really a new low level of entertainment. Although there are much worse films. <br /> <br /> In the genre of the Gangster / Drug scene it is difficult to have a convincing plot (this film is not, I mean that Sebastiano's motifs for example could not be more clich√©s, very unlikely and worn.) also need a setting of relationships of a credible nature (this film does not). <br /> <br /> Sure Tristan is attracted to his family, but why was it again? what has his father got back to that he has to ask permission to go out at his age? interesting image, however, to ask for the lack and the need for rebellious behavior of children in the upper class family. But this film does not go in this direction. Although there would be the potential judgment of random backflashes. He wasn't already down and out, why does he do it again? <br /> <br /> So there are some interesting questions presented here for a solid socially critical drama (but, again, this film is not, to focus on "cool" production techniques and special effects that do not give the characters a moment to reflect and above all to force the story along the path where they want it to be and not paying attention to let the story breathe and naturally evolve. <br /> <br /> It wants to be a drama in order not to glorify the abuse of substances and violence (it would be politically incorrect these days, right?) but on the other hand it is nothing more than an economic action film (as there are so many out there) with a medium series of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is succeeding in not totally ruining what remains of his reputation by doing what he always does. <br /> <br /> So all in all I ... just ... I can't recommend it. <Br /> <br / > 1 for Vinnie and 2 for modification.
