The fact that this film has come to charter in Norway is bizarre. This film is simply horrible. This image quality is only a little bit better than that of a mobile phone and the plot is really bad. The main character is simply annoying and the rest sucks. Every person affiliated with this film should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this film put their name on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; have they seen it? This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. To label this comedy is an insult to humanity. I urge you not to support this film by buying it or renting it.
