I ended up watching the tenants with my closest friends who rented the film exclusively based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the cover. Understandably, I didn't expect much. I thought the film included the typical array of Snoop Dogg behaviors and images that are often seen in rap clich√© videos. However, my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, this did not improve the film. <br /> <br /> Many describe the film as a serious and obscure drama, while I described it as a serious and boring drama. The film tells the story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their separate masterpieces. Their opposite polar lifestyle ends up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves through the entire film like a wild roller coaster - most of which is contributed by the character of Snoop - which reminds a person with a serious case of split personality disorder. And even if the film is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie for those who are alert altered because this has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue afterwards. There are some mediocre conflicts, but they too are mostly bogged down with more dialogues. The end, however, caught me by sudden surprise. It was a little distorted, a little unexpected and a perfect way to end a film that had to end. While watching the credits I could not help but imagine the director who thought, "Oh God, how the hell do I end this snoozer?" By the way, the director has carefully exposed suggestions and subtleties that lead to the climax, all much more visible than Waldo in a street crowded with dwarves wearing only black sweaters.
