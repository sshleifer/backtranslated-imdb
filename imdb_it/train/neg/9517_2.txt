Vincente Minelli's films are usually worthwhile; Meet me in Saint Louis, the bad and the beautiful. I have been waiting for this film with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Some Came Running is scene after scene of aimless fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointed afflicted man who lives in disappointment while a girl persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. The film has a great dramatic ending in which a disappointing villain reaches Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is meant to be full of tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; he becomes so distracted by the beautiful colors, he does not notice that the scene is a hissing clich√© and that the characters are drawn in a very thin and little developed way we are not particularly interested in being shot. (especially MacClane) But this is the only real cinematography of the project. Otherwise we look at the constipated characters standing around bars and living rooms that attack each other for two hours. Hell is other people, apparently. <br /> <br /> There is nothing that happens in this film. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after the Second World War is handled more skillfully in "The best years of our lives". And one of the two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end city, with much more fussiness.
