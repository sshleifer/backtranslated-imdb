Honestly, The Omega Code is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. During the first 30 minutes I sat dazed in my seat, trying to decide if I should ask for a refund. But since I hadn't paid to see him in the first place (he passes), I thought he might as well stay. And I didn't think it could get worse. <br /> <br /> He did it. I will quickly cross the lower points (including some spoilers): Casper Van Dien's horrible miscasting as Gillen Lane, a motivational speaker with two graduate students. The characterization was inconsistent; for example, Lane, despite his credentials, is a complete idiot. Then there is the disgusting description of the fulfillment of biblical prophecies; we see a series of sensational news notes accompanied by ridiculous fingerprints of the translated biblical code. Also, terrible "action" sequences: Lane escapes difficult situations without explanation and the only time Lane seems to be in danger turns out to be a dream sequence! It's nice for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an unforgivable plot device in a movie. The pace was bad: after a long opening, the first third of the film changes scenes every 90 seconds. Later, the pace improves, but there is still too much to do to jump. And as someone else has mentioned, the years pass and yet nobody (not even Lane's young daughter) ages. It was puzzling. <br /> <br /> There are some good things, though. The quality of the film (for example the lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. Outdoor shots have been well made and outdoor shots have added a touch of realism. Moreover, there are some moments in the last part of the film, when Lane calls God (finally) to help him - this has proved quite hilarious - even to me, someone who does not accept Jesus as a personal savior. But I liked it because it struck me as the only real scene in the film. Unfortunately, it was followed by an important incomprehension. <br /> <br /> The characters, the dialogue, the direction and the acting were all badly made. Michael Ironside had nothing to do, and Michael York was just weird. I think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been narrower and more focused, and the characterization was more detailed, the film would have been far better. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, The Omega Code disappoints. Definitely don't pay to see this. I give it ** on ten stars. <br /> <br />
