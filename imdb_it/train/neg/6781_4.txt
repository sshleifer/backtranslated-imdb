A good cast (with one big exception) makes its way through Epstein's intelligent satire. Mansfield has never been better, or more fun, than is paired here with Walston, who is a veteran determined to become a member of Congress to get out of the war. He and his friends - including the suave con-artist Grant - travel to San Francisco on leave and begin the city's swinginest party as they search to escape completely through industrial language tours. The only thing about this film that is not pleasant is the performance of a single note by Suzy Parker like Grant's love interest, which takes up too much time in the film and slows down the pace in the second half. Walston and Mansfield have good chemistry; the expedient is that she is ready to make love with every military (to do her duty for the war effort, of course) but she is a married man who, however, loves his wife. They steal the film with little trouble from Grant (which is fun here in the first part of the film, when he is not paired with his non-actor co-star.
