I just finished watching this on TV and what can I say, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen! I'm embarrassed to be from Melbourne, where the film was made. Evil acting, amateur makeup effects and a REALLY bad soundtrack. As for the plot, well, this is even more stupid! Some scenes left me stunned at how bad it was. There is a reason why they put these types of movies on TV late at night - because they are absolutely rubbish! Avoid at all costs.
