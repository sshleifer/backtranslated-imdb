I read all these reviews here about how this is a good movie. Gee, this movie was predictable and rather boring. The acting was below average most of the time, especially from Mckenna. I didn't see a more pathetic attempt at making someone "fucked up" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a disappointment. I also read somewhere that this could be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this film was just an average film. <br /> <br /> The script was lame, mostly the acting was lame, this movie was lame. <Br /> <br /> Oh and pray for the boy who was in Cheers. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this film was probably the Office Space guy, and he was alone in this movie for about 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> 4/10
