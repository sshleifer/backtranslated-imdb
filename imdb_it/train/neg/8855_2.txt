Yes, the first "Ululato" was a classic. A pretty good werewolf film that I admit started off slowly, but I gained momentum along the way to have a pretty good ending, then the presenter turned into a cute werewolf just to be shot at the camera. Yes, that was a funny horror movie to be sure ... well, forget all this because this movie has nothing to do with that movie. Oh, sure, they can understand that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is trying to find out what and why things went down as they went, but they go from the small cozy shelter from the first movie in Transylvania or somewhere here where they have to fight the evil wizard's werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee is doing in this film, however I read the banality here where he says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but continues to read the script before playing a role. Perhaps you could have gotten a hell of "An American Werewolf in London" that would have been possible. After all it was set in London. Why, werewolves don't seem to figure much in this film except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this film for me was when the only girl started talking loudly and this guy's ear started bleeding.
