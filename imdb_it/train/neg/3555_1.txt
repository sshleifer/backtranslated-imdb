Years ago a film became a friend and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it was John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavettes was an actor, writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated three times for the Oscars, who wrote and directed a series of good low-budget films using his revenue actor to keep afloat. Until we saw the Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavetes' income had been derived from any film he was offered. If we had known what the film was about, before seeing it, we could have avoided it altogether. But we didn't go out. At that time, my friend and I jokingly indicated that it was the worst movie ever made. Now frankly, this is not true. I saw a lot of movies badly made Friday night on Cinemax (I just said it out loud?) Which are much worse than The Incubus. Almost all the films with Brian Bosworth are by definition a worse film than The Incubus. Certainly Santa Claus conquers the Martians is a film worse than that of the Incubus. However, since then I have constantly used the Incubus as a threshold below which I don't want to fall. When I talk to a friend from a movie I saw, I will always notice that it was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
