I thought the whole line of the movie would be to see a rich white guy who behaved like Chris Rock, and then see Chris Rock react to people's reactions. Instead, you simply see Chris Rock being himself and the people who don't understand him. There are maybe 2 scenes in the whole movie where they use their stunt. This should have been much better.
