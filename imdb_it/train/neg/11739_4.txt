The often reliable Leonard Maltin states that it is a "delicious love story" and that Sanders is "superb". Maltin must have confused this film with something else. Sanders is snide and funny and superb, as usual, ?? you can imagine his handing over of the adultery line, "Sometimes the marriage chains are so heavy that they must be carried by three", but boring, wooden and dated describe this film more accurately. The plot itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes the chief of police but can hardly resist the temptation of fine jewelry, is quite funny, but has the same kind of hollow historical treatment as Hollywood which has spoiled epics of that period as * Marie Antoinette *, and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * (who screams for a class remake). Although, in his defense, Sanders tries to add some depth to his character, it's useless. I'm a huge fan of Douglas Sirk, but this is 1946, and is one of Sirk's first American attempts, devoid of many distinctive touches that would define his thriving and breast-raising potentiators. Sirk is just wetting his feet here and has made a series of non-memorable films in the next ten years until he hit gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and started beating us with estrogen bombardments like * All That Heaven Loows *, * Written on the wind * and * Imitation of life *. But * Scandal In Paris * is barely his best work ?? a relatively low-budget affair with ineffective cheese sets and costumes.
