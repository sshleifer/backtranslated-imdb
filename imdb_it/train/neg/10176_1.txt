It consists of a sequence in which an enraged coach throws a baseball into the wall behind him just to make him hit the cement and bounce and crush him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few lines, that's all this film has to offer ... quite said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally disabled, typically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also simply bad. Even non-critical members of the public will hate this movie with everything they have. It's so familiar that it's not funny. <br /> <br /> How many times must the same sports film be made? In the last few years we have seen this same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver", and however bad the film was, this is even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see together on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Teenagers? Senior citizens? The people who are so desperate for entertainment that they would rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The film, like many others like this, has a fundamental point that it tries to do: teamwork wins everyone over. Yes, and what a great moral to try. It is a pity that we have already seen it and we have excited it many times many times with so much talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in ballerina costumes. Where the stupid announcers form their "routine of comedies" by muttering a lining to themselves as "They suck", "This fast ball for children is timed with an hourglass," "This boy left the ball for a while to find something he missed - maybe it was his mind, "" Someone needs a nap "and" never see a sunset as beautiful as that show ". Where the characters have so little meaning to one another that we never know them by name. And where the unique and heartfelt conference on teamwork is so unaware that it's almost fun. <br /> <br /> "Major League Back to the minor" is so ugly; it blocks its trivial end right in the middle of a good closing sequence. The good baseball team is in comeback, they are going to win and the power goes out. For a moment I thought this piece of junk had come to a conclusion, but in reality, its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time. The film basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw so many putrid jokes that they are not funny. There is another very entertaining line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long-time home run is no longer wanted in that position. The coach's answer: "You are too old, too slow and too fat". The player's reaction is to die for. But that scene certainly doesn't make this movie worthy of note, and certainly not worth a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here is another terrible entrée in this kind of film, another that is doomed with its own script, which failed before seeing it, and another that is so familiar looks like deja vu again. <br /> <br />
