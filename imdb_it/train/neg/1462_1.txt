This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this film isn't even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then it's all downhill from there. We have Hitler's father who curses his own misfortune on the "fact" that he married his niece! They were in fact second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called her father, Alois, "uncle" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and raised as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child he had made the habit of calling Alois, "uncle". <br /> <br /> The scene in the trenches in which Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take him on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all the spectators. We see Hitler chasing the dog through the trench, when he reaches the poor creature who continues to beat her to disobey him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and punish the cowardly little fellow, but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, we are told, is killed outright. How, then, if Hitler were the only person who survived the scene, did he come to tell himself this story of brutality and cowardice? Did Hitler himself go about "bragging" about it? - I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Go ahead, Hitler is a bully and intimidates a poor, stressed and war-tired Jewish officer to give him an iron cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland, and he had thoughtfully brought along some medals promised by his shop, because I'm sure Iron Crosses was not distributed as shown in this comic farce. <br /> <br /> All the grotesque clich√©s are here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music on the little man. If only the producers kept Ian Kershaw on the side. Then they could find out that Franz Lehar's "Merry Widow" was more likely to float on the Fuhrer's boat than any "Flying Dutchman" from Richard Wagner's cannon! <br /> <br /> Hitler may have been responsible for the death of 60 million people, but how can he ever be forgiven for his horrible taste for music? <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I would try for hours. <br /> <br /> Give it a miss.
