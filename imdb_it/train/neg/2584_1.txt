So, American Pie: Beta House is the sixth American Pie movie in the series. Although, in reality, it has nothing to do with the three original American Pie films, except for some of the characters that should be linked to the characters in the original trilogy and in which Eugene Levy is (it is not possible that that guy give better concerts?). <br /> <br /> There is little to say about this film. There are no funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the "southern" accent that looks more like a Canadian imitation of a British woman pretending to be a mountaineer using the word "ya'll". This movie makes me feel such an idiot. Because I didn't apply for a college where nobody goes to class (but everyone has good grades), girls regularly take off their clothes, everyone has unprotected unprotected sex without the burden of children and STIs, and you can ejaculate everywhere family photos of a girl without her attention? In fact, this series has dropped to the standards of softcore porn. Perhaps for the next, they will eventually surrender and take on Ron Jeremy as the protagonist. I'm sure they can simply tie him to the series by making his character a third Stifler uncle once removed or something like that.
