I think this would have been a much better film if the Cajuns had been portrayed in a more credible light. My family is native to the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I never heard the people I grew up talking to like these people did. The Cajun were portrayed as rednecks back. Most of the Cajun I know are well-mannered, proud people and don't seem at all ignorant when they talk like these people did. All in all it was an OK movie, with great scenes and music. I understand that the writers came from Lake Charles, and that we know the area, but for the sake of all things Cajun, please the actors study the language, live among the people who portray and understand everything about how they are before going to try act like them. In my opinion, when actors make you believe I'm that person, it's a much more fun movie!
