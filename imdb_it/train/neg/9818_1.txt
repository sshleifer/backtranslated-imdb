This film raises a series of pressing questions in my mind. Firstly, how has Jennifer Tilly been able to sustain an acting film career all these years, based on that ridiculous shrill voice and the very limited range of hammer-shaped facial expressions she uses? Secondly, what the hell were the people responsible for having thought of this offensive and deeply repugnant film? And thirdly ... since there were people perverted enough to decide to do dreck this way, there shouldn't be anyone in the system - the studio, the distributors, or somewhere - healthy enough to keep them from being completed and released . You should really look for a very, very long way to present another film as profoundly bad as this ... and it's not even advertised as a horror movie - which, as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate movie genre, it certainly is. The film opens up from beginning to end in the worst kind of madness, violence and abuse, and has virtually no redeeming features. Actually I'm not advocating censorship (which I don't believe) ... but I really can't understand how anyone can conceive something positive by watching a movie like this.
