This was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but this is the most that can be said about it. Start with a good atmosphere; the hospital is adequately sterile and alienating, the mood is set to "disturbing". And then ... nothing. Well, something. Only something that clearly does not fit ... and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and not particularly intimidating critters, and the hospital they took over. I mean come on, guys, guys? Some bands looked a little too Gwar. My favorite was the demon chief, who looked more like a middle-aged trucker who desperately tried to threaten, while at the same time it seemed that he would really prefer to lower himself onto an Afghan-covered sofa, unfasten his belt, open a can of cheap beer (probably Schlitz) and watch the game. Honestly, I've seen much scarier truckers. At truck stops. Drinking coffee. WWWwoooooohHHHHHoooooooo !!!! Frightening !! <br /> <br /> The other monsters are even more fun and even less scary. At least, on the DVD, the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital ... apparently they appear randomly in places, play a bippy "metal" and make people die a little. Except for some good special effects and acting that is not entirely terrible given the lack of decent writing, there is nothing here. It's just a background movie.
