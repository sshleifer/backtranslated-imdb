... know the rest If you want a good zombie movie, DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary look on the "hooded waist", you're in the wrong place too. If you're looking for a ridiculous piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is surely the officer who is investigating drive-by. I can say that he made the voice for the 911 operator even with the flat tone of his voice. If you could hear a cardboard box speak, it would probably look like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" have made their best snake impression which is on par with their general FANTASTIC acting (note the sarcasm ... HOW IT MADE YOU DIDN'T WIN AN Oscar FOR THE BEST MAKEUP) The Quiroz. ..... did not do any directing. I felt like I was looking at a piece of improvisation (the period is more similar to that of the 90s). However, directing is enhanced by the worst script I think will ever embellish a film. I haven't heard such beautiful lines, like the epic word that begins with the movie "F ** k!", Since Ice Grill was another "urban" thriller. This only works naturally in conjunction with the even-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 songs of it! All in all, what the hell did you expect from a movie called "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the full intention of laughing at every scene, and the boy delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get together with a group of kids and laugh at a low budget horror movie (yes, yes ...) for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
