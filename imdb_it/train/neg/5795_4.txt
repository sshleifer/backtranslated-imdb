"Lies" tells of a relationship between a student with 18-year-old long hair and a skinny, 38-year-old married man with the pair of protags that spends about half the screen engaged in naked sex and whipping and the other half snaking through the pathetically naive plot that seems little more than an excuse for sex scenes. With very little production value, including obvious sanitary appliances and fake softcore sex, to a story that is a messy mixture of comedy and drama, "Lies" quickly becomes redundant to the point of nausea. With a performance of almost 2 hours, subtitles and so little substance, "Lies" is simply not recommended. (C-)
