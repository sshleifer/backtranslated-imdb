Not as bad as you heard. There are actually some fun parts and Affleck and Applegate have a pretty good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is as attractive and likeable as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are experienced professionals. They are pretty good at almost everything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst vacation movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not focused and much of the play is forced. Attempts at dark humor diminish as severe. Affleck strives to be captivating spastic and too enthusiastic but feels disturbed. The cartoon-like nature of his character is brought to prominence when seen alongside the more subdued and credible exhibits of Gandolfini and O'Hara. Even for the relaxing standards of holiday movies, you will never fully buy the Affleck set that "rents" this family for X-mas. <br /> <br /> There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness. Christmas Eve is full of incestuous humor (a son is discovered by looking at his mother's naked and provocative images) which is not only not funny or believable but disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors of this film are muddy, almost noir. The house where most of the film takes place seems scenic and economical. <br /> <br /> "Surviving" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a box office series (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this one) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how long the damage will last.
