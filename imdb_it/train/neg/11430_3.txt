Ok, let me make a new word here: polyphobia: the fear of polyamory relationships. This is yet another in a long series of films that start by tickling the audience on a sort of trio, just to turn on a coin and all go and preach about how it is so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution . Only one person in a thousand understands the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark my words: in a few decades polyphobia will be a misstep as much as homophobia, but guess who was too close to realize it? Right the first time: the producers of this film. And so many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-style type of film like this? He boasts of being infinitely open-minded about homosexuality, completely neglects the fact that we live in an age in which monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy, which in turn turns into oscillating and polyamory. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing and rude chick-flick. (But damn, I have to say, Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
