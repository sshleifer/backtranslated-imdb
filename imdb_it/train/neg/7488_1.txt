Anyone who has seen the original 1970 movie knows that an excellent cast, screenplay and director can put together a comedy masterpiece. For the same reason, it is easy to see how the opposite of that can create another insipid Hollywood-boredom! This film was pathetic! If it hadn't been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have gone out for about 15 minutes in this terrible celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not have written another script for this version (he said he failed to improve the first), and I am surprised that after this movie fiasco he would not sue for libel of humor! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did a great job at the original, what were the producers thinking when they launched this? How could the director and editor watch these scenes and think that some of them were funny? I don't know, but one thing I know - it's no surprise because foreign and independent films are becoming increasingly popular .......
