Filmfour will have to do much better than this little snot of a movie if they have the right reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This film is set in Glasgow (although only a couple of secondary characters have something that comes close to a Scottish accent). The premise, regarding the people who are living a life anywhere, who all meet in the same bar in the early morning hours because they have a night job, could have created a really entertaining, penetrating, eccentric and cult movie. Instead we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot that has been so torn up that I'm surprised it's not banned. X and Y are friends. X is sleeping with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh you understand. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it seemed like something a 16-year-old group would write for a dramatic GCSE project. The female character was completely superfluous - only written as a symbolic woman in the hope that the women would have enjoyed seeing him. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of junkie who laughs at beer advertisements and can usually find themselves wandering around in packs screaming Saturday night in anonymous urban centers, then you'll love this movie and find it "a person right. " All the others, run, don't get away from this miserable misfit. <br /> <br /> And a question, when the group left the "boring" seaside town (Saltcoats incidentally even though they changed the name in the film), to return to Glasgow, because they did it via the motorway services Forton to LANCASTER, located in England?
