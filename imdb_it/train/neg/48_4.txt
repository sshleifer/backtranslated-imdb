There are some beautiful shots in this film, which captures some of the landscapes with such beautiful light, in fact cinematography is probably the best resource. <br /> <br /> But it's basically more of a TV movie, and although it has a lot of plot twists, which keeps a pretty interesting view, there are no subtitles and key plot developments are revealed in Spanish, so non-Spanish speakers will be left a little lost. <br /> <br /> I had it as a Christmas present, because it is a family trait working through the films of an actor that we find talented, and Matthew Mconaughey was simply fantastic in "A Time to kill", and "The Newton Boys" so I expressed that I wanted to see more of his work. <br /> <br /> However, although a Matthew Mconaughey film is written on the DVD box and uses it as a marketing ploy, it has a few lines and is on the screen for not much minutes at the end of the film, it is basically an extra and does not illuminate the screen exactly while it is on, so hard fans, the ally is not worth it from this point of view. <br /> <br /> The movie star, however, Patrick McGaw is fantastic and very simple to the eye, and his character is so cute, kind and caring, a true saint of a boy, it would be well written in a com ROM. <br /> <br /> So, for the sincere magnificence of Mcconaughey of those I've seen, I'd recommend "A time to kill", "The Newton Boys" "Frailty", "How to lose a boy in 10 days", " Edtv "and" Amistad "and also avoids" Larger Than Life "and" Angels in the Outfield "unless you hear a film for children or children around like none of them are indicative of his talent, but they are quite funny movies for children, once again MM is really nothing more than a support artist with a few lines if none. <br /> <br /> As for Scorpion, Springit's is not a bad movie, but it's not even a screen that steals.
