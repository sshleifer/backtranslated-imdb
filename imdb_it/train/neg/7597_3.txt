I love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in cinema. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this image. but. . . <br /> <br /> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No sir, nothing good in this. The only funny aspect for me is that the character of Colin Farrell is an insecure writer and this script, despite having dealt with the juicy theme of racism, approaches the public in the manner of an ABC Afterschool Special. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't seem like "acting" was Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Stale approach to a tired plot.
