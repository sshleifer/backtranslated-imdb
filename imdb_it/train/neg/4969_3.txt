First of all, this is not at all as bad as some of the other wastes that the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; this does not mean that Grendel is a good film, on the contrary, it is very bad, but it certainly has the potential to be much better. The defects of the film derive from character design, from character, from absurd additions to the plot, from visual effects, from music and, for the most part, from acting. <br /> <br /> When I talk about character design, I of course mean the way our heroes and villains appear. Beowulf and the other Danes look like ridiculous Vikings, rather than warriors of brute force - that helmet that our main character wears is simply too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle attacks on his elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from beginning to end, however Finn - a useless companion - has achieved a bit of two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth has some notion, as he becomes less presumptuous. <br /> <br /> Just like Finn, there are unnecessary additions to this story to make it his own, while still clinging to the original material. The crossbow given to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast didn't come out of the set. In addition to additions, there are omissions, such as the fundamental themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are ill-conceived, and as such, their screen portrait is less credible. <br /> <br /> Music is overpowering, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst science fiction film to date. No. Actually it is one of the best films, even if it is still junk, it is a good junk, making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is dialogue, which is still wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend skipping this film and seeing Robert Zemeckis's interpretation of Beowulf's ancient story, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the story, not the whole thing, which makes this film a three-star review.
