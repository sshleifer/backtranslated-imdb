Ah, the sex-and-gore movie. Too bad they don't do them anymore (unless you live in Japan). But if they all turned out that way, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The film basically consists of the two adorable vampires who collect "johns" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except the first victim, who they keep around for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women that she continues to see. It gets really ugly from here. In the end, the two vampires are so bloodthirsty that they are eating everything in sight and are able to escape from the captive victim. Oops, so much for that secret existence. The fact that the two vampires do not have to take off their clothes and joke is the only thing this film has in store for this. Otherwise, is it a bloody and confusing mess (why is their grave so far from their castle?), Accessible only for the few minutes of vampiric recreation. The only thing I got from this movie are these two valuable tips: shooting lesbians won't kill them; he will transform them only into vampires and, they do not collect prostitutes along a country road; they're probably vampires. Apart from that, it wasn't really worth my time.
