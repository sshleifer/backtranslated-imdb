I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "movie" are shareholders of the production company, as this was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the initial blow of a rabbi who laughed uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this film would kill to be considered "level B". Both my wife and I were in good spirits before starting this film, and we couldn't wait to see a funny popcorn movie. We knew we had not rented the Citizen Kane and we did not expect to see the most incredible film ever. However, after 40 minutes of putting up with the most inedible piece of trash I have ever seen, we turn it off instead of wasting other minutes of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" without laughter, terrible acting, subtle plot and boring characters are your passion, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the pop corn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can't justify writing a longer review of this photo because I've already lost almost an hour trying to find a joke.
