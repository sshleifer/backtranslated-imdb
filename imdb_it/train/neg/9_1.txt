This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. It almost always tears the type of thriller and manages to make a mess of everyone. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good line or character in the whole mess. If there was a plot, it was an afterthought and as far as acting is concerned, there is nothing good to say, so don't say anything. I honestly can't understand how this kind of nonsense is produced and actually released, someone somewhere doesn't think sometime, "Oh my god, this is really a load of shit" and I call it a day. His shit like this that illegally downloaded people, the trailer looks like a completely different movie, at least if you downloaded it, you didn't waste time and money. Don't waste time, this is painful.
