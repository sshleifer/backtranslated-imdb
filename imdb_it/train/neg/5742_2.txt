When I borrowed this film from a friend (thankfully I didn't buy it) on the package (which looked really ugly and ugly) "The ultimate vampire horror" was printed. After seeing it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is chased by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and all this reminded me of my first attempt to make a video vacation on ten old VHS systems if not worse. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and just because the promotional t-shirts looked pretty interesting. I don't want to dis-film-students or splatter-films in general, but I saw Braindead and saw a $ 20 student film that was ten times better than this shit.
