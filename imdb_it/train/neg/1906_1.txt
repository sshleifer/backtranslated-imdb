They played this in the Twilight Zone marathon on July 4th and this is, without a doubt, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It is completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Although Twilight Zone is a rather irregular series and many episodes end up being incredibly predictable, this was completely out of place. Compare this with legendary episodes such as "A Stop at Willoughby" or "Midnight Sun" and you realize that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprises me that someone from his historical comic height would have dropped to the level of this episode. Even though he seems to be giving him some effort, he MUST have needed the money ... there's no other explanation.
