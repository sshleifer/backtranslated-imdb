I was so excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. Even my 13-year-old son couldn't wait to do it. I rented and curled up to enjoy a classic holiday story shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed. This film came out of the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor, but in this, it seemed that he was fully in the character only about 20% of the time. For the rest of the time it was pretty flat. I realize that this was done in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it seemed to be the quality of the B movie, especially the meeting with Jacob Marley. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas brings Scrooge around the world, watching people in the darkest circumstances who still have light and love for Christmas. <br /> <br /> I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the "reformed" Scrooge at the end. It was a refreshing portrait. I wish Bob Cratchit had been painted as a little more torn and trampled. And Tiny Tim ... oh, don't even let me start with bad actors ...
