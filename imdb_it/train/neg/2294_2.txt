Poor Paul Mercury. After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, the best film in history, he managed to find himself making a pile of garbage. None of the characters in this film is very unpredictable, or even challengeable, but Mercury's guide is the kind of person you prefer to ignore: completely impeccable and wearing OVERALLS. Big mistake in costume design, that.
