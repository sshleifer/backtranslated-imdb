This is a rather docile piece that concerns the codes of the Second World War that are violated, stolen, etc. The acting is about what I expected from this cast of MGM series actors. <br /> <br /> A lot of attention. Jean Rogers, who did a great job playing the very sexy Dale Arden in the first two episodes of Flash Gordon, is simply horrible in this film. His character is extremely annoying. Absolutely not bewildered by her. We should believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code, she would be allowed to enter and leave any office of her choice even if it has no official function. From this point of view, I'm sorry I never saw this movie. It changed my perception of Mrs. Rogers forever. Talentwise, it is extremely light. <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman is his usual self, which means that it is simply adequate. <br /> <br />
