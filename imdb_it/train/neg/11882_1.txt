I passed this on the shelf a few times, looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes (with tiny names) on the front and wondering if I was missing something. The other night he was on one of the channels in the film, and I tuned in. I missed nothing. I have to admit that I only saw the first 30 minutes. Perhaps the film becomes comedy gold after that. Given the slow and sluggish pace and the complete lack of laughter in the first 30, I seriously doubt it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of the film is the classic "I don't know how to start my film", with a long and boring monologue about how he doesn't want to be denounced. It's not funny. It's not even remotely funny. Others have commented on the "San Franclisco" bit; ok, a little laugh the first time he says it. Then he grinds it into the ground, smiling at the camera as if it were the funniest thing ever written. Overcome yourself. Actually, I think talking to the camera was the reason I didn't like the movie. Don't take familiarity with your audience. Familiarity is _ learned_, very similar to respect. <br /> <br /> From there, in practice, you have a fat and plaintive man who speaks in a very effeminate way of his boring life as a timing. I didn't realize he was a Jew; It is a discredit for Jewish comedians to call this "Jewish humor". It's just not funny humor. Just because you're Jewish doesn't mean you have a talent for comedy. A WASP, Spalding Gray, has a better job of this guy's self-analytical humor, so obviously it's not about ethnicity. <br /> <br /> If one of the bits I saw had worked, I could have stayed around. But a bit of history about how much he loves the names of the women he works with, so listing them for five long minutes, is not a great film. <br /> <br /> This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of "Office Space". Don't make yourself a victim of target marketing. Just say no to "Haiku Tunnel".
