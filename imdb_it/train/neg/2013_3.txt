This film is about what it seems: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and sex scenes (quite meek)! The film is not sure what it wants to be and practically ends up in a mess. It is more expensive than most of the films of director Adam Adamson, but it is not at the same budget level that viewers expect from science fiction films. The actors are pretty mean and, unlike most of Adamson's films, there are no former big names or actors B. Part of the music is OK but it's easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
