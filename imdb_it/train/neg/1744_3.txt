I saw the Malayalam movie "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which in turn is probably inspired by an English film of the same name) a long time ago. The basic story of Garam Masala is the same, but it is told in a pathetic way, the class bars replaced by the routine ones found in normal Hindi films (probably the director did this to satisfy the taste of the Hindi public). .. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the English original. But he really enjoyed the film Malayalam (made by Priyadarshan himself) which was a split comedy at the time. Of course the acting of Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who played the role of the cook) was so natural and spontaneous. Probably, I'm too impressed by the Malayalam movie that I can't tolerate even the smallest flaws in his Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have exaggerated. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but does not reach any place near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> But all in all it's OK, if you compare it with other recent Hindi comedies.
