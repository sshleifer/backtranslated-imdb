The Christmas specialties of December, like the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy, but carefree plot. They should have a touch of the mystical magic of the holidays. Basically, they should look, sound and feel ... well, "special" and should have a decent and appropriate subtext for the December holidays. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the legend of Frosty the snowman on TV lists, I had my kids pumped (6 and 8) by telling them the story of the original Frosty and telling with passion how much I was liked as a child. While my wife and my children crouched on the couch to watch the movie, the expectations were high, but for 10 minutes my children were yawning and my wife and I were exchanging the "look" and looking up at the sky. After 35 minutes my children were really asking to go to bed - I guess they were tired of insensitive language and useless and disconnected segments. I was really embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Legend of Frosty the Snowman is more like a bad episode of Fairly Odd Parents with a Sponge Bob episode than a classic holiday movie. Don't get me wrong ... those shows are good and I like them as much as the next, but when I watch discreet parents or Sponge Bob, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind-numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We chose some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the legendary and embarrassing Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
