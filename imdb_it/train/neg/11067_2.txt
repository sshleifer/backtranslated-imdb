I'm a big fan of the real crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this putrid piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotic, up to the soundtrack of porn flic. You didn't see what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but "Look how disturbing this guy is." And I have to give the directors so much - their Dahmer is the most disturbing thing that has ever managed to dishonor the screen.
