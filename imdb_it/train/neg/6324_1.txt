I spent eight years directing films in the 80s and 90s. This was, by far, the worst movie I've ever shown to the public. One thing that has made it so negative is that it has put a strain on the attempt to be a fantastic and inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Peck failed to save this horrible piece of nonsense from being much less mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis, in a role as the first non-horror film, clearly showed that he had not yet learned to act (he is still trying, but he is not improving much). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, and here is the spoiler, international nuclear disarmament will never happen just because it makes children worry about playing Little League Baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel aren't stupid enough to make us believe that dreck. <br /> <br /> It is not worth wasting time watching it on cable TV. It is not worth the price of a movie rental; your dollar would be better spent on an extra packet of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it can only be better than this).
