There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? AND WHY DO THEY DO THIS BAD ??? The premise is absurd. The acting is one-dimensional. The special effects are exaggerated. And the film is an endless firefight between some of the most beloved shots Hollywood has ever produced. But then, if they had been good shots, everyone would have died in the first five minutes and there would have been no film. Too bad it didn't happen that way. Attempted to shut it down several times, I paused to see how bad it could get. I'm glad I did it because (SPOILER?) The last joke is the incorporeal stupidity of all the terrifying, gloomy scenery. Nor is it worthy of a second feature at a third drive-in in the off-season. Apart from the general appearance of the film, I deeply worry about its impact on the young audience. Americans come up with bullshit like this and then wonder why events like Columbine happen. This is really a trivial cinema on a Brobdingnagian scale!
