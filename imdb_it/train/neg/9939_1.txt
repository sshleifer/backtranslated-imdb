Film school intellectuals can drool over everything they want about the important meaning (imagined) of this film, but it's just that: intellectual drooling. This film is creatively bankrupt, and some confuse that it is a saw that defines itself as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because it would have been fantastic. He is capturing the birth of this timeless song and instead chooses to cover the music with a guy who reads a True Detective magazine or some of this crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of what looks like a 60s booklet spraying the words on people's cars. And then there is the seemingly endless "interview" in which the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all truly profound and intellectual questions. There is a guy in a purple suit who is reading more crap from a book, which goes on for, oh, just for about 20 minutes. And black panthers or something in a landfill. <br /> <br /> Does it seem almost intriguing? Well, it's not. <br /> <br /> But for the unwashed film school hipsters who don't mind the squat opportunity missed to have full access to the Stones bringing sympathy for the Devil to the world and would prefer to hear about it while watching the covers of mag nudies, this film is a real winner! <br /> <br /> More precisely ... maybe Godard blows.
