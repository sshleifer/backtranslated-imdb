No wonder this was released directly on DVD here in Australia, no feature that redeems it ever. The dialogue was disgusting, the acting, horrible and the script sucked !! Anyone who thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel or follow John Badham's hit movie, Wargames from the 80s, well, must have been on something because it was a bad idea !! Amanda Walsh was good with open eyes / love interest, while Matt Lanter was as good as the other main character - that's all. I wouldn't recommend Wargames: The Dead Code to anyone, check out the Hackers or the original Wargames movie - both are better than this piece of shit !!
