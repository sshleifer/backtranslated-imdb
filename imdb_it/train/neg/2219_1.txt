Perhaps one of the most famous horror classics ever made, Halloween includes the memorable Michael Myers and some great actors from Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as is an unmissable amount of time spent on dullness / culmination at real events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can take away from popcorn in the microwave and don't miss anything. <br /> <br /> As it has generated so many sequels, I will never understand it. <br /> <br /> Thank God Rob Zombie is redoing this. And in general, I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> It will surely compensate more than all the random time filling gaps with some eccentric points of interest to which the original is definitely missing. <br /> <br /> This is a film we feel like, very similar to the way we are taught that we should have fun with Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't assume this is a classic.
