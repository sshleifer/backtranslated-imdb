I am obliged to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means to warn others to SAVE. Almost all the episodes of "The Human Animal" by Desmond Morris or "The Nature of Things" by David Suzuki could have improved the material presented. Not only does the director fail to use the incredible IMAX 65 to 70 mm movie and giant presentation screen, everything on the screen is extremely insignificant given the accessibility of this previously mentioned programming. Spectators are introduced to a pregnant woman, her husband Buster and her niece and nephew. We follow them for an endless forty minutes while they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we are given access to scenes within the human digestive track and we learn about the reflections of children's natural dives, do we really learn more than most primary school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic heather? Do we care? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX function, I suggest you take a picture of "India: the kingdom of the tiger" beautifully photographed or technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
