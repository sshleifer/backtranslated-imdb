The fact that he watched the whole movie says something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. In fact terrible. But terrible in the way he kept my attention in that perverse way that is similar to looking at a tragedy and not being able to look elsewhere. It would have been a great MST3K subject! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a terrible movie fun are here: bad dialogues, inappropriate music, fictional plot sequences, ridiculous pseudosciences. You will have fun trumpeting the death sequences, the poor victims with their mouths wide open and waaaaaaaay too long to contemplate their imminent fate, facing the outrageously invented liberator of their deaths. Your heart will be warmed by the old clich√©s of the action scenes like when two women fight for a gun and leaves, but WHO'S SHOT? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), one finally comes down. You will sing (in Latin of course) with street carolers turning into a horrible chorus of death that, for a moment, threatened to turn the film into a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you believe that if I do it while the movies get worse, they get better, then this could be a decent choice for you. It's not as fun as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, "They Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's more fun to watch warm movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10.
