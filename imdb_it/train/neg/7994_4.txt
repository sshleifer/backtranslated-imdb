A worthless film made for a television movie that practically follows the script of murderous insects. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. I think it's from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant's bed. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it's not even scary. Watching a group of ants prick their victims is not very terrifying. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Section The stupidity of the hero is almost unbelievable. He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It must be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and destroys the huge colony of ants. This disturbs the millions of ants and traps people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> End spoiler Overall, this film is extremely lame. I don't understand why he had a DVD release when there are not so many worthy films. My only hypothesis for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is present in the film. This is a film to avoid.
