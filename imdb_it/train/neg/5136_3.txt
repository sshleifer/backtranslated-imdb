He falls into the film category of "Too ridiculous in dialogues and execution departments to be taken seriously". While I scream if you know what I did last Friday the thirteenth or my boyfriend knows they are bad, the scarecrows don't. Evil Dead has set such a high standard for comic horror on a budget genre, that Scarecrows is simply out of place. <br /> <br /> The suspicions of inexperience are immediately at stake as there are no signs of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airplane in flight. The repeated display of a photo of 3 men screams only for a narrative arc, but nothing comes. Although men are obviously scarecrows, there are no explanations. <br /> <br /> Know that this film is too serious because its good can produce smiles. I don't remember if Joe Bob Briggs ever saw Scarecrows in preview, but I guess he wouldn't go that low. However, with an IMDb rating of over 6, there are many people who disagree.
