Images that usually glorify a hero have meaning. For example, Bonnie and Clyde have glorified the dynamic bank robbers and in reality you have felt sympathy for them despite their bad deeds. Why? They were two people trapped in depression when people desperately wanted to survive. <br /> <br /> This film has absolutely no substance. Viggo Mortensen's character soon emerges as a folk hero. Why? He accelerates along an Idaho highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife was taken. No one cares to understand why he is trying to escape from everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes obvious that he is not a red-necked terrorist, no one in the government wants to help him while they try to save their hindquarters. <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley is co-star as a radio emcee who builds history in support of our hero. <br /> <br /> The finish is absolutely incredible.
