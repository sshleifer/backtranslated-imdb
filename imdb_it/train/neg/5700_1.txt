The way this film gets a score of 6.7 is incredible. It deserves nothing better than a 2.0 and should clearly rank among the worst 100 IMDb movies of all time. National Treasure is an affront to national intelligence and just another assault made by the American public from Hollywood. Critics have told of holes in the plot through which to drive a 16-wheeler vehicle. <br /> <br /> I love the justification for the fact that this film is good ... "Nicholas Cage is cute." Come on people, it's no wonder people all over the world think that Americans are stupid. This must be the most stupid and offensive film I've ever seen. If you wanted to see a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. The national treasure unfortunately has much more publicity than those terrifying films. I bet many of you reading this haven't even heard of them, since some have not yet been widely published. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is an exceptional actor - when he's in the right movies. From time to time I saw Cage waste his terrifying talent in terrible films like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is put to good use as in Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation, he is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - I would rather feed a wood chipper than undergo this visual atrocity.
