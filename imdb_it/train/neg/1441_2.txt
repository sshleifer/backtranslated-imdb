I chose this film on the cover thinking I had an adventure on the level of "Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom". Unfortunately I was in a virtual yawn. Not like every yawn I had before though. This yawn was so big that I couldn't find anything quality in this movie. The cover described incredible special effects. There were none. The film was so light that even the stereotypes were portrayed terribly. It gives the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your children that. I do not. Stay away from this. If you are looking for family entertainment, you may find something that is more challenging elsewhere.
