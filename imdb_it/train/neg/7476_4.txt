Evil Aliens owes a huge debt to the first films of Peter Jacksons, Bad Taste and Braindead. I must confess that I don't enjoy those films in particular and I say the same. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration and chooses to steal Those who look up. I have lost count of the number of times a Hollywood movie has been mentioned in particular James Camerons Aliens. Even the amount of blood and blood on display here is not fun, the last part of the film gets tired and dragged out. Perhaps it would have worked better as a short film. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot does not exist. I can see what the director was trying to do, the tribute he was trying to pay, but others have done the same thing much better than presented here. 4/10
