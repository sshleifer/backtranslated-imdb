-SPOILES- A lame adventure film south of the border that has something to do with the blackmail of Rosenlski, the president of Unasco Inc., a great co-executive co-operator, with beachcomber David Ziegler who lives the life of Reilly, or Ziegler, at his home beach in Cancun, Mexico. Having this CD, which he gave to his brother James, who has three years of telephone conversations between Rosenlski and the President of the United States involved in criminal affairs. This CD gave David an advantage over the international mobsters who follow him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James is a bit greedy trying to shake Rosenlski for 2 million diamonds not only cost him his life, but he also put David at risk of losing him too. Ropsenlski wants to negotiate with David for the CD by having his ex-wife Liz talk to him about giving up, Rosnelski has made a deal to pay off his debts if he passes. David is later killed by Mexican actor Tony di Rosenliski, with the help of a great white shark, who does not let himself go to all these peaceful transactions by his boss. <br /> <br /> Tony took the CD that Liz left for his boss in a secure hotel and now wants to kill James, as he did with David, and at the same time hold the CD for something on Rosenlski. <br /> <br /> David who had secretly hidden the diamonds James had on him at the time of his murder is now the goal of Tony and his men to shut him up for good. David also wants to get the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that David's CD has been lost but use it later, without Rosenlski knowing who's behind it, blackmailing him. <br /> <br /> The movie "Night of the Sharks" has a series of shark attacks with this huge one-eyed white shark that ends up extracting about half a dozen cast members including Tony. David, who firmly believes in gun control, uses high-explosive knives and Molotov cocktails, in addition to his fists, to eliminate the entire Tony crew. Even the killer shark ended up out of Tony's but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it came to using firearms to save his friend and partner Paco, a girl, Juanita, and her priest, Father Mattia, lived with Tony and his guns were a no-no with David; he was more of a knife and a lance man, so anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the film was predictable, since you can do it with David who thought he was killed by the shark with one eye that later opens out of the crowd, after Rosenlski believed he was died and left the village. David continues his life as a free and loving beach lover with no one trying to kill him and about two million dollars richer. David's credit had his friend Paco giving Rosenski back his CD, but on condition that if anything happened to him his cousin, whom Rosenlski doesn't know who and where he is, shoots his mouth wide and lets the whole world know about his dirty and criminal business.
