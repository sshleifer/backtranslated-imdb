I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1 <br /> <br /> His story is very boring, and it has little to do with the original Timecop. Many things about Timecop have been demolished, and instead they have brought new nonsense. This story takes place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous: confused: <br /> <br /> And the action scenes are not happy at all, well, most part of them are not ... only the first is fantastic ... and there are not many action scenes and they are all rather short <br /> <br /> At some point in the story, the main character travels in time about 5 times in a few minutes ... no wait, do it twice ... <br /> <br /> In short: don't waste time watching this movie, it's not worth it
