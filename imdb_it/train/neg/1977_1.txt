Wait, don't tell me ... they threw the movie out and kept the footage out. You know, this movie could have been shot in an alley in New York. The "Gangster Bangster" I believe. Gangster Rap, a designer dressed as a gangster duster including a handkerchief that somehow moved from his neck to protect himself from dust storms to his head. I imagine it was to protect the head from filtering heat through the K-Mart hats. "Budget rent-a-horsie" apparently provided the horses. The scene of a bedroom in which the girl was talking and the guy was putting his words into his mouth ... I thought he was talking. You know, watching this movie confirms it, it's not about acting anymore ... it's about looks and it's about money. It couldn't be too much of what this movie is interested in. Well, all in all, I think this movie will go down as the worst movie ever. Just another thing, where was Ice T? Has he finally managed to go to Oprah?
