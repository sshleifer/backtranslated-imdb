If you can do it through "classic Meyer" titles, you can watch anything. But would you like? I didn't find much there to dig my teeth. I imagine that if you go with low expectations you will feel very happy (at the Charlie's Angels.) But for my money I would like a little more, more visual, more moving. More. I feel like I'm begging for food at the master's feet. the man took the goods but he simply will not share.
