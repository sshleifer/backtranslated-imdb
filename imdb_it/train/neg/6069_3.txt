It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor and put him aside in a film like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he couldn't save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually quite good, but I can't stand it when the actors do the same crap on more than one movie. I think it gets old, and this is the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising about this film, but then, the story was told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is the typical baseball player, and his presumption manifests itself in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this film is anything but fun. <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is IN this movie, this makes him a project if you are a fan (not a pun) that sees everything he does no matter how bad it is. But to see De Niro at its best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land", or even go back and check "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste time with this drivel. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
