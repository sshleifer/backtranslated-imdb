You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes is operating at half speed instead of at full speed in a movie, and "The Incubus" is a terrible scenario, at worst, of a great actor going through the motions to pay the bills . In fact, looking at Hammy's script and John Hough's "baroque" art direction, you can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a series of murders of rapes taking place in a small town, with a lot of supernatural hokum mixed up. Somehow, the management succeeds in sucking tension and interest from every scene, and Cassavetes seems visibly at times. The Incubus itself, which does not appear until the last scene, is a well-made creation, but it is not worth the wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
