The film is quite entertaining and engaging for about four dates, so it becomes a blatant advertisement for a guy who (and even his "friends") really can't stand. It's a pretty interesting concept; movie dates in a quest to find true love in the modern LA. The problem is that he feels incredibly (and badly) scripted at times and openly self-promoting. It is difficult to take care of and be involved in any of the characters, because the writer / actor is so selfish, unrefined, false and simply unpredictable. You end up feeling sorry for his dates.
