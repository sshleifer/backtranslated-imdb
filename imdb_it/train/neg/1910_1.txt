I tried to watch this so-called comedy, but it is very difficult to bear. This is an ugly, mean movie, full of clich√©s. Definitely not fun, but very boring and annoying, indeed. Bad script, bad acting. It's a complete waste of time - and I have nothing left to say, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> 1 on 10 points.
