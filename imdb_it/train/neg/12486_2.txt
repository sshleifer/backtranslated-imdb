The rich weasel Joan Winfield (a blameworthy unfortunate Bette Davis) is engaged to the stupid and selfish Allen Brice (Jack Carson seems lost). His father (Eugene Palette) is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney). Seriously. They crash into the desert and hate each other but (sighing) they start falling in love. <br /> <br /> It seems like I'm getting a high rating from reviewers here just because Cagney and Davis are in it. Both were brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT for comedy and this film shows why! The script is simply horrible - there is no real laugh in the whole film. The joke in this case is Cagney and Davis who fall on the rump first in a cactus (this is done THREE TIMES!). Only their remarkable talents save them from being completely humiliated. As they are both do their best with the bad material. Cagney does his best with his lines and Davis screams every line at full strength but it doesn't work. Carson has this "what the hell" look on his face throughout the entire movie (probably because his character emotions change in seconds). Only the palette with its distinctive voice and the highest readings manage to arouse some smile. But all in all, this was boring and without laughing - a real task to sit on. This one has two stars only for the acting of Cagney and Davis and some nice pictures but really - not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis have hated this movie over the next few years and you can see why.
