Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors) is slightly amused in this turkey from 1970, but the script is so disgusting and insulting that even Goldie Hawn's youth (immediately after his Oscar win) cannot begin to come up with this from mud. Like a celebrity who pursues her skirt in her 40s, Sellers is embarrassed especially at the nth degree. <br /> <br /> A 3 out of 10. Best return =? Nicky Henson plays a young kind of studio. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hawn and Sellers have been paid well, because I see no other reasons for this type of tripe in 1970 (a great year for the films - CATCH-22, MASH, MARITO, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and many others). You can't win them all!
