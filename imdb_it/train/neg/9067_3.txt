Although I had some hopes for this film, particularly since I like the acting of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I have to say that it was one of the worst films I've seen in recent memories (Loser and Dr T and women are also on that list). Yes, there were a few laughs aloud, even though the film could have been much better. The premise was not that the con artists that go through the college meet their meeting when they are discovered by someone with a proposal for them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikely, that I didn't care about any of them. The blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it wasn't fun to watch him - he wasn't unbalanced in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser, who was actually quite dangerous and not fun to watch. The editing of the film was difficult to follow - it continued to cut between fantasy and reality and often it was not clear what it was. Only two or three of the band's scams were really shown, you just have to believe that they were really scam artists ... showing their patterns would have made for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in reality it was stupid and poorly written and directed in everything. I could go on talking about the shortcomings of the film, but you have the idea. It is not worth the rental of $ 4 or the gas needed to drive to and from the movie store for rent!
