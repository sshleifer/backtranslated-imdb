Acting is horrible. This film makes an Academy Academy-winning film look like Fast and Furious. They throw some tits and butts to try to stay interested despite the EXTREMELY weak and unlikely story. There is a reason why people on the internet are not even downloading this movie. This film sank like an iron asshole. DO NOT waste your rental time or even download it. This film is and will always be a PERMA-TURD. I'm more stupid now for seeing it. In reality this title should be referred to as "PERMA-TURD" from now on. Calling it a film is a disguise and an insult. disgusting, abominable, terrifying, terrible, bestial, cruel, detestable, unpleasant, disgusting, terrible, disturbing, execrable, fairy, frightening, frightening, horrible, gloomy, horrible, macabre, atrocious, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible filthy, bad, disgusting, hateful, offensive, repulsive, repulsive, revolting, scandalous, frightening, shameful, shocking, wicked, terrible, terrifying, ungodly, ungodly, ungodly, unkind
