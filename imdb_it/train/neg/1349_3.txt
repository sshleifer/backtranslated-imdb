I got this DVD over 2 years ago and decided to watch it only yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long that I like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. Although it may have a bright color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated film, there are some old things that lack this gadget directly in the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all the classic theme of the Inspector Gadget the song and the music are completely absent. The composer tries to make compromises by making a score that sounds similar but is still not good enough. The mobile gadget is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. It also looks much nicer and more rounded instead of being simple. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain almost never make their appearance. <br /> <br /> The plot is non-existent. There is something in a transformation formula and Doctor Claw that he uses for an evil never revealed but it is all I got. What was the agreement with the Italian short film / giant that I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something to pass by, his last case is absolutely not in any way. And it remains in force therefore because it is called "last case" it is a mystery also. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but don't let it inspire you to purchase any Inspector Gadget DVD you can. I only sold it a few seconds after I finally saw it. No child will appreciate or appreciate this and no fan of the old show will tolerate it.
