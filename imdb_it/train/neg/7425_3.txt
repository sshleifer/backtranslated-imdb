This annoying and tiring Las Vegas casino robbery film is almost impossible to watch and engage. It is something that "looks" if you have absolutely nothing better to do. The only two decent things in this film are both fond of the beautiful Stella Stevens and a whole program that she spends hoping to fall from one of those little junk she wears. Many great shots of the Las Vegas of the '70s (when it was still a nice place to visit) and the fashions of the day are also good for a laugh. Otherwise, a big yawn. The Rhino DVD has a very good widescreen transfer but even in less than $ 10 it's not worth it in my humble opinion.
