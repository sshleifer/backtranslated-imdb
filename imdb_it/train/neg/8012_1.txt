As a lesbian, I'm always looking for movies about gays and lesbians. However, with this kind of crap out there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to happen - anything - a story to develop, or just for it to make some sense. Nor has it occurred. It was just meaningless scenes, unrelated to anything in any way. The film failed to convey any kind of story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I simply deactivated. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and he doesn't even deserve it.
