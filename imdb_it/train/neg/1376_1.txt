Of all the movies (and I'm a film graduate, if it's worth something to you), this is the best movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I haven't seen yet, but I've seen this, and that's the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. He talks about being young and retarded. You are not accredited! His role was incredibly small! How did he do it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in his filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and stuffed it inside the case. It reads something like "please, save your additional customers from having to see this complete and totally ugly movie!"
