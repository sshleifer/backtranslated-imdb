I wanted to see the film because of an article in a film magazine. It was not highly recommended by the critic. The plot is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hands. Directing and acting were terrible !! I had the feeling of seeing a movie that was created by a group of amateurs. Even though the film started off promising, it has been getting worse and worse. I think this is a non-original film with awkward characters. I still think it's worth looking at since I haven't seen movies subjected to gay porn. Don't keep your expectations high, so you'll be very disappointed. * outside *****
