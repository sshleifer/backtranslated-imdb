Sorry, but I'll ruin both the plot and the ending for you in the hope of avoiding a vacation fiasco like the one I'm facing. The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, ... and Santa Claus does it. Dad is peachy, happy healthy and totally unaware that he was dead. Everything ends with syrupy sweetness. <br /> <br /> But as a parent who recently saw my five year old son lose his best canine friend, it was a horror movie. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Don't underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was just a movie and his dog will NOT come back for Christmas. It was heartbreaking to see his joy only to know that on Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> Shame on behalf of all believers who have recently lost a loved one. It is quite difficult to deal with the loss once for a child, but there are some desires that we should not even represent as a possibility.
