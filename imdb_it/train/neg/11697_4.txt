I'm not one of those who think that King is a great writer, his books are distractions for a few hours, and often have interesting premises, however, in my opinion, they disintegrate quite quickly if you give him some serious thought. br /> <br /> This film suffers from a fairly precise reinterpretation of King's story. If you read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no alteration of scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans for King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a "gypsy curse" horror, with its twist being the curse that many people wish to become thinner. The last third has some serious structural problems, and the slightly forced finish seems to break the rules of this kind a little. <br /> <br /> There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life, but you may also read the book, because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
