This is by far one of the most boring and horribly recited accounts of the early days of Adolf Hitler that I have ever seen. Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but in Hitler's cast he is simply wrong. To launch Liev Schrieber as a longtime friend and help of Hitler, Haefengstal must have uttered cries of despair and anguish from the Simon Wiesenthal Center. A J-W playing a Nazi fan, a bad ugly casting casting. This was not a fun family movie with a good historical background. This was Hollywood garbage at its best, cashing in on the strength of a strong (but hardly used) cast of actors that seemed to have almost disappeared from the acting radar in the last 5 years. <br /> <br /> The fake German accents (see Vill vin zis var) offend the German people everywhere. My mother is German and she started smoking at the sound of voices that continued to pass from American / English / German all in the same sentence. The supporting cast makes better cardboard cutouts in the local video library than they do on the screen. Jenna Malone in the role of Geli Raubal, on the other hand, was splendid, she captured the innocence and confusion of this tragic young woman who eventually ended her life to escape her future as in Hitler's shadow. <br /> <br /> If you want an incredibly fantastic and historically accurate account of Hitler's early years of war / holocaust, rent 1983 "Inside the Third Reich" with Rutger Hauer as Albert Speer and Derek Jacobi in the role of Hitler. It was nice and made more sense then this baloney. <br /> <br /> As a historical researcher of the Third Reich I can honestly tell you that this led me to reach my books to confirm his myriad inaccuracies.
