I'm a huge, huge fan of John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson and Tony Shalhoub. I like Stephen King a little less, but I like some of his work. <br /> <br /> That being said, I should have LOVED 1408. <br /> <br /> *** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT **** <br /> <br /> I entered impatiently. I came out disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's not the actors' fault. Shalhoub and Jackson both have very small roles because the premise of the film puts Cusack in the "boy in a closed room" scenario. <br /> <br /> This was not a BAD movie, but I can't call it a good one. It was a confused mess that had moments of "ouch, it's just WRONG", combined with moments of "ouch, it's just painful", and moments of "oh, now it's just unlucky" with little continuity-connectivity between them. Eislin's father shows up once, and there is no apparent connection with the rest of Mike's personal life that we see displayed as he tries to survive in the room. <br /> <br /> A previous commentator described the Olin / Enslin argument as worthy of being seen, and I very much agree. But apart from that, apart from a few clever musical cues (the room almost jokes Enslin a little, and gives him a chance to get out before he gets up ... at that point he gives him an hour countdown and the main line of the Carpenters "We have Only Just Begun." is mostly "stuff that jumps you when you least expect it!" horror type that was fun when I was fourteen and surrounded by friends my age, who huddled together in the summer while Jason chased Camp Crystal Lake. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film was "Let us relive some of his most painful experiences" mindgaming, with "let's animate the paintings in a gruesome way" clich√© cheesiness. <br /> <br /> ****** END SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> I expected better from this movie with the name of Stephen King attached to it, as well as the actors which I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> We never discover the origin of evil. We can never see the wicked defeated, although we can assume he was defeated. <br /> <br /> And the ending was just a jarring "What ?!" moment. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to arrive by cable. I wouldn't mind paying for this as a matinee, but I feel a little discouraged for paying the opening prices at night for this.
