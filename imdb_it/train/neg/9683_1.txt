I'm giving this pretentious piece of junk a 1 simply because I don't think there's a worse movie in the world. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, setting, writing and directing. I hope that everyone involved in this movie will burn and rot in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Damn this lousy waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this film is just a figment of my imagination. I pray that I dreamed of the film, and that I will never have to see it again at my local video store. <br /> <br /> BURN IN HELL
