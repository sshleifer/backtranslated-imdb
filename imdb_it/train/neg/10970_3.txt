This is absurd - apart from the Australian colleague who reviewed this film, I can't help thinking that all the others who have submitted a review so far have somehow been involved in Elektra's production, considering how generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I'm not a real fan of conversions from comics to movies, so I didn't have many expectations, however I found Elektra incredibly irresistible. The thing that bothered me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this movie that went unexplained, that left you thinking "eh, what does this plot matter?" or "how did that aspect of the character come about?" I can only hope that these are things that are perhaps explained in some way in Daredevil, which I am not going to see. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the behavior of the characters in this film seems to make a change at random moments to adapt to the plot, and not even let me start on the utterly useless romantic subplot. I'm also (still) scratching my head about the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, who seems to have gone unexplained. <br /> <br /> If I can give compliments to this film for all that should be the fantastic places where it was filmed, but otherwise I gained little entertainment from Elektra. I know we should suspend disbelief for fantasy / action films, but almost everything in this film was so unlikely or confusing (even by action movie standards) that it simply frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good.
