I find myself wondering what the people who gave us a 10 did that I didn't do. This film has a VERY difficult time to follow and / or stay in a storyline. If someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's 98% of odd dramas and 2% of comedy. All the actors turn into a great performance, which cannot be denied, however it seems that it has really lost something somewhere. I don't know if the original script was good and had to be modified or what. This had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like the hour and a half invested in this film, but the video rental does not return in time. Save your money and see something else.
