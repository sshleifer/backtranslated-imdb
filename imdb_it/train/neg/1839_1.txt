I couldn't wait to put this film in my DVD player when I rented it. Then, after starting it, I couldn't wait to get it out of my DVD player. I actually watched the whole movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something fun to happen, but nothing fun ever. The box said how fun it would be. The premise of the film looks good. Ben Stiller is fun. Black jack is fun. How could this movie be missing? Well .... we miss it! This is the most ruthless "comedy" I've ever seen. No one I spoke to thought he was even slightly funny. It's just a really lame movie. Trust me. Avoid it .... AVOID IT!
