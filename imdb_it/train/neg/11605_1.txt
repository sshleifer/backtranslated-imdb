At first glance the slogan of the plot I thought could be a decent movie. Could I ever have been more wrong? The beginning of the film makes it seem that a group of monsters has joined and decided to make a low-cost film. For the first 10 minutes you don't notice the acting of the genre, the horrible sound and the terrible special effects, but it gets worse. At about 20 minutes I was wondering, "What was the plot again?" I could just ask that question when I wasn't busted laughing at the simple lameness of this movie. The main actor has an environment for emotions and adheres to the whole film, although he would have had to go through love and hatred and all that is intermediate. The flashback scene almost made me throw up because it made me relive an extra minute of previous footage in the movie. Now we have arrived at the center of the film, where they are obviously trying to snatch Morpheus from "The Matrix", even if he is only doing a horrible job. The actor is talking about "Star Wars" and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now at the end of the film you don't realize it's the end of the film because you think the plot is finally developing. The character of "Morpheus" dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie. Speak two words and the roll of credits. What is this? No plot, bad acting, cheese all could not be worse. Please, if you appreciate human decency, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!
