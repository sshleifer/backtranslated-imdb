I bet Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear. Isn't it too clever for Gene to switch to the women's team and then jump on his sword? And big pussy? What the hell was that "look at me, I'm a mouse!" double shit episode? All those clich√©s about the mafia, BOTH! The big names voted have already received money for their charity and have obtained a customized customized exit. Hmm ... This is not reality but the drama staged! Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor", also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay staged his departure, when he clearly had little time before his baby was born. <br /> <br /> Yuk!
