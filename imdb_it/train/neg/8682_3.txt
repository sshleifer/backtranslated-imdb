I want to start by saying that I'm a Republican, even if I don't agree with many of the things that Bush did in the office. And I love the daily show and Colbert's report. They must be two of my favorite TV shows. I like the bush jokes about Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy who ever walked the earth (I also think he's not the stupidest). But it comes to a point where it's enough and that's not so much fun. I see where it can be fun and it's (hey is making fun of our authority figure, it's hilarious.). But the central comedy is only trying to draw attention to him. I mean maybe a special episode, but an entire series is simply stupid. It seems that CC is saying the same jokes about the bush that we have heard WAY many times. I really can't see this show going on after 1 season.
