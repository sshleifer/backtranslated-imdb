Making the film as dark and visually blurry as possible in order to cover budget shortfalls is a strategy often used in low-budget horror films, but this takes it too far.

The filmmakers are launching different (not original) horror ideas without any semblance of logic, and halfway there is the feeling of having almost abandoned the effort to make a good horror film; you know when you see characters that should be in mortal danger (or, on some occasions, even dead) make small talk ...
