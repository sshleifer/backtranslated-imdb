I'm not sure why this film was advertised as a wild, wacky and laughter comedy. There is not much in this film that will entertain or amuse the viewer. Annette Bening (whose acting was advertised as worthy of an Oscar) appears here as a mannered, with her seemingly routine performances. The character of Brian Cox is confused and irritating, and the protagonist is Augusten ?? Joseph Cross ?? he simply seems not to have the personality to play his role. The best thing about the movie is Evan Rachel Wood, but it's not enough to support this boring and unpleasant film. <br /> <br /> The film has disappeared quickly and seems to be right. I found some disgusting scenes (the scene with Brian Cox and his hygienic review just used some of the worst scenes in "You and Me and Everyone We Know" and "The Squid and the Whale"), some embarrassing and most of them scary . I found the whole experience a waste of time. Do not waste time?
