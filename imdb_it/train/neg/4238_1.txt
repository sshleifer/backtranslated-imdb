This movie is terrible. Eventually you will realize that many hours have been stolen from your life that you cannot go back. The "twist" finish is very elaborate. The development of the character that leads to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation, with the premise that Rob Lowe's character will die on Christmas Eve, is explained in ninety seconds "No, we were just deceiving you". So Rob Lowe's character isn't even angry about it! "I will forgive you if you can forgive me," he is as shocked as he is. If someone took weeks to convince me that I was going to die and then I said "No, I'm sorry, I'm just kidding you" I would like to make a serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching. Please save yourself and DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.
