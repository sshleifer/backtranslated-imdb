The acting was bad, the script was ugly and the ending was simply terrible ... the only good comment I could have made about this film would have been special effects and makeup ... but other than that ... this movie it would have been one of the worst films of 2001 ... because they never had to redo a movie so perfect and ruin it ... because !!!!
