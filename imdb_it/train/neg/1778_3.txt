I have nothing against a frantic film of fear, but this nonsense derived from Stephen King is too fresh, too bright and modern. The plot, about a new teenager in a small town that is a "sleepwalker" - a sort of cross between a vampire and a werewolf - and that feeds on the blood of female virgins, begs for a more mysterious and ambiguous treatment. This thriller has an improperly colored appearance and appearance, with very little atmosphere. The boys are predictably beautiful and energetic, but the big advantage is Alice Kridge as the boy's mother; Kridge, from "Ghost Story", never came out of the female filling mold, and it's a huge loss that hasn't been used anymore. His performance is disturbing and intense, and suggests that "Sleepwalkers" may have been a much better film with a different focus and a narrower direction. It's too exaggerated and market-driven, with an irregular tone that fluctuates wildly from the thriller to the comedy to the drama. Stephen King appears in a cameo, as do real life directors John Landis and Tobe Hooper. * 1/2 from ****
