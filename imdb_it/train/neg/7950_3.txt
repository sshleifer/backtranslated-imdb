Cafe Lumiere is a magnificently photographed nerd. Not knowing the director's work, I know the director he is supposedly paying tribute to - Ozu Yasujiro. While not approaching Ozu in greatness, Hou did not communicate anything about the depth of Ozu's emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space. One of the things he completely misses is the attention to Ozu's character - we're not even "presented" by Hou to his main character (a perfect blank page). There are no average or close shots of his people. One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us exactly what Hou doesn't - a good look at their faces. <br /> <br /> There was a great Spanish Bardem movie called Nunca Pasa Nada, which translates to something like "Nothing Ever Happens". It would be a much better title for this useless exercise. Throughout the film, clues are given about an obscure Taiwanese composer, some of whose works we hear on the soundtrack. But the clues, like everything else, add up to nothing. Unless you are a railway worker, this film has nothing to recommend.
