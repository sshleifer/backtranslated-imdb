The beginning of the 1990s brought many independent "eccentric" and "off-beat" films, a particular subgenre of which is the semi-spiritual movie of the crime of the desert. Other notes are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk Til Dawn" and, to some extent, "Natural Born Killers". Good films like those have generated garbage like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this inept anti-surreal masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It is a comedy that aims at a certain emotional tone, reaches it, but continues to go to the point of irritation. While the pursuit through the spirit-world of the desert and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good detective movie, and is not focused enough on laughter to really be a comedy. I won't blow the ending, but let's just say it's ugly. The film is basically a bad side effect of cancer like that. This is the scum of indie-mania.
