Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this film. It barely keeps us. Most of the time on the screen is dominated by little funny jokes. A running gag is that a character is called Jerk Off. There are also many erection bars, where the punch line is someone who has an erection. This film is as entertaining as Kirstie Ally's British accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This film started as a weak action movie: five minutes of back story and then bam! Not funny jokes. But, apart from the terrible writing, the film is also badly directed and the acting is terrible. Furthermore, this film makes the old clich√© of the bad comedy of having many well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people who spend more time on Rodney's screen, even though he is advertised as the main character. Don't be surprised to find this movie in a pharmacy that sells for five dollars. That too is too much.
