This was the worst movie I've ever seen Billy Zane. I understand that this film was mainly to show newcomers, who did very well for newcomers, but above all, the film was not credible. <br /> <br /> With all the shots, you'd think the police would intervene. Even the coin is a bug on Sean he was stupid. The way Sean suddenly realizes that the coin is the insect was not realistic. <br /> <br /> It looks like this movie was slapped quickly. Poor work Get a better writer. <br /> <br /> The countdown to the end was not synchronized with anything. It took longer to fight. And what a coincidence that every time Billy blew up Sean, he would be left without bullets. Once, I can believe it, but not twice. <br /> <br /> Actually, Billy's character was stupid. It was so stupid when Sean hit him in the end. It was like a comedy. Bad! Bad! Bad!
