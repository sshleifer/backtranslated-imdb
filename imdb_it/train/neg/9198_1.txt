There are people out there who will highlight something! This is the only explanation I can offer about why the movie House of the Dead exists. And this is just a scary part of the whole movie. It's so bad you will go away forever. I seriously wanted to turn it off and turn on the TV on the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer it all. I don't know why I do these bad things to myself. <br /> <br /> As if it were important, here is the fundamental part of "history". A group of twenty-year-olds is so desperate to go to some island in the Pacific Northwest (actually in Canada because it's cheap) for the "Rave of the Century" (which consists of about 8 people and unenthusiastic music) that they pay some old $ 1000 cadet fisherman to take them there after losing the main ferry. It must be a rave to deserve all that dough! The fisherman warns them that the island is also known as the Isle of the Dead (wait - I thought it was HOME of the Dead?) And that they were all condemned yadda yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> First mistakes here. Why a small rave (of my century my foot!) Should it be kept on some remote island? Why would anyone pay a lot of money to get it? Why pay even more to the old fisherman to bring them back when they could return with the others? <br /> <br /> Once they arrive they discover that the rave (which consists of about 2 tents, a small stage and a port-a-john) has been destroyed, there is blood everywhere and no one is around . What would a person think rationally do? Run for their lives, of course. But no, these clueless people, obviously blind, decide to go look for them. They soon discover an old ramshackle house that is 50 times bigger inside and outside. Another half-hour of stumbling through the forest follows, as an excuse to kill some of the minor characters, and after so much den they return home again. The characters, like the movie, don't go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Hurry up in this terrible disaster is an overabundance of meaningless dialogues, hateful acting, mumbo-jumbo exposition and zillion of arcade game clips once popular name itself. Because this has been universally accepted as a good idea with the directors I will never know. The clips have no reference to any of the scenes and further degrade this garbage, if possible. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the game, except for a few economic end lines. Resident Evil looks like a cinematic glory. Hell, even the Double Dragon movie seems more worthy of an Oscar than this junk. The only one who comes out of this with his still intact dignity is Jurgen Prochnow. He could just take his money and run, but he does his best with the horrible script and brings a bit of pathos to his character. The rest of the cast sucks, I'm afraid. The characters are idiots and deserve to die. <br /> <br /> Also, if you cut the nudity swear and useless, I don't see why this film cannot be shown on Saturday morning on TV. It's not scary in the slightest. Pirates of the Caribbean is scarier than the skeletal villains in this movie. And where do all the bad guys come from? There were only a few people on the island to begin with. I imagine this justifies why they chose to reuse the movie over and over again. I'm not kidding, you'll see the same zombie die a dozen times. <br /> <br /> Who is ultimately to blame for that outrageous celluloid waste? Nothing less than the director Uwe Boll. His control over the film is non-existent. You can clearly see that the actors have no idea what they should do and that the zombies are not really taking everything seriously. The actors seem to be reading the cues as they constantly stop in the middle of long sentences and keep talking as soon as they see the next card. Everything seems very unnatural. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film is shot as a two-part mini-series. I've really seen better TV productions. And don't let me start assembly. The film is an incoherent babble with thousands and thousands of useless shots and dozens of nonsensical cameras. No real skill or talent has been put into doing this. It is really disconcerting and upsets the mind of how movies can be made so terribly bad and George A. Romero can't even convince anyone to answer his calls. House of the Dead makes a little idiotic reference to Romero in a lazy attempt to be "postmodern" but it's just irritating to think that this is in the same league as a real zombie movie. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the anamorphic image of 1.85: 1 is excellent and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unclear and only serves to pronounce the heavily overused ADR even more. The DVD includes extras, but why torture yourself. Is this warning not enough? Stay away! You are all doomed, I tell you! Condemned! Condemned!!!
