Jet Li, is one of the best hand-to-hand combat fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and has put others to shame in the genre. While it is large in Asia, it is almost unknown here in the United States. Black Mask should be a hit movie for him, but fails horribly. First of all, he is nicknamed. Although it may have a field value (dubbing is not even close and has a flat tone), it seems inappropriate for the normal viewer of the film. Secondly, the director of this film, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. Cut the scenes so quickly, sometimes, you don't know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and swings. Fans see the films of Jet Li for fantastic martial arts. However, the director modifies the scenes so quickly that you don't even know who's who half the time! Other times, a scene is left suspended (ie Li is starting to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the bad guys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely that they go through the whole point of being completely ridiculous (murder CD-ROMs? From the only launching stars !!!!). Li needs a director less inclined to machine-gun cutting and more to the creation of a mise-a-scene film. The added rap / techno music goes from being ok to intrusive. The plot has possibilities, but they are all wasted by cartoonists who take away all the credibility that this film seeks. And do we really believe that love interest wouldn't recognize Simon, because he has half a mask? Wouldn't your hair, jaw or voice give it to you? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or its classic Shaolin Temple. This disjointed mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
