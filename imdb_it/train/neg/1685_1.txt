All children between the ages of 14 and 16 want to watch this film (even if they are only admitted at 18). They've heard it's a very scary movie and they feel so good when they watch it. I feel very sad because children can't see what a good movie is, and what a bad movie it is. This was one of the worst movies I've seen in months. Every scene you see in this film is a copy of another film. It's the end? It's an open ending ... why? Because it is impossible to find a good decent for such a stupid story. This movie is made to scare you, and if you're a little crafty and you know a little bit of music, you know exactly when you'll be scared. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, I turned to my friend and told him (a bit noisy) that it was a total waste of money, a stupid child seemed strange to me. Today I could do an Oscar with a home video of my goldfish, if I will only use the right marketing.
