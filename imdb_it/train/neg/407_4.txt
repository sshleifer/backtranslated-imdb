I love special effects and witness the new technologies that make science fiction real. The special effects of this film are very good. I've seen most of this movie, since it's aired on HBO in the last two months. I have to admit that maybe I missed some scenes, but I'm usually attracted to movies and I've seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see "Hollow Man", I feel depressed, almost like a "film noir". I'm not sure why; maybe it's that I don't want Kevin Bacon to be bad, and there's disappointment in this. But I think he witnesses how relentlessly evil becomes. Regardless, I can recommend this film for excitement (even if some parts move slowly), but I do NOT recommend it for young people under the age of 14 (maybe 12, if they are mature).
