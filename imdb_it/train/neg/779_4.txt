Seriously, I mean very seriously, when I started watching the show I thought it was nice. But the plots are worse. The plot was too dull or predictable. George is not always fun, sometimes he behaves stupidly. His jokes are exaggerated. His mother is the most foolish character in the show. How can a mother treat her son that way, ok if she was the daughter-in-law, but this was her own son. I give this show at 4/10 just because the first shows were a little fun. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job. I don't know how these shows can play so long. <br /> <br /> If you're really bored like me and you have nothing else to look at, I'd suggest you watch it.
