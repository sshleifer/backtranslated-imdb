Maybe I'm not up to date or just don't know how Electra is in current publications ... But the Elettra I read was much more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. He usually used others to do his dirty work and more often than it was implied by some sort of double crossing. Just when you think you understand everything, pull the wool over your eyes and make your way. <br /> <br /> This film was quite weak on the dialogue, the acting was not particularly convincing, and the action was questionable. I was really looking for something more along the lines of the Frank Miller book "Electra Assassin". Which is much darker than anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect where cool, the action was interesting sometimes, but most of the time the plot and plot were slow or illogical. Tha Hand wasn't threatening enough, and Electra wasn't ... bitchy enough. She's the girl you love to hate ... but in this story, I didn't care at all.
