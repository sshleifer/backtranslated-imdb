This film presents Ben Chaplin as a bored bank employee in England who orders a mail order bride from Russia, receives Nicole Kidman by mail and gets more than he bargained for when, surprise, it is not what it appears to be. The story is quite predictable and Chaplin underestimates too much to the point of becoming quite anxious. Kidman is pretty good at this role, making his character the only thing in this movie that is interesting. GRADE: C
