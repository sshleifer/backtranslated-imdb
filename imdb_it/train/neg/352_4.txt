It seems that the cast should guarantee at least an average film. And so I sat for 102 minutes of disbelief. Next to Ed Harris, nobody seems to possess the skills of acting. Even Sean Connery, who I normally love, must have had a day off during the filming of Just Case. Not once during the entire film, an actor convinced me. <br /> <br /> This has made this film an economic and unreal movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a bit complex. It's electrifying, and the plot is unexpected. <br /> <br /> Conclusion just look at this movie if you really have nothing more useful to do.
