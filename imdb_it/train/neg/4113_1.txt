I have to finish watching a movie when I start, no matter how bad it is. This film was distressing to sit down. The "glittering" bullets, the journalist with "ninja" moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and seem to hit only innocent spectators, the predictable result and all the bad acting was simply horrible. Like the girl who finds the journalist in her friends apartment and goes by "what the hell are you doing here (holding a bat)" to "hey, you're cute, you want @ # $%! ???" in about 1.2 seconds .... Only ugly ... Save an hour and forty minutes and go play with your children (or dog)!
