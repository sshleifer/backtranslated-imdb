There are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this has some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don't "understand" it. Obviously this means we should stick to Hollywood waste. <br /> <br /> In the book there is every artistic clich√©, ad-hem, I think it's good that the director is one of the few chosen. Almost a car parody that drowns in its own claim. <br /> <br /> The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) film "Ratcatcher" returns with another piece that moves in an artistic absurdity; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study on alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating to its viewers.
