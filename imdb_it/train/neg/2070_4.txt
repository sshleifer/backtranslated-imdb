After too many memories, I decided to skip this episode whenever it appeared in the second season sequence. I just watched it recently to remind me why. I have always considered this the worst episode of ST: TNG (except for "Shades of Gray", which barely counts as an episode). <br /> <br /> I continue to listen to the dialogue and the clumsy thought of the script written in pencil by the author of the author's Writing 101: "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" From the declaration of Deanna Troi, and the constant reminder of everyone's elbows about what is an enchanting and dangerous Okona rogue, to Guinan's explanation of how funny his droids joke is (he's not), who cares about conflict resolution, there is no point in the plot that is not highlighted and triple emphasized for our edification, and there is no credible moment in any of them. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a fascinating actor in other circumstances, is too much of a dog to be the center of the plot machinations. On the other hand, it could be that no one less than John Barrowman (Jack Harkness of "Doctor Who") could draw from this placeholder subscribed to a role. <br /> <br /> (Zero points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work on here, even though Jerry's piece Lewis was stupidly funny.) <br /> <br /> good day, you might be able to think of this as a small tribute to an episode of minor original series. I'd rather jump to "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
