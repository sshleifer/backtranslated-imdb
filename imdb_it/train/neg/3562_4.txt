"Indian burial site": if those three words appear anywhere in a real estate ad, look for a different neighborhood. A young couple with a young daughter and a newborn child move to a Maine home adjacent to a pet cemetery and, after an excursion to an o-o-o-ng, an ancient Indian cemetery. It seems that Indian soil can bring back Fido or Fluffy from the dead - if you don't mind having a hell beast for a pet. He can do the same for the dead - if you don't mind having a murderous zombie around the house. <br /> <br /> Throw a busy two-lane asphalt, speeding up the big rigs, a well-meaning (if a little weak) old neighbor, and a child who doesn't have enough supervision, and I think you can figure out what it happens from there - an exaggerated, illogical mess that, in all honesty, offers a bit of fear. <br /> <br /> Well, there are worse adaptations of Stephen King (like "Maximum Overdrive", which King also directed). But there are also much better ones (like "Salem's Lot", "The Dead Zone" and both versions of "The Shining").
