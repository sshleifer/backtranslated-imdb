Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film. There is a good story here about the Axis trying to get the coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we are dealing with an apparently botched Boyer. By the way, Bacall is English like Vladimir Putin. <br /> <br /> The real acting successes go to Oscar-winning veteran Katina Paxinou. As in the case of his memorable Pilar in 1943, winner of the Oscar, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", Paxinou once again plays a Spanish revolutionary, but this time he is a double-cross spy for the pro-franc group. She is quite a vicious character here, especially when she throws a 14-year-old boy out the window. He believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.
