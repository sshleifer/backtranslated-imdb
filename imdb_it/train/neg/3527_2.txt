I had to see it because it seemed like a big frightening premise - the prisoners who found the magic book, oo err! it follows the claustrophobic terror, etc. <br /> <br /> but there doesn't seem to be a story to follow with the great idea. rather than chilling / psychological horror, he relied on the effects in the open fire and the horror of the OTT body, which did not frighten you at all if your outdated 12. <br /> <br /> The logic in the end is ridiculous, with the characters killed for nothing but the body bill. waste of good characters - that was the best thing about this movie. <br /> <br /> obviously low budget, which doesn't hurt, the film is not going anywhere, and I think I'll say it - it needs a Hollywood remake. you simply lose interest in this version. certainly not in the same league as other French films released in recent years like the crimson rivers that were at least watchable / entertainable, the male is not watchable to the end to be honest. and I bet you can guess the ending before seeing the movie. really really disappointing, impossible to recommend.
