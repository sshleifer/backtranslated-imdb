Randolph Scott leaves the United States for the greener pastures of British Columbia in Canada. He wants to start a ranch with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They flee their small herd on a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracture. <br /> <br /> From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott produced a series of themed westerns for adults, some of which are considered true classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns. <br /> <br /> It is more similar to the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry could use. History is definitely silly at times. Williams, who was traveling with Scott, wanted to go in search of gold because there was a big strike at that time. He does not blame the thieves, he blames Scott for having persuaded him to make the trip because of the loss of his arm. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are captured by the Indians. They run away because Gabby's mule has been taught to give the command and he kicks off the Indians allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure he would have played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the story really wants you to believe that tyrant seeker Randolph Scott stumbles across a gold strike after only a few lessons from prospect Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was part of Gabby Hayes' farewell movie. It would have been better if he had gone out in a good western and in fact had made a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before that. <br /> <br /> I'll say it, although no Caribou has made any appearance in the film, this is one of the few local Canadian films of the past that had NO Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you if you're not a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour from The Cariboo Trail.
