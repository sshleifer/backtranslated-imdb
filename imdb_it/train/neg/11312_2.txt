This film deserves credit for its original approach. Combines elements of theater, film and epic narratives. Unfortunately, it falls flat on all levels. The main weakness of the film is its reluctance to engage in anything; it has sampled, moralistic and epic elements without ever engaging in any of them. As for the story itself, Chretien de Troyes turns in his grave to this horrible adaptation that turns Percival into an inflexible and unbearably innocent chival. <br /> <br /> Most likely two types of people will see this, francophiles or arthiophiles. Speaking as one of the latter, I found the film unwatchable and an incredibly run down and disrespectful of a good story.
