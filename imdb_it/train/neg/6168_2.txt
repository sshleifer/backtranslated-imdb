Hmm, IMDb rating of 7.5, good comments, blah, blah ... okay, two of my friends and I, we ordered Pizza, sat down and wanted to see something cool like Ichi or at least something mindless but fun like Versus. But Naked Blood has sucked. It's a complete waste. Ok, the scene with the woman who likes to eat is truly exceptional. But it is so. Nothing more, nothing less. I don't want to ecstasy about the plot, other people have already done it, I just wanted to stop the advertising. But look and evaluate for yourself. Perhaps we can push the evaluation where it should be. Another thing that comes to mind: the soundtrack is even worse than Carpenter ever was - ok, John is cool ... :) 2/10
