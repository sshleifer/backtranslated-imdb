Being a director myself, and possessing a rather obscure and subversive sense of humor, I thought I would get a surprise when I brought home "My Wrongs ..." (not that the DVD cover gives away something, opting for instead for the ambiguous quote from the controversial director, Chris Morris, "a short film that includes scenes"). I should have known better, and avoided this tasteless (and often offensive) piece of tweed. <br /> <br /> The scene in the church is repugnant to watch (especially since we know Morris's distorted attitude towards pedophilia from his infamous TV series, Brass Eye) all too well and has no other purpose than that to shock. How this film is labeled as a comedy that I will never understand. <br /> <br /> The runner's comment sounds like a new idea in principle (being a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the film production process), however this is unfortunately not the case here . Instead, we are treated by some public schoolchildren who talk about dogs on film, before concluding that there are really no great movies starring dogs. All this is very interesting, but not a single celluloid frame. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is not going anywhere would be an understatement. He relies too heavily on his enhanced style, to the detriment of the plot, character and dialogue, leaving the viewer strangely upset and dissatisfied. His message too simplified - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is at the same time glaring and poorly illustrated. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but in the end it fails to convince, to entertain, to illuminate and ends up being irritating. If you want to see a really great piece of short films, I strongly recommend "The love of Franz Kafka is a wonderful life", by Peter Capaldi.
