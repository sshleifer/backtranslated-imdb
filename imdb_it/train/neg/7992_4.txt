I remember watching this movie a long time ago on television. I remember that the premise of the film concerned a group of hotel occupants who were being attacked by man-eating ants. What I didn't remember was WHAT WAS FANTASTIC !!! <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existence and are never found again! Suzanne Somers (at the peak of her career playing Chrissy in "Three's Company") plays to a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Construction workers are installing a swimming pool outside and accidentally disturbing an ant's nest. Or should I say, a * NEST * OF ANIMAL MANIANS * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by ants. One minute takes them apart one by one, the minute after it is covered. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was rather unlikely, you should see Myrna Loy play a wheelchair user who is transported by air from the Manor by helicopter! I could almost imagine her thinking with relief that she was transported by air from the movie! <br /> <br /> The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third boy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with his back to each other, blowing through the straws and covered in ants. <br /> <br /> This is basically the movie. There is really no "disastrous" or "big star" appeal for the film. It was supposed to be a "large scale" television event at the time. Now, it's lucky if it's downloaded in the 4:00 clock time slot at the local TV station. <br /> <br /> If you want to capture Suzanne Somers at her best, then watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy do anything to put bread on the table and pay the bills, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
