The first point that draws attention to "For Ever Mozart" is the absence of a plot summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there is no story, script, storyline or anything that can remind the minimum structure of a film. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most exaggerated and pretentious film industry directors and this useless crap is among his most hermetic films. I believe neither of them understood what this story is about; but there are intellectuals who can speculate to justify or explain this messed up film, and it's fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My vote is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
