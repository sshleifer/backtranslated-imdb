This so-called "documentary" tries to say that the US simulated the landing of the moon. Right year. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has actually studied the case knows otherwise. <br /> <br /> First of all: there is certainly a proof. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought MANY kilos of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These have been spread around the world to hundreds of laboratories, which have tested them. And all concluded that they came from the same planet, not from the earth: because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth, but similar to those calculated to be on the moon. OSSIA conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only take the thing that is part of their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another misconception is that theirs was wind in the hangar where they fired at the moon landing, IE the flag moves. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, then he moved. And what this proves: well, if conspiracy theorists would also study the video, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has left it, I.E. conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they don't really study a topic, or they study it only until they have what they came for, so they can lie and make a profit (ie this so-called "documentary"). <br /> <br /> A claim states that it is not possible that they were shot on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different light sources, artificial lighting coming from the studio. Once again conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in a terrestrial desert at night, without light sources. But I doubt any Conspiracy theorist has ever been out of the basement of their grandmothers for more than a few days at a Star Treck convention. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists deny, GREAT TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they invent all these lies to seem important - this is a fact.
