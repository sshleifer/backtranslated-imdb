Oh dear ... like an Englishman, and a small Welsh part, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the field ..... to date, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> See that I am no one, that I was hoping for something better. So my comments are like "straw in the wind". But that's the point isn't it? - I have no ax to grind on the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the unwashed large, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. Yes, suspend convictions for a short time. But not to enter a state of total disbelief. <br /> <br /> If you had been an unknown author and director, I imagine that this "production" would have been punished by the by-products. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and I was left wide-eyed and confused. Having seen some of the rave reviews given to this work, I am vaguely worried .... <br /> <br /> Maybe it's that I try, without prejudice, to see every movie for its merits. Regardless of author, director, studio or even the reputation of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, like many before me: do not write and direct the same production. It is full of dangers. Films must be moderated to maintain a semblance of credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in school reports "It could and can do better ..."
