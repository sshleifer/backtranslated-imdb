This film was super smart. It's a theme that rhymes with every single horror film ever made. Valentine makes ZERO try to be original. What is Valentine's Day anyway? It is a group of people who give each other the same lame messages that were given to the same people a year earlier. There is nothing original about Valentine's Day. <br /> <br /> I only saw him once, and in that vision here are some of the movies he ripped. 1.Prom Night 2.Carrie 3.Scream 4. Any other horror movie in which someone is killing someone. <br /> <br /> I know there is more, but my mind was slowly turning into a puddle of silk I could not grasp them as quickly as they arrived. <br /> <br /> Valentino didn't have the chance to be a good movie. How come every horror film must have a "surprise" killer, people who don't care because their emotions take a turn at each other. One minute a good girl turns into an evil B - ch, so she is an insecure woman, and so on and son. <br /> <br /> Normally any horror film (in my book) can be saved from blood, once again Valentine does not have this. It was as if they were trying to make it PG-13, but they couldn't, so they left the change. <br /> <br /> Don't see this excessive inspiration, a rip-off unless you hate yourself and you want to die. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
