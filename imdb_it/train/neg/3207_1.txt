Oh my God it was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This film takes itself too seriously ... unless, of course, they intended to be funny. I saw him last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the whole audience was laughing at every scene. I think my favorite was "you shouldn't be studying medicine at Oopsalof"! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram the single phrase of the character of Nicalo "we'll be together ... it's our destiny". I'm sorry but after the first time, words have lost all meaning. <br /> <br /> And what was with the apple? <br /> <br /> I recommend it as a lesson for Americans: you can't animate, so please don't try. You are just embarrassed.
