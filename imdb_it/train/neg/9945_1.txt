After seeing about half of this film I noticed something strange ... I found myself constantly passing through the TV channels to see what else there is - not exactly a good cinematographic feature. <br /> <br /> This film is listed as being in a number of genres, and I have to say that it mostly failed miserably in all of them. 80% of the film passed to me to watch an old rerun instead. In short, the whole film seemed as if those who did it didn't know exactly what to do and ended up in a concoction with no perceptible taste.
