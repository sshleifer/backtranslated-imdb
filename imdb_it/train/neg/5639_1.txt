I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I imagine the critics were just sucking Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It's certainly the slowest movie I've ever seen in numerous useless and ridiculously long scenes. In addition to Defoe who was decent, the acting of two and a half other people in the film, including Defoe's wife, Jade, was ridiculously horrible (the way they launched the bakery part of the order is beyond me ). This film is practically one less storyline with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that aroused any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nothing, as if it were just to add a sort of shock to the stupidity of this movie. Sorry for being so hard, but in reality this film is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good independent cinema, but this film is not worthy of film buffs.
