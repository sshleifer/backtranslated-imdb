"Dutch Schultz", AK Arthur Fleggenheimer, was a real person and his rather ugly life is quite well documented. This film, which purports to represent his life, should have used a fictional character, because the events that are overshadowed are too strong to distance themselves from facts and chronology. Not only that, it ignores some interesting details that other versions have included, such as the fiasco of public relations in the north of the state of New York and its religious conversion. It is true that he was executed by Luciano, Lansky, et. to the. but this is how far away. The explosive scene of the slab that represents Luciano performing Bo Weinberg's performance in his own home, assisted by his mother, is ridiculous. Also, there is the scene where the Dutch approaches his mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond. It just doesn't work. Not even the character of Mrs Fleggenheimer works. This film does not need an adorable Jewish mother for a comic relief. The limping representation of Legs Diamond was quite humorous. I'm sure the man is turning in his grave. And, by the way, the Dutchman actually killed the people, but it wasn't Rambo or 007. The scene in which he sweeps the brewery away is absurd. I do not know. Maybe it had to be a comedy and I didn't understand it.
