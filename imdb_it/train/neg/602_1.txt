Yet another example of the complete waste of UK lottery money. Exactly as the commercial film showed. The Film Council, which has financed this miserable garbage, should be stranded, on one of the disused stations of the London underground, to allow this clich√©, a sad example of dedicating itself to the cinema, a half mutant thing made up of all the films of the horror that the director saw and felt fit to imitate, particularly Deathline. Among his many sins is the obvious inability to make the main character likeable until the last minute. It's a little too late then! Surely all those development executives at the UK Film Council could have noticed the script. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable aspect of the creature and you get a first example of how not to scare.
