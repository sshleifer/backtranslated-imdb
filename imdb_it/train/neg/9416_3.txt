Steve McQueen certainly has many loyal fans out there. Certainly he was a charismatic character, one of the most charismatic that the big screen has ever known. But even McQueen can't save this turkey from a movie, shot with what looks like a camera in the real places of St. Louis. <br /> <br /> McQueen is a new child without a criminal record brought into the planning of a bank robbery by one of the other gangs. There is more than a broad indication that there is a gay relationship between young Steve and David Clarke. He doesn't like the other members of the robbery at all, mainly because of his lack of a criminal record. Steve also has a girlfriend in Molly McCarthy and suspects something in particular, especially when he starts dancing with Crahan Denton and James Dukas, as well as Clarke, all rather rough characters. This would certainly have aroused my suspicions. <br /> <br /> The St. Louis Bank Great Robbery had two directors Charles Guggenheim and John Stix. Guggenheim filmed mostly documentaries and Stix didn't do much. One of those two jokers decided that Steve's performance was best performed by making a bad imitation of Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> This movie could be Steve McQueen's worst ever film. I'm willing to bet that Dick Powell and Four Star Productions had already signed him for Wanted Dead or Alive because I can't believe they would if they saw this. <br /> <br /> Or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked, except for the dressing for this turkey.
