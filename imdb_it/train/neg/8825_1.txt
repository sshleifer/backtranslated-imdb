The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love the ugly horror movies of country vacations, but that didn't qualify. In reality it is just a bad attempt to show a character slowly slipping into madness, which, again, is not a bad plot, but here it is hurt. There are some scenes (like the ending) that are not meant to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There have been a couple of times that I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never meets what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you're looking for a Christmas slasher movie, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
