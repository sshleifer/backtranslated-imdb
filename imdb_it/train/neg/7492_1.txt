Apparently most viewers know nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole of central and eastern Europe, as well as the era of Hitler and Stalin. Nuremberg (and many forgotten tests throughout Europe) was a vendetta and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why weren't Americans, British, French or Soviets accused after the Second World War? Were there no American war crimes, English crimes, etc.? There was no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans also had war crimes, but in Nuremberg justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (It was also a book title in America, 1941.) <br /> <br /> This film is a horrible and ignoble American brainwashing tool, full of errors, lies, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly ... Why wasn't the Nuremberg trial enough? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hatred and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. And there are no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would become envious ...
