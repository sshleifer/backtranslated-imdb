I couldn't believe how awful this movie was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but I thought "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching." I'm correct. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> I realize that there are not many great roles for women of a certain age, but the script of this has been so inept, clich√© and disconcerting that I am surprised that it has ever entered the development or that Mrs Keaton thought she could get a silk purse from this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of credibility and was incredibly unlikely. Acting seemed like an exercise in a BEGINNING class - I watched in horror almost all of this by asking myself "What were they thinking?" Very, very sad that it came to this. Do not waste time.
