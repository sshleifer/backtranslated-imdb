Ugh! Another one of those DVDs "deceived by the cover". I was expecting some kind of action at least with bears, cats and the like on the cover. I got nothing! Bad movie! <br /> <br /> I forced myself to look at it all the way thinking that in the end SOMETHING would have happened ... with no luck. <br /> <br /> Now the reason I gave this to 2 is because of the scenario; otherwise it was sucked. <br /> <br /> The boy was terrible, he talked to himself (although I suppose they couldn't just shoot a movie with stupid music and without dialogue), making his lame karate positions on a tree stump, threatening a raccoon , munching worms and (what an idiot) kicking a porcupine. And he wouldn't even pull out those pins so easily ... they stick like fishing hooks. At least he fought the bear (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What did the flashback story do? He made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival film, not a drama about a child suffering from divorce. <br /> <br /> What else can I say? Well, maybe they should have let the bear eat the baby or something. At least it would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People, don't waste your time with this.
