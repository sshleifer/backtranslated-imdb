This film had so much potential: a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of these elements was wasted. The story did not go anywhere, the characters were nothing short of empty and the result was a waste of a very boring, useless film. I hated it. Judging by the other votes, I'm here in the minority and I have to be a kind of monster. However, I thought this movie was terrible. I had high hopes, but I was very disappointed. A particular disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A sort of very arrogant "fixer" makes a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington has played the same character he always plays: pleasant but nothing new.
