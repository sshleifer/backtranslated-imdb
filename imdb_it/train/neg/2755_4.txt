This is the most painful collection of clich√©s, put together on a straight line, without a recognizable plot or a decent way of acting that I have seen for a long time. Canibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Reign of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, was a real war on the observer's intelligence. Was this movie good? It was not a movie at all! <br /> <br /> Although it is not so low as to be really fun and reach cult status like a comedy, the film offers some laughter. The trick is to put the copied scenes in the context of their original films. Gandalf can be fun to speak Korean, the basilisk looks hilarious when compared to a kitten and the evil minion can provide a lot of fun alternating back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever its name. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: any pleasure derived from this film completely depends on the state of intoxication and imagination of the spectators, not the director / writer. Shame, Shim!
