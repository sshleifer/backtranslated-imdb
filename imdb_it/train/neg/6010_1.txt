This film is perhaps one of the most boring films of 2000 I've seen! Especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear. Even aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness. History itself has problems: the UN could never take power over the world, since only the United States would not allow it, but nations like China, Russia, Japan, etc. They wouldn't even do it. This could also play against someone trying to conquer the world like Nicolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond movies, only those have more action! Of course the film is made for Christians and only for Christians and they could enjoy it. Since I cannot consider myself a Christian, I find the whole idea ridiculous. Moreover this prophecy seems to be, if believed true, dangerously close to other prophecies for cults for the end of the world. Why fear such a possibility when we can make life as good as possible here on Earth without it
