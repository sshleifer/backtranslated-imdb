Phantom of the Mall is a film that best fits the "easily forgotten" category. It is a rather disgusting variant of the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Phantom of the Opera. It's not a bad idea for himself, but the plot and production of this film are weak to bring a decent tribute to that story. On the positive side, Gaston Leroux has yet to turn in his grave. It could be much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks and too many boring sequences to make it memorable. Moreover, the writers wanted to give too much draft to the history of the necessary. And even if there is a lot of mystery in building Eric's character ... the basic plot is ordinary and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** This is a young couple who is brutally ripped off because the boy is killed in a fire. That fire was brought to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home to make room for a huge shopping center to be built. The boy survived the fire and hid in the mall to take revenge. Meanwhile he protects his girlfriend who now works in the mall and tries to forget his loss. **** END SPOILER *** This rather simple - but rather effective - plot is thickened by many useless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should be just a horror movie, try desperately to be a smart thriller ... and it's not what the fans are looking for. There are some innovative killings but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to watch a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least some humor !! All this production - including the cast - behaves too seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... Like for example, he has as protagonist Ken Foree !! Die-hard horror fans will surely recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It's like the milestone of horror that has yet to find an equal. Although his role in this film is limited and even completely useless ... it was nice to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she is a good actress and an elegant woman. Even Pauly Shore is in this, but I can't stand it ... so my opinion of him might be a little partial. And finally, a little praise for the lead actress named Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl and has a little talent ... too bad she never made it to the top. In fact, this film is his biggest success and says enough about his career ...
