I can't even believe this show lasted until it worked. I guess it's all part of America's dying man. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went with its original title - "Seinfeld". What bothers me most about this show, apart from the obvious, the basic sense of "humor", and general malice, is the pretentious way in which the episodes are titled. Really great shows are still fun after many, repeated visions, like "the one where Rob is accidentally hypnotized", in the "Dick Van Dyke Show", or "the one in which Lucy and Ethel work in the sugar factory". In other words, it is an honor bestowed on the big programs by the spectators. That the writers and producers of "Friends" would have had the all-powerful hubris to actually name the episodes themselves, in such a way, before anyone even has the chance to see it a second time, speaks not only of mediocrity and lack of original Thought by said writers, but also of the foolish minds of their viewers. <br /> <br /> Read the comments of some of these people and you can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of feeling of greeting card. The true meaning of friendship? Do I want to be a friend? Do I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people should work in coffee shops and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live for $ 4000 / month. apartments? Come back down to earth. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of this. That New York does not exist for anyone who does less than a serious six-figure income. But, good luck with all this, anyway. Now, shut up and pass the Soma.
