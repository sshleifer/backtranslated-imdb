Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this film was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen him since I was in seventh year in a Presbyterian school, so I'm not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me ... and most of my friends. It served its purpose, at least until we were old enough and experienced enough to analyze and create our opinions. I was particularly terrified of what newly converted converts had to endure when they did not receive the mark of the beast. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, so I won't mention the details of the scenes, but I can still imagine it in my mind ... and it's been 19 years.
