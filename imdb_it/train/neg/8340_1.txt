One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I got so bored that I turned it off halfway to see the news. When I turned it back on, I fell asleep. The film begins with a dream, continues with a dream and ends with a dream. Then there are other dreams in between. Come on, what should I worry about this? A film must have a reason to be interesting. The moment you heard that the film was just a dream is when a sensitive spectator turns off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling you their dreams and what it means to them? This is absolutely !!! <br /> <br /> Absolutely horrible.
