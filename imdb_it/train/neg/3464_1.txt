It seems that many of the people who reviewed this film only looked at it first because it was shot near where they live. How is that for an encouragement round? If this film was shot near where I lived, I wouldn't talk about it in my review. It's horrible! Several reviews state that this film is a cheeky or ironic horror film, it is neither one nor the other. It is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy in that it is not only a bad attempt at a horror film, but also a comedy. I laughed, as incredibly ugly as the film was. <br /> <br /> This film has 2 positive things, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately it would have been more interesting to watch an hour and a half of the mask and a weapon laying on a table, then looking at this junk. Even the social commentary behind the film is ridiculous, youthful and stupid. Don't worry about this movie, you've already lost time reading this review, don't waste any more on this movie. Arrggghhh! It is exasperating that even films like this are made. I expected the whole cast to be credited to a crew of Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, doesn't want to be credited with a film because it's so ugly. <br /> <br /> There is nothing redeeming in this film, I spent $ 1.19 for the rental and I feel I was robbed. To avoid. 1 in 10
