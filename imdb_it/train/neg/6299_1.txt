This inept adaptation of one of Martin Amis's weakest novels fails to even compare to other druggy works such as Requiem For A Dream or any other Irvine Walsh written as he struggles to decide if it is a cartoon slap or a hyper-realistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> Interested, directed by William Marsh in overcrowded colors, a group of abandoned public school converges in a villa awaiting the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of drug dealing. And this is all. Except for the ridiculous sub-plot plot that will soon become the absurdity of the main plot of an extremist cult group that expresses itself with the violent killings of the world's elite figures, be it political or spoiled. Inside the first roller you know exactly where it is going. <br /> <br /> What does a talented actor like Paul Bettany do in this boring badly written boredom? Done before his rise to fame and Jennifer Connelly, you can be sure that if he had been offered this junk he would have immediately changed agents! To avoid.
