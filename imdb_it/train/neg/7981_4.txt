The Rookie suffers so much. There are random music songs interspersed with the film, the long meaningless script and the bastard farce to make Jerry Lewis blush. Noonan and Leavitt don't know when to stop. It takes a whole hour before the story finally arrives at the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. Then the boys start playing with the Japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. It's a shame that the funniest parts of the movie are when Noonan and Leavitt play the stupid, stereotypical Japanese boys. But it gets quite tiring after switching between two sets of characters. So it ends abruptly. Even a naked Julie Newmar in a towel can't save this. <br /> <br /> There is really a little charm in the film and it lasts more than half an hour. The story continues to follow, trying to create fun and failing situations. Follow Martin and Lewis. At least Deano had charm and Jerry had that animated face.
