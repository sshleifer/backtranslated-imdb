Bela Lugosi is a wicked botanist who sends brides to poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in her fake ambulance / hearse and takes it home for her nano assistant to extract gland juices to keep Bela's wife eternally young. Some second-rate actors playing detective try to solve the terrible, terrible mystery. Bela Lugosi sums it up well, but you can say that he needed money. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely horrible, and most of the actors would have been better to stick to waiting tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell everyone what happens and they tend to laugh a lot and ask to see the movie. I got the DVD in a discount 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a fairly accurate assessment, anyone who pays more for it would be crazy.
