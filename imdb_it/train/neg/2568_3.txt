Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most strangely talented actors there was. But his choice of films, for example, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He didn't seem to realize how to use his talents. It would have been better to work with other Kubricks from the world of cinema than the people he did. Of his later films, only "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" struck me of those I've seen. <br /> <br /> Having said that, the Boultings and Sellers have made some films before this doesn't seem so bad - I have yet to see "Carlton Browne" and "Skies above!" - At least in the sense of using sellers to a certain extent. But "There's a Girl in My Soup" is really a poor movie and a terrible choice for Sellers in terms of character. In his films from 1955 to 1964, one can usually expect at least one very inventive touch and always an enigmatic condemnation in his roles. Here, you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic role. They are almost the sellers who play a Niven cad without joviality. Certainly not convincing, try as it could, or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to the masters of softness like Cary Grant and concentrate on those intriguing dramatic and comedic roles he was famous for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers don't actually create any genuine chemistry; this is not a brilliant and simple love story, like that of William Powell and Myrna Loy. It sounds very artificial, to the end - I know it's part of the Danvers character who is a female prosecutor herald, but in reality it doesn't change convincingly. Even the sellers have a very fascinating way of "enchanting" ... this character really has no depth and does not actually gain the sympathy or interest of the viewer. Sellers go through the motions in a way that would not be possible to think of when they remember the magnificence of his iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". <br /> <br /> There is really nothing to say about the plot, the direction or the characters, frankly they leave little or no impression. This is truly one of the most anemic, complacent, misguided and slightly boring movies I've ever seen. A nullity of a "vehicle" for the undisputed talents of the Sellers. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: - * 1/2 / *****
