The case is the best part of the film, but by itself it is not worth the purchase price. I was expecting a movie "Based on the true story" only to find a hodge-podge shot of home videos of poorly-bound clips linked to pathetic action scenes and unrelated slaughter scenes. The video scenes presented numerous rewinding situations that were probably used to extend the length of the function rather than the effects. I started this review before it was even in the middle of the movie and I waited for it to finish, in case it had a better ending, but since it got worse. If you could mark it at a lower value, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistake and save your money and your time with this.
