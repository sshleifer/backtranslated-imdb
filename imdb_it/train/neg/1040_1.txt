I can't believe this movie managed to get such a high score of 6! It's barely watchable and incredibly boring, certainly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long, long time. <br /> <br /> In a budgetless way, it reminded me of Star Wars Episodes I and II for the pure impression that you are looking at a total creative disaster. <br /> <br /> This film should be avoided at all costs. It is one of those "festival films" that only pseudo-intellectuals like because they are so badly made that people think they do it "differently", so good. <br /> <br /> Bad movie making is not "different" ", it's just bad film making.
