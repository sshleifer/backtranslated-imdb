This is a poor movie of any level. The plot of Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing of a certain charm (Woody Allen mixed his own culture with that of the classic English murder and explored what can be done with it). <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, has none of this. It is poorly written, the two protagonists are hopelessly in wood and the story itself has no interest. The kind that spoof requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and ligatures (why are the tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?). <br /> <br /> The delicious and witty versions of Allen's various Hollywood genres (the curse of the jade scorpion / purple rose of Cairo, etc.) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea. Unfortunately his inspiration abandoned him this time.
