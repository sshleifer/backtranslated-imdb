Beginning with the beautiful: several times Swayze talks with Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. This is a great advantage, since normally the movie audience in the US and the UK thinks that all the people on this planet speak English (in case you are one of them: no they don't). <br /> <br /> But acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in the Netherlands (it makes toes curled and not in a positive sense). I like Swayze but this is horrible. The jaw muscles work overtime and he is wrinkling the whole movie - someone must have said he looks sick. No Patrick: it seems silly and makes up for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her collaborators. His acting is relaxed that this film could have been set in the present day. And it is not. Your dress was a clue, Alison. <br /> <br /> The best acting came from the people of the African continent and I liked Sided Onyulo like Umbopa better. Clear, warm and with character, his performance is a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> General: it's mwah-fun on a rainy day. Pity. It could have been better Lay off the director
