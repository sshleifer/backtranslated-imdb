Some journalists and their military escort try to tell the truth about a zombie epidemic, despite the "government that controls the media". The features of the film do not include that George Romero's zombie movies worked only because he subtly maintained his politics against most of his films ("Land of the Dead" resistette). This satire is as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more appropriate for this scenario. What is subversive or subtle in seeing a military boy masturbate to death and destruction? Something different about the various spots that are inter-cut with the film? No. Furthermore, the acting is uniformly horrible, the characters completely unlikely and the plot senseless. Add all this and you have the worst, the most incompetent zombie movie ever since "C.H.U.D. 2" raised its horrible head. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
