I just finished watching this DVD at home. We love westerns, so my husband rented it. He started apologizing to me halfway. The saddles, the costumes, the accents: everything was off. The part that drove me crazy is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow while he was taking the soul of the fat boy. His only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows to the left". We looked at it all the way and, like someone else said ... too many bad things to identify one reason why it sucked. I mean, the fact that the boy managed to snatch the evil stone from the collector the same month and day it was found, what's the point? And why was there a courtyard where everyone died on April 25, but were the people whose souls had been taken by the collector still around? If you want a movie to be fun after a few beers, this could be your movie. However, if you want a real western, you would hate this movie.
