What a party of the Russians <br /> <br /> Of all the fragments of nostalgia that Hollywood has decided to redo and update, this is by far one of the most useless. This was a totally useless show in the first place, and we REALLY don't need a "modern" update. <br /> <br /> No matter the bigotry and sexism inherent in the system from the beginning, so much progress has been made, socially, since the show ran the whole point of the show (if ever had had one) was lost. <br /> <br /> Also, what's the point of having a character named Boss Hogg if he's NOT overweight?
