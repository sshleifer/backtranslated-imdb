This apocalyptic zombie movie tries to be vicious and shocking; but FEEDING THE MASSES comes off like some zombies with stiff legs chasing the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus virus is thrown into crisis by the government that manipulates newspapers and televisions. A couple of brave but stupid souls of Channel 5 TV News feel that the public is given a false hope and no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An enthusiastic journalist (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina), with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen), risk their lives and limbs to present a "live" broadcast to show fate at hand . Do yourself a favor and don't look. This is obviously a very low budget and comes up against the feeling of a bad school game. Acting is atrocious and meat-hungry zombies are almost comical. Also appear: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. BODY FEED should be starved to death.
