From the capitol nepotism of the world comes another junk movie in a fantasy shell. "CQ" tells a lame and disjointed mess of a story that is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures, a child and a straight man Davies who was running trying to make a stupid science fiction movie. I can't think of any of the reasons why someone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt to make a movie. (D)
