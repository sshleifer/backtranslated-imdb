Bad plot, bad dialogue, bad acting, direction idiot, the annoying soundtrack of the groove porn that flowed continuously over the overwhelmed script, and a lousy copy of the VHS cannot be redeemed by consuming liquor. Trust me, because I blocked this turkey until the end. He was so pathetically ill everywhere that I had to understand that it was a parody of Springtime for fourth-speed Hitler. <br /> <br /> The girl who played Janis Joplin was the only weak spark of interest, and it was only because she could sing better than the original. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something similar but a thousand times better, then look at Beyond The Valley of The Dolls.
