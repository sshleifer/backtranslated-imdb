For those of us who lived through those weeks of filming in the city and around the valley - let's not forget the boring days of road closures and "film making". As a reminder to those living here - the locals include Boulder Creek, Bonny Doon, Davenport, Big Basin. etc. The bank was the BC fire station; hunting scenes included Moon Drive from Hwy 236, Empire Grade Rd and Hwy 1. <br /> <br /> Production: Jeffrey Jones was the most accessible, Matt Broderick was above all of us - even then. As for the film, a script joke is also a bigger laugh about acting and plot, but who cares about this level. A beautiful time capsule for those who love our coast and the landscape of the valley. <br /> <br /> Additional notes; Joe's Bar (Jed's Tavern in the film), the original name of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba parking lot was the town square, the shots from the back yard were off Grove Street in Boulder Creek; turn off the thinking hood and see some actors in their early days.
