This was a really bland movie. The exhibits are third-rate, and the dialogue is so pungent that it sometimes seems to have just rolled and died. The reason I rented this was simple: find a movie with the script. I needed visual help for my presentation, so I realized why not use a clip? The boy was wrong. After searching for my local video store, I came across this, where it was suspiciously titled "Starstruck". I thought, "What the hey", and I decided to try it. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There was perhaps a scene I could use, and in the meantime I was practically falling asleep because of the pure banality of the film. So ..... I got it and got Ed Wood. There is a movie that I can use as an example. Then again, anything would be presentable compared to the drivel which is "Starfucker".
