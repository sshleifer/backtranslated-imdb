Who wrote this? A guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first script I've ever worked on. Someone should have told him that you should write a dialogue that sounds like something someone might say. <br /> <br /> And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My die fell away from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a taxi in New York, and it will look real, and you won't have to pretend with a blue screen for no reason. He could also let him know that he should have stayed away from Jessica Simpson, but I hope he learned that lesson now. <br /> <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... of course cannot act. To hell, it makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, yet she's the star of this movie. Oh wait, it was produced by his father. Ok, that's why he got the part. This is really the only reason I can think of. <br /> <br /> So should I be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would do it if they saw it like me. I mean, you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... it's not just ugly, it's the exact opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as that movie is good. It is the Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes and couldn't go on. No doubt I would have left the theater first. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw him for the theater actually stayed to watch the whole thing. The film starts ridiculously bad, and then gets to the point of being so bad as to become a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first act ends, you realize that it will only be worse, and that's when you either have to leave or kill yourself. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used instead of waterboarding in Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer water boarding.
