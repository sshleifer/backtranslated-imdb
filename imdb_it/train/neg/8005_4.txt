Gwoemul (The Host) - Due to pollution in the Han river a mutated beast goes on a rampage. The youngest member of the Park family is kidnapped by the beast and it is up to the rest of his family to find her, before she becomes the beast's last meal. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love monster movies: mutated bears, large alligators, packs of Komodo dragons, everything. The characteristics of the creatures are my favorite genre of horror movies. So, I really wanted to like The Host, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> There were three main problems: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen with a quick look at his IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> <br /> Too many damn genres. He took himself too seriously to be a comedy, yet he was too light to have a real message (although he seems to be trying to make some sort of declaration: anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The play was misplaced and mixed in a mixture of mixture with all the other styles. <br /> <br /> Secondly, after the initial monstrous attack nothing happens for almost the whole movie. The central family wanders to look for one of them while the governments of Korea and America, apparently, do nothing. And that's all, they just wander around, sometimes beating each other, presumably for some relief from the comedy. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently did the same for the director, since an entire plot was not resolved (a mysterious plague invented by the American villains is completely forgotten, and was never solved). <br /> <br /> And finally, the film is awkwardly political. He depicts Americans as stupid and evil, but he doesn't give us American characters with a depth greater than a villain's villain. The opening scene has the stupid Korean American moment vs the most obvious essay. With a Korean morgue assistant asking his chief medical examiner not to spill chemicals into the Han river. The American coroner almost cackles maniacally as he orders the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, it's a lazy movie and there's no excuse for that. <br /> <br /> The positive side is that the monster is good, a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are quite interesting and the first monster chase through the park is a lot of fun. There are also some nice shots in the film. Some of which remind me, strangely, of the way in which Firefly was shot (trembling cameras, out of focus, etc.). There is also a beautiful scene at the end, where the hero and a boy he saved are sitting in the family mobile food stall. It's night and the snow is falling, the streetlight gives out a cold light, but the food stall has a warm light coming from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I couldn't wait to make a film of decent creatures, and instead I have a pseudo-political and horror-comic quarrel. Looking at the comments on IMDb I can't help but think that if this had been an American production it would have been planned. Just because it's a foreign film doesn't mean it's good. In recent years there have been some great films outside Korea (The trilogy of revenge and Brotherhood, for example), but this certainly is not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once I'm in favor of a remake. Directing, improving the script and this could have been a good film. As it is, it is not worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.
