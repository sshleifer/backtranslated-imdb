Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (like Carl Kolchak) is back; this time, he's looking for "The Night Strangler". Once again, police officers and other journalists do not believe or want to cover the supernatural corner. Director and producer Dan Curtis presents the same basic story of his previous "Night", with understandably less success. <br /> <br /> Curtis assembles a fun supporting cast, including former Dark Shadows students George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) directs a sexy collection of belly dancers. And, even though I've never seen him mentioned anywhere, that must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's roommate in one of the first scenes, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** The Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
