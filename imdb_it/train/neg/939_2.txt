I loved the Batman TV series and couldn't wait to do it. But they tried to do too much. <br /> <br /> Because they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I don't want to beat Burt or Adam for their appearance now ... It's been 35 years since they appeared in Batman and Robin, but seeing them dressed in elegant clothes and fighting the "bad guys" was pretty sad. I'd rather just see the ex-stars make comments. The side story of the batmobile was stupid. <br /> <br /> As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and missed too much. It was just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same things I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated and was a former smoker. It was about those 2. <br /> <br /> I'd like to read the book. I'm sure he has more in it than this has shown. Like because there were 2 Riddlers or because 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freeze. Where were Commander Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. As I said, even those who were in this were barely inside. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really trivial.
