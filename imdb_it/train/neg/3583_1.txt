If there were a scale below 1, he would get a -10, following in the footsteps of Godspell. The acting (if there was such a thing) was atrocious, the plot in chaos. And Rene Russo was disgustingly sweet in his role, enough to make a person vomit. Ten inches down for a stupid movie. Save grace: congratulations for the costumes of the time.
