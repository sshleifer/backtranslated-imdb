It's a really rough parody of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones, the humor of cheese, as well as acting. But after all it's a soft core movie, which is expected and it doesn't matter because what you really want is sex. Which brings me to the biggest problem of all, there's barely one. Which makes you feel like you're watching TV at 3am and independent movies are playing and what's there is being done by a college guy who's not going anywhere in that industry. You have plenty of time waiting for a real sex scene, many times you think something will happen, so you will simply leave it suspended. The one (maybe two, or one with two parts) that actually goes somewhere is very pleasant though. Personally I can't recommend it unless you've found it in a transparent bin for a dollar or two. If you're looking for a good movie with a plot and good acting, you don't want it. If you're looking for a good lesbian soft core movie, you don't want that either.
