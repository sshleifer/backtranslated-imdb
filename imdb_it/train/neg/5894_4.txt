How many centuries will pass until Japanese / Asian horror films leave the ghost-shtick with long hair? Of course, they have managed to snatch "Ringu" a million times, and it has often worked well - which shows that originality is not so much a requirement in the horror genre (or are they very uncritical and easy to please?). However, this time I found myself a little restless, a little bored. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd length of 110 minutes. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Furthermore, the ending is confusing: it makes no sense. As for the ringtone: Miike could have found a more effective melody than that little forgettable thing. Although it has been played a dozen times, I can't even remember it: it's so scary. Speaking of Miike, this is a business for him, so if anyone thinks they are perverting the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" type, they are wasting time.
