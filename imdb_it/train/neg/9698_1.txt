Today in Germany there are many talented directors / actors. None of them is associated with this "film". <br /> <br /> Why do manufacturers in the world really invest money in something like this? You could have made 10 good movies with the budget of this junk! It's not fun to have seven men around like dwarves, pretending to be funny. What's funny is that the producer of the film (which seems to be the oldest of the group) plays the YOUNGEST nano. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments that scream in captions saying "You should laugh now!" It's hard to believe that this shit is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Many people actually got up and left the cinema for 30 minutes in the movie. I should have done the same instead of wasting time ... <br /> <br /> Pain!
