Yes, I know I am one of the few people who want to trample this film into the dust of oblivion. So let me tell you why I feel this way. Actually, if it was advertised as a Zombie movie or something, I could have enjoyed it. But now, I'm totally speechless. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ... Even if I'm not sure what to ruin * Let's start with the first HUGE flaw. If I didn't know that the film is called "Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version" and I didn't see any sequences in which some individuals seem to suck blood, I wouldn't have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS ???? Give me a break !!! <br /> <br /> Second negative point: what is the Metal? It seems that all young people, but above all the so-called "vampires", are in various types of metal, judging mainly by their shirts! Don't get me wrong, I've been in the most extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody will scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all bands !!!) T-shirts that ran, pretending to be Vampires! "Pathetic" is the only word I could use here. <br /> <br /> Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT actors? You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here. <br /> <br /> Yes, okay, the film is very gory, but what difference does it make? It would have been a strength and something to be enjoyed if the "brilliant" director had not chosen to create a theme on ARTIFICIAL vampires in this film. I wanted to see vampires, but I was treated to stupid kids that I'd like to use my baseball bat. Filmmakers should simply advertise the film by saying "cheap class B horror with no plot but a lot of blood" !!! <br /> <br /> This film is a blasphemy against the whole concept of vampirism. And it makes me sick.
