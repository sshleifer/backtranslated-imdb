REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the wonderful reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a great pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would have laughed out loud, and a lot, but I had an appointment with a former soldier. I couldn't hide my other answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think that my appointment, a "good old boy", was liked. This is not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work .... It's okay for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful joke on Ralph's part. I will vote a 2 just because Ralph seemed SO WELL. But I have to protest, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to watch The End of the Affair to recover and recover now .... C1
