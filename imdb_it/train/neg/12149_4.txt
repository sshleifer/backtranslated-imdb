Set in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses seeks to be a satirical look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be applied to how the United States tries to control the media during the war in Iraq, but ends up feeling empty. There is never any tension in history and acting has never been very good. Worse, the film's direction is atrocious, it focuses more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond "It's not a strange way to hold the camera". The special effects are pretty ugly ... at one point the video of an explosion is green projected on the city, and it's ridiculous at most. <br /> <br /> The film has a couple of bright spots ... that is, advertisements for post-zombie services (including a remediation service and a bus party). But it is too little to make the film worthy of note. <br /> <br /> For a better zombie movie, try Hide and Creep. It has the same weak production value, but there is much more spirit, humor and talent behind it.
