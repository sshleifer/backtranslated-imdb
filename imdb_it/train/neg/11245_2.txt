I joined the theater on Sky Captain in 2004, expecting a good movie. Almost every review of this film had been positive, the effects were attractive, the previews convincing. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the disappointment does not actually describe the feeling I received from this film. It was a rage. <br /> <br /> Besides being boring and poorly written, the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and a theft: this was stealing. More importantly, it appears that the filmmakers have not stolen to advance a point or move the plot. They only stole to prove they could. There is literally no point in showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the film other than setting up another scene (which I won't go into) stealing from the same movie. Needless to say, every concept in the film was neither original nor even the spin of an old concept: it was literally just a remake of something I had already seen, from the pulp-era robots that resembled the old Superman Cartoons and the recent film " Iron Giant ", for the silent follower of the martial artist who has been used in countless films, the most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in" Star Wars: The Phantom Menace ". <br /> <br /> subject of the film itself, most of the performances were completely in wood. Perhaps because the entire film was shot on a blue screen, with computer images filling everything except the actors. Frankly, this is not an excuse to play badly. If a person has ever been a child, he understands that the lack of visual references is not an excuse for not trying. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is no humanity in this film. The protagonists are the only real human beings here. Almost all the antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one side. If robots are attacking the entire planet, shouldn't we expect to see masses of humanity escaping from them? The comparable performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to, really, anything here. <br /> <br /> The film was not the worst film out there, and that's why I didn't give it a 1 Rather, the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action movies: the directors have tried to justify the film with special effects, but without an artistic vision or originality of any kind, it collapses.
