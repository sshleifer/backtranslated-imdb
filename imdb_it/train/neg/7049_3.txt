The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a film about surfers without waves. For spectators who love surfing this film will be a huge disappointment as the total number of minutes of surf footage struggles to reach three. <br /> <br /> The plot is a cross section of surfers who do not wait for a perfect wave, but for any wave. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is a super old surfer who is flirting with a commitment to his girlfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is about to find the happiness that he has grown up with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends show up and convince him to reach the beach in search of monstrous waves at Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves until the end of the film, so most of the story dissolves into a meandering succession of disconnected events on the beach. <br /> <br /> Acting is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has some comic moments, but above all his acting has been trivial. Ewan McGregor was decent as the drug dealer, by far the most interesting and peculiar character in the group. Probably the funniest performance was shot by Peter Gunn as Terry who turned his burly body into a continuous gag. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough flesh for her to show many acting skills. <br /> <br /> There isn't really much here to comment on. I rated it 3/10. It's a real pity for the beach.
