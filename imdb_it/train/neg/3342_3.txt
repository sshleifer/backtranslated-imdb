I didn't expect much from a film directed by Sidney J. Furie and starring Dolph Lundgren, but I certainly expected more than a success. A comment on just one user - the second low-priced action film - didn't seem too deplorative for a Lundgren film. On the other hand, I wouldn't have bothered to watch this movie if its rating was less than 5.0 but, hey, the film had a score of 5.9 out of 10, which seemed quite acceptable for this type of production. <br /> <br /> Now I understand that 37.5% of the people who voted for this movie at 10 (excellent) was clearly a publicity stunt because DETENTION is the normal Nu Image trash you've seen before, over and over times. <br /> <br /> Lundgren is not convinced as an ex-military man who has become a history teacher assigned to a primary school. His acting is simply terrible, emotionless and artificial. Lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with young juvenile delinquents. Either they are great actors or, compared to Lundgren, they look like great actors - just because they seem natural and credible. <br /> <br /> DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low-budget film - a closed-weekend high-security high-school movie, four teenagers in detention with a veteran war teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to enter - but the story (something like THE CLUB CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) is full of incredible situations, many cliches and stereotyped characters. And let's not forget that Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dob√≥ play a pair of lovers Bonnie and Clyde and offer the most acceptable performances of the film, even if it seems a low The economic version of Sam Rockwell and her, a Milla Jovovich, want to be . In a movie where everything fails, their madness and their style have provided enough fresh air to prevent my interest from being reduced to zero.
