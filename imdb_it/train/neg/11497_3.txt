This warning against anti-Semitism is well-intentioned and may have had its purpose at that time, but it is done without the slightest idea of ​​how to make a film. The director has no idea of ​​the staging; the cast varies from bad to worse. <br /> <br /> The great Austrian cartoonist Hans Moser is wasted. In its part it ends up in a madhouse for the mad, which is designed as a set of Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; one wonders if the producers had all their mental abilities. <br /> <br /> The restored copy I saw (Dutch Filmmuseum) gives the impression that some scenes have not been placed in the right place, but the original editing might be wrong too.
