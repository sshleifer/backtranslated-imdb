What a joke. I look at it on Channel 1 and I think watching dry paint is a lot more fun. What happened to Caspar Van Dien that brought him into this nightmare. Terrible acting, very boring storyline and terrible direction. It's so terrible, it's fun. Supposed to be full of suspense, but it is more a comedy. If you want to see terrible acting, a ridiculous script and a sub-par plot, check out this movie. If I were Van Dien, I wouldn't just ask my 10% to my agent, but I'll fire the bastard in the process. What a turkey. It is not even suitable for being on MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to cure your insomnia. I especially like the part where Van Dien is thrown overboard and then gets him back in a few minutes! I can only imagine that this was written by non-union writers using the writer's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
