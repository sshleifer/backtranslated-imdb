I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35 am last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually do DirecTivo, but not last night). I woke up at 3 am (investment bank on the west coast), and I was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this "movie" is. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This is really bad. writing is boring, but the direction and editing are simply inferior to those of a freshman in a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's filmed on video. Mind you, that is shot on VIDEO, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. The skateboard video clips look more "cinematic" to them than this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the bad direction but honestly I don't remember anything. The shots and the block are stupid. yes, I chose the word "stupid". not unconventional, not bold, not bold, not boring, just stupid. I know the people reviewing this review will say "Well, give me an example." I can't. It was 3 in the morning. but believe me, I know you will look at it anyway, you will be attracted by the horrible reviews. <br /> <br />
