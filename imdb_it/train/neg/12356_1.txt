Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the film, but I resisted. I don't know what Ridley Scott meant, but I learned that women are as stupid as men in the army. They learn to spit, insult and fight in combat, and it's also a waste of time (in my opinion). And anyway, what the hell was that final scene in Libya? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
