When you look at a little man, you'll spend your free time trying to figure out his many holes in the plot. And this is not a good sign because this film should be a comedy! You should laugh about this !! But will you do it? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the little man is his concept - it's too ridiculous to accept (even as a comedy comedy), so when the noisy, tiring jokes above which they take over, they do the whole thing seems ten times more stupid than it already is. <br /> <br /> "But it's a comedy" some of you might scream. True, but it's not an excuse for such a stupid plot. I mean, let's think about it if you saw a child with A GROWN MANS FACE, aren't you the least bit suspicious? And if Calvin wanted to hide the diamond so much, why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random handbag? And how can a qualified doctor NOT recognize that calvin is an adult man? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> "It's not about the plot, but the laughter" you might scream. Well, here's the thing, there are very few laughs in the little man and this just brings out the stupid texture of the ass. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a comedy of the Wayans brothers with a conviction that suspends the plot, stick to the white chicks, because at least this one had some decent laughs. What do you ever do to avoid the little man.
