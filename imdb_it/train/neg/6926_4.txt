I got it on the DVD 10 pack CURSE OF THE DEAD. You have to love those bargain packages. Although they do not have real remastering, restoration and all that hoo-ha, and the films are generally in pan and full-format scan, there is no denying that there are always some gems included. And for "gems", I mean that there's always some nice shit to see, especially if the movies are from the 70s like The Mansion of Madness. <br /> <br /> My copy is called Mansion of Madness, but when the screenshots of the title roll it is the Torture Dungeon by Dr. Tarr by Poe. It doesn't really matter how crap sucks crap isn't it? Yup! But to say that this film is completely useless is not true at all. There are some funky elements here and there, and of course the film has a decent budget. <br /> <br /> The opening title sequence is fantastic with its colored negative flowing through a cheap television appearance. Dialogue is always fun. Towards the beginning of the film, the horse and buggy driver leaves to move a dead tree in the middle of the road. "WHAT A STRENGTH!" says our hero. It is funny, therefore, that this guy is no longer able to defeat the bizarre woodcutters when they come to make weird fun. You would completely forget that this guy was also in the movie until he recovers later towards the end. This is how these characters are memorable. <br /> <br /> The best part of Mansion of Madness, however, must be the extravagant music and the wild hunts that good guys have to endure. It's like bad cartoon music that a three-year-old could find funny. And why all the weirdo slapstick, anyway? I would say that my favorite moment was when the horse and buggy were ambushed by forest monsters when they shoot a stupid homemade ghost from a stick in the middle of the road and make the carriage stop. What the hell? Oh yes, there are a lot of tits to see even for those of you who dig these things. Boobies, bad dialogues and extravagant music. Those best sums of Mansion of Madness for me. It is worth at least a vision, and it could be much better if you had someone to drink or something. I can't say I was bored watching it, but I can't deny that it's also a barrel of poop. A bit like the Magical Mystery Tour but with a plot, but not. Hmm. <br /> <br /> And Mr. Chicken PWNZ.
