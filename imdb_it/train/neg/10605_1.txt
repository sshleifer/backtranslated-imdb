This was a terrible waste of my time. No plot Acting was far below the norm, it should be used as an example in acting classes of what NOT to do. It's just a commercial rip-off of the previous Universal Soldier, who also scrapes the bottom of the acting barrel. It is sad that VD needs to affirm its ego every few years, and even more sad that people will pay good money to sit. This kind of schlock gives Martial Arts movies a bad name. By comparison, Segall, Norris and Arnold seem almost talented. <br /> <br /> Maybe VD should take Leslie Nielson's track and send his genre. At least then we could laugh with him instead of him.
