This serial is interesting to see as an MST3K function, but for today's audience it's all. I was really surprised to see the year in which it was made in 1952. Considering that the fact alone makes this solid (humbly?) 2 in my book. Used cars don't even seem contemporary, they look like things from the 1930s. It's basically Cody (the salvation of the lonely world? Sheesh speaks of an insult to everyone else, like the military), however it's Cody in his panting suit against Graber and Daley two stupid * ss henchman who pulls guns and occasionally a ray gun rather lame in its own right, have fun. If you want to see a really good serial, see Flash Gordan, it's full of rockets that attack each other and a good evil nemesis and even good-looking women, this has none of this. And Flash was created about 15 years before this shit, so you can give it some play. Something done in 1952, this bad, deserves a 2. Nuff said. give it a 6 if you look at it like an MST3K episode, those have a little fun with it; a pinch of nipples here, a pinch there and I'm flying! And now as an added bonus, I bring you the song Commander Cody Theme as originally sung by Joel and his two character robots Tom Servo and Crow aboard the love satellite for episode eight The Enemy Planet: <br /> < br /> (Singing to the end credits); <br /> <br /> (TOM SERVO SINGING) YOUR LOOKING COMMANDER CODE ...
