first let's say, I watched this movie around midnight, and there's usually only garbage around for this hour, but this movie broke the record <br /> <br /> first of all the main character is an old man unattractive and terrifying boy, yet he manages to fuck all the girls who come across his path, such as going to a store, talking to a girl and then seeing them f * ck <br /> <br /> secondly there it's a lot of sex scenes, and in many of them there's no nudity, I wouldn't have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie said: Quickly put on your clothes so we can f * ck! <br /> <br /> thirdly this film should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family, this film shows only a soft erotic misinterpreted makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such garbage
