Where to start? special effects should be named special defects, when the director shouted "action" I imagine he also indicated the actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Perhaps he was annoyed by the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single penny from their investment and that the work would be a case study on how not to make films. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant but his family wouldn't let him. <br /> <br /> The only certain thing is that whoever uses it in the future is because he is in love with him (so his objectivity is skipped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous previous references.
