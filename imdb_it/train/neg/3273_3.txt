Is the Dukes of Hazzard a nice result? a $ 53 million movie that is worse than any episode of a 25-year low-end television show. The plot is quite useful but the unreasonable fun is rarely to be found and the casting is rather atrocious: Johnny Knoxville is more a passenger than a protagonist, M.C. The sheriff of Gainey Roscoe is a bland thug, tired of Michael Weston's Enos, an apparently ideal cast Willie Nelson seems to be waiting for a check to clear and Burt Reynolds, stuck in a purgatory where he is condemned to relive his old movies as a little player, he is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least, but he has a good time with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. Do you know that a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen appearances ?? But worse than the script or the casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: apparently born without any conception of comic time, unable to do much more than two basic strokes and seemingly unaware of how to shoot a car chase, much less the couple of decent acrobatics in the film, seems determined to sap the film from any sign of life before they materialize. There are a couple of nice post-modern moments that revolve around the Confederate flag and the stereotypical role of Daisy in each episode, but no movie that drives you crazy for the days when Hal Needham directed this kind of thing (and bad) can be a good thing.
