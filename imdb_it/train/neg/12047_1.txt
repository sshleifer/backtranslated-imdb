I had the greatest enthusiasm for the preliminary screening of this film. After all, this is one of the oldest and most complex stories known to mankind, and it was one of the first epic stories I read as a child (even before Tolkien). I must say that it was a huge disappointment. They completely transformed the plot into a joke and turned it into a long soap opera. The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were so randomly sprinkled that the audience was laughing at many times with the silly script that just paid tribute to this battle of all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles (who has a strange combination of powers almost similar to the Matrix, absolute ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem) turn to "Fabio on the beach" in the guise of Pitt (who with a good script and more effort could have turned it into a more complex and original warrior figure than Hollywood has ever produced). The actors were really decent, trying to make the most of a ridiculous script. It was actually a waste of so much talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show, and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic). Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and don't even hold a candle for them. Lots of pieces for women to watch but not enough battle scenes for a film about a long battle and a siege. I would not advise anyone to pay to see this story dragged into the dirt like one of the characters (at least they got it right).
