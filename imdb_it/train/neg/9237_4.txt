Stalker is right! The girl sees the boy, the girl wants a boyfriend, the girl devises trivial ways to keep slamming him, the girl won't leave him alone, the girl pretends to be a patient, the girl can't stop talking about him, the girl pretends to love another boy (or two), he does not pay attention to her because she is annoying, the girl STILL will not leave him alone. Right, the character of Drake could have been fascinating but is completely, totally, inexorable in the search for the character of Cary Grant, his girlfriend in combativeness is boring, and unfortunately, Drake's attempt to play "charmingly screwball" comes out as , "disquietingly demented." Grant is himself, as usual, which is fine for Cary, but he's the closest to a performance played like I've never seen him before. The direction is weak and the dialogue is simply obscure. <br /> <br /> The Screwball comedy is very difficult to do successfully and when it fails, as in this ass stuck of an attempt, it just sucks. Worse still, Drake spends the entire movie that needs a lot of Valium and a restraining order. It ruins any humor that can be found in this drier furnace of the mummy.
