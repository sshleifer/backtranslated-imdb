I saw the movie trailer several times at the theater and got excited. It looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in the 90s. It also reminded me of the Fugitive film, a cat and mouse chase between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most insipid action thriller of all time. As I see, many people say that this is like a TV movie. Not exactly. First, there are many more TV movies in this genre. Secondly, TV movies could be very funny sometimes, but this movie is the exact opposite of having fun. It is not elegant at all visually and the most important, the tone of the film is unattractive. This is not an action movie, there are two action scenes composed of a chase and a fight. Also they are not great action scenes, but the worst is that those action scenes are very insipid like the whole movie. The love story between Douglas and Bassinger was very useless. Moreover, the killer plot to the president is the most clich√© story in this genre, but they insist on this. And this is not a cat and mouse film as it should be. Although, Douglas is very old now, he still has the potential to act in an action thriller. In the film, Michael Douglas cannot be like Tommy Lee Jones, for example. Sutherland is also a bad choice, because you feel like you're looking at Jack Bauer and, somehow, his character is one of the reasons that make the film like a TV movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, obviously it's too passive or straight in this film, because she is a soap opera actress. The film was no fun even for a second, so I couldn't get over it for a while.
