My first exposure to the Templars and not a good one. I was thrilled to find this title among the Anchor Bay Video offerings, which brought us other cult classics like "Spider Baby". The print quality is excellent, but this alone cannot hide the fact that the film is deadly boring. There is an electrifying opening sequence in which the villagers demand a terrible revenge on the Templars (and set in motion everything else), but the rest of the film is slow, ponderous and ultimately unsatisfactory. Adding insult to injury: the film was nicknamed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.
