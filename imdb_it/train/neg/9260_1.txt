The only connection this film has with horror is that it's horribly not fun. I'd rather prick a finger with a rusty nail than have to sit it again. Even for a TV movie it's flat. The cast is boring. The script is as exciting as a bowl of sand. As two directors have conspired to create such a film, it will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene that is vaguely worthy of being included in the Omen franchise, and it is filmed in silence and interrupted at the early pay-off. If you are tempted to see it, enter it, set the alarm for 90 minutes and make yourself comfortable. With a little luck you will fall asleep quickly and the alarm will wake you up once the worst is over. That is to say, this film.
