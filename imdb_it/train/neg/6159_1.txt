Why do all those who have seen this film feel that it is their responsibility to tell us if they are fencers or not? This point is completely irrelevant to any topic to do against this total dog of a film. I think sports movies fall into two categories; well-made films on the human spirit and competitions, and `By the Sword '. <br /> <br /> Honestly this film has never been able to decide what it wanted to be, a moving drama to try to be the best in life, an accusation of competitive motivation or a martial arts movie. In the end it didn't do any of those convincingly or enough to get me an ounce of care for any of them. <br /> <br /> For the record, I'm also a fencing instructor (and now I'm officially ugly like the rest). But putting a bad fencing in a movie doesn't hurt automatically. I mean watching Star Wars (Episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fencing). I liked those movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason, people think that it is only the purists who consider it an unbearable effort. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by any comment on the smallest fencing problem. This is just a bad movie. In the end, this film has nothing for the fencing enthusiast or the cinephile or simply for anyone with a pulse and three brain cells. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie and I have to think, "Man, I wish I was watching the Mighty Ducks." I know it's time to get around the subject with the theater manager to get my money back and see if there is someone in the lobby who will give me back somehow two hours of my life.
