This film should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What a shame of the budget. <br /> <br /> Please hire convincing actors and make a suitable film. Very thin texture and unconvincing lines. Almost hilarious, and this is a shame for an action movie .... <br /> <br /> Definitely not worth watching. <br /> <br /> They continue to review the same "strokes" of a flying stealth aircraft far away. You've seen one, and it's not worth repeating 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> It's time for Steven Seagal to withdraw from the creation of a movie. <br /> <br /> His films are getting worse every time. <br /> <br /> Black Dawn and Submerged were bad, but this movie is even worse.
