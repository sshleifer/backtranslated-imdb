"Gone with the Wind" is one of the most overrated films in history. It is a film loved by mothers, grandmothers and people who enter the cinema every five years. Like a zombie movie, it blows. There is no trembling corpse in sight, and it is terribly light in the blood department. "Zombie 3", on the other hand, is big on falling corpses and rather generous with its blood spill - so, it's better than "Gone with the Wind". It is also not overrated. Most reviewers leave no illusions that it is rubbish. It is not, however, boring junk. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being chased by a helicopter and the chemicals penetrate the ground. The terrorist, who was exposed to the bad concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly turns into a carnivorous zombie. One of his first victims is a cleaning lady. Once bitten, the mark of Lucio Fulci's hell is unleashed. As usual for a Fulci film, the acting is atrocious, the plot is full of holes in the plot and the blood is abundant. The film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, which explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is also badly shot, badly modified and the sound design is flat. However, he is saved by his cheerful adherence to the most glorious of murders and his impatient rhythm. Surely it is worth collecting it if you are a complete dead undead. Or don't like "Gone With The Wind", without doubt the worst zombie movie of all time.
