So, what's the big hype of doing an INDIANA JONES aspirant when you have an actor who was chosen as an imaginary guy from adventure books who don't want to go out on an adventure ??? Anyone who wrote the screenplay for JAKE SPEED was probably fired, but for whatever reason this movie is definitely lacking in enthusiasm! This does not mean that it has no action, but looks at the dark side of the image. This has nothing to do with INDIANA JONES or other chills of action and adventure that contain cliffhangers and narrow escapes, and JAKE SPEED has been promoted that way using intelligent propaganda to make me and many others interested! Besides, I've never heard of the boy, so who needs his attention?
