OK, folks, honestly ... this must be one of the worst show-biz movies ever made, but I laughed silly myself (which may be why I liked it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and a way to get your personal 15 minutes of fame. Did I mention that sex was a big problem in this movie? If you have something for the bizarre characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and you have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** attention spoiler !!! *** The funniest thing about the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and show off his wallet with his love pictures. A triple A for bad taste and fun!
