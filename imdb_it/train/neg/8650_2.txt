If it hadn't been for an immature and naive idiot, I know that insisting that I watch this "documentary" I would never have seen this comedy! This film is full of bad scripts and funny moments. One in particular is where Afghan policemen / soldiers arrest Don Larson for shooting in the streets while allowing the cameraman to continue filming his arrest and then chase away, still recovering, presumably in his luxurious hotel. Then there is the scene where a car crashes into another car that has been turned over and parked nicely on the side of the road with no evidence that it is in an accident or explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised he currently has the score he has (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users made more sense.
