Okay, at first this movie looked pretty good to me even though it moved pretty fast and even though they only had a budget of $ 60,000 it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who could have killed her, why should you hunt him around and throw him a gun with a single bullet and waste it and end up running away from him all delayed and getting himself killed? Also after finding your dead sister in the lake and finding a clue and figuring out who the murderer was because you shouldn't hand over that clue to the police who thinks you killed her? And at the end of the film when he behaves like his sister who was a waitress and is talking to the villain he should have met him somewhere and recorded him saying he was dead and what happened to his "trial". I don't know that I wasn't happy with the ending. This movie could have been much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending hadn't sucked so bad! Don't waste your money on this film because if you do, I'll write a review here too and you won't be happy.
