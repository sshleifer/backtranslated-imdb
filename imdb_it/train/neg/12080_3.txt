I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I've been looking forward to seeing this episode. First I will comment on the film, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this film: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a budget of $ 1.25. Mix well, then drain from all life and movement, until it becomes opaque and lifeless. Serve cold in a large stone cauldron. Film, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors deserve at least a little credit. Ok, now the MST3K episode. I'll admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway. I understand that it was the reaction of several other sails. However, when I saw it a second time, I realized that there was a whole series of intelligent references and good jokes that I lost the first time. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes a couple of views to capture each line. Give it a second chance, and you'll see what I mean. MST3K episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
