Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for sunken treasures in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> Treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with grin on their hungry faces. Wilde and his merry must find a way to break away from the menu so they can start digging an old Spanish galleon full of gold bars. <br /> <br /> After the crew engaged in a small eternity of pushing, shoving, discussing and listening to the annoying advice on Wilde's health, 5 doomed madmen board the boat and complicate matters. Now it's a battle of wits over who gets the treasure and who can see how the inside of a shark's stomach looks. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is in good shape wearing exactly the same thing that 'The Naked Prey' was wearing, 10 years earlier, he remained in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made with a budget of 75 cents.
