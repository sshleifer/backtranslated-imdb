After the release of Cube 2: Hypercube (2003), and playing with the alleged success of the original Cube (1998), director Ernie Barbarash takes the liberty of bringing us the third chapter of the trilogy, the Cube Zero prequel. <Br /> <br /> Deep in the bowels of a giant and faceless institution, unknown time and place, two low-level operators, Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband) sit and observe behavior on monitors of the people who have been placed in a gigantic network of cubic chambers, some of which are rigged with deadly traps. Said that the people who are watching are convicted criminals who chose this horrible and deadly ordeal for a lethal injection, these observers had no problems with their work until Wynn, a mathematical genius, discovers that one of the prisoners, a woman named Cassandra (Stephanie Moore) never agreed to be put in the Cube. Suddenly you realize that perhaps their "jobs" are not what they seem, and that they could be part of something deeply sick and twisted ... <br /> <br /> For the people who have seen and appreciated the Original cube, this the prequel probably won't be to your liking. It is not that history has no potential; it's simply that the first Cube movie never needed to be expanded. Being alone, it is a small well-maintained psychological thriller with very interesting concepts and a certainty about one's message. He was also quite self-sufficient. The problem with Cube Zero is that it destroys part of the original mystique, trying to answer questions with more questions, but that in reality has only created a mess of what has never been necessary to fix. <br /> <br /> What this new film has to offer, which are questions about the psychological nature of authoritarianism and the banality of evil, certainly are good questions to ask, but probably should have been done so for their merits rather than a continuation of a film that had no such aspirations. <br /> <br /> That said, the other features of the film, such as acting, directing and writing, are not terrible. There is a dark and gloomy aspect of the film, similar to films like "The Matrix" and "Dark City", and they certainly managed to resume the claustrophobic feeling of the first Cube. Unfortunately for Barbarash, these aren't good enough to save him.
