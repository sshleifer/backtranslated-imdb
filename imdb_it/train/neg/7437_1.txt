This film is simply not worth the time or money spent. Full of clich√©s and a plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can't believe that so many people gave this terrible film a 10. My hypothesis is that they are the filmmaker's underlings. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I'd do it. Pity that IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I looked at it because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie to begin with, yet I soon felt changed. Take my word, don't waste your $ 8 on this piece of junk. The only entertainment I got from the movie was making fun of the director's name. In all, highly NOT RECOMMENDED!
