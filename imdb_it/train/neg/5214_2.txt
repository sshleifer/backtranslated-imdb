METAMORPHOSIS I'm making my way through the Chilling Classics 50 movie collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh film of the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS appears to be a remake of "The Atom Age Vampire", which also included a scientist looking for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror film. <br /> <br /> A university researcher is working to decipher the human genome in order to create a serum that prevents aging. Pressed by the administration to publish its documents; and, producing some results (or risking losing funds), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! Initially thinking of having no negative side effects, in the end he discovers that the serum has actually altered it in the most unexpected way! <br /> <br /> The acting is written; and the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is absurd. And the science behind the experiments and their discoveries is not only fallacious; is absurd; it's ridiculous ?? at best <br /> <br /> As others have noted, the end turns into a gag over 30 minutes, which is seemingly endless. Without giving too far, I would call this, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde meet the Creature from the Black Lagoon and meet alone."
