Essentially a story of man against nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor, but the film never really begins. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and is later attracted to the plantation foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of the late owner Peter Finch's father whose ghost throws a bullet on Elephant Walk which becomes an important point of contention between Taylor and Finch. Elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to the water that was blocked when the villa was built on their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage and provide the best moments of action in the photo. Taylor and Andrews have good times as they struggle to remain a faithful wife despite marital difficulties with Finch.
