As other reviewers have noted, the film dies in the last half hour. However, first he suffers from predictability and an incredibly dull performance of Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found his character and ruins all the scenes in which he finds himself. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most of the scenes are manipulated by effect rather than by truth that overlaps the whole with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The filmmakers apparently knew that when they put this mess together they just needed sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner, so to make up for it they added an exaggerated "dramatic" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point of becoming ridiculous. If you want an example of a bad movie series, this is one to see, otherwise skip it.
