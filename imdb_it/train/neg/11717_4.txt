A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as Leon, then other parts looked like another movie, I don't know which one, but there is a familiar feeling about the whole movie. It was nice to watch, but it would have been great! if the story would have been more original. The thematic girl, Leon's evil killer, has just improved. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in movies :-) My biggest problem was to remember which parts were of Leon, Nikita and whether they were of the French or American version. If you haven't seen Leon, then this is a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. Best regards / Rick
