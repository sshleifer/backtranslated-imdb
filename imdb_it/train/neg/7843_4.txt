This is a weak sequel: the interest and the light touch of the magnificent "Man Called Horse" is lacking in almost every aspect and, if compared to each other, they hardly seem to be of the same genus. <br /> <br /> The Return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different Indian ceremonies, but comes across trying too hard to bottle the magic of the first. In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, having lost their lands, modern life has invaded heaven and live in poverty and poverty. Perhaps this is the point: the first film took us to a place where we would like to be, a simpler time. This leads us to break the Indians into a miserable world and the white man is the hero and savior who rather denies the whole idea of ​​the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man learned and discovered that true civilization lies in values ​​rather than Western materialism. In the second film it's all, but it's missing and so we end up with a weak movie. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment.
