First of all there is the Gujarati Theater, then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and the following of the fans. The director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of the Gujarati Theater when he makes a Bollywood production. First he created Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati opera) - which had a unique plot, but which could not hold up like a Hindi film. Now he has adapted another representation of Gujarati and called it Waqt - a race against time. In short, emotions are alien. The development of the plot is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to the Gujarati Theater - don't take it in a Hindi movie. Even the comedy track is the best for the Gujarati stage. All the shows are average - nothing to scream - excluding Shefali Chhaya Shah which is fantastic.
