This was a strange kind of film about a low life in New York City and centered around a main character (the title, played by Brad Pitt) who thinks he's a Ricky Nelson type musician, except he doesn't have real talent. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch until a profane and stern woman in New York City with a horrible accent enters the scene and takes over. This ruined the film for me. It must have been Catherine Keener, who usually plays with stout women and with a mouth full of garbage. <br /> <br /> The hairstyle on Pitt - an exaggerated Pompadour - was fun to watch. I can imagine Johnny Depp playing this role better. One last note: it is strange to hear a film made in 1992 (different from that of Woody Allen) with a mono sound only.
