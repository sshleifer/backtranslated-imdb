I'm all for a "bad" horror movie but this was just a pile of dogs! How anyone can call this beautiful or decent movie is beyond me. If you like hasty editing to cover special effects, bad acting and a bad script, do it! There was no suspense and the gore factor was ridiculous because it was so fake. I'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek on this pile every day. My partner gave up after about 20 minutes, she knows a stinker when she sees one. On the other hand, I was stupidly watching the whole movie just to wait and see if it was better. Not much luck! I've never seen his other Torched movie and I doubt I'll be bothered now.
