Since Europe began fighting the Second World War, until the end of the war, Hollywood (with considerable encouragement from the government) made tons of films that were designed to try to enlist young men in the army , making the life of a mechanic seem "cool". This is by far the most foolish, implying that a soldier's life is jobless, you get the best food and you lie down all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio. I'm too young to have participated in the Second World War, but I think there was something else. There is the weakest mustache of a plot, and a bunch of musical numbers that represent some of the most important acts of the day. <br /> <br /> I think that in 1943 even the most naive civilized people knew that there was more abroad besides the extravagant hijinks portrayed in this film. While I am sure it had to be seen as entertainment for evasion, I cannot help wondering if the family and loved ones of the men fighting during the war were amused or rejected by this trivialization of the sacrifice of their loved ones.
