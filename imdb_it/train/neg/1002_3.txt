I don't want to go into too much detail, because I can't really justify the waste of time in the review of this film, but I had to give an alternative opinion hoping it would help people avoid the film. The animation is raw and the plot alternates between boring / useless, extremely irritating. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action movie or something - it's an attempt at slapstick comedy, and the humor didn't work after being translated. It was a thankless task to see this movie, and for me it was a horrible way to kick off the festival, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was to everything - I didn't expect a sequel to Ghost in the Shell, but was expecting something funny, and simply didn't get it. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Kino's journey instead.
