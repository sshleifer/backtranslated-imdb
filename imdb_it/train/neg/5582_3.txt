The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheavals and unrest were commonplace as people talked about their points of view. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam war, sexual promiscuity and drug use were all part of everyday life and daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into a funny, and largely successful, film. <br /> <br /> In this film, two families are followed: a white one, a black one. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on an equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second part of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. Of course, there are more characters in this family, and the lines of the story are mixed, but the racial aspects of this century are not given equal consideration. <br /> <br /> Overall, the acting is well done and historical the movie is mixed with the color and the original black and white movie to give the film a documentary touch. The film is a work of fiction, but the clips of famous historical figures are used to set the time line. <br /> <br /> I liked the film but the situations were predictable and the plot was one-way.
