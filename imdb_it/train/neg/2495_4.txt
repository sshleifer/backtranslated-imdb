The problem with this type of film is that literally dozens are made every year. Fortunately for use only a handful is given a theatrical version, while the others are pushed directly to video or TV, like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is actually its originality. It is one of those films that uses the "Die Hard" formula of a tough but troubled boy who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case it is a character played by Casper Van Dien, who works for a security agency that carefully verifies the security procedures for companies and individuals. In this case it is sent to a cruise ship, which is obviously diverted. You can see this film as a kind of mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and the film doesn't even try to hide that those two films were probably his biggest source of "inspiration". So really, you can't consider this film as original. Use all the clich√©s of the book and this film offers no surprise or something that remotely resembles something original. <br /> <br /> As you can expect from a movie like this, it has a very weak script. Or rather said, it presents a very lazy writing. As I said before, the film does not present anything original, but even the real story has some elements that are anything but truthful and are simply simple ridiculous sincerely. I mean, hijacking a huge cruise ship with only about 8 guys, to cut in half just bring some small guns and then demand a ransom of 'only' 10 million dollars, for a ship that is worth about 10 times that figure is already in itself quite ridiculous. How are they going to share that money later? Does every person get a little over a million or something? This is hardly profitable for such a large and risky business. And then there's the case of taking the passengers hostage. Somehow they manage to take all the passengers on the huge hostage ship and manage to put them in a room, with only one man with the gun, who doesn't even seem able to keep to the right, watching them. You never see more than 30 hostages, as if they were all the people on board at the time. Even when the character of Van Dien goes to look for his son and vice versa, regardless of which room they end up on the huge cruise ship, they always come across each other instantly. Just a few examples of lazy writing in the film. <br /> <br /> But of course it's an action movie, so the story obviously becomes secondary. But then again, it's not like this movie has some good action. Half of the actors seem to have never held a weapon and the film is full of some ridiculous ones in slow motion. It really gets ridiculous in points. <br /> <br /> Obviously the film also does not present the best actors, although I must say that Casper Van Dien is not really a bad "action hero" and actor, as far as the genre is concerned -movie. However, he also suffers from the same problem as Tom Cruise; no matter how old he is, he never seems convincing enough to play the father of a teenager. Once Van Dien was promised as a promising young actor, but in films like this it doesn't help his career much. He is probably capable of something better, even if he is never really offered the right opportunity to prove it. All the other actors also do a fairly fair job, but their characters are so formidable that they never get really interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh well, it's not the worst genre movie I've ever seen but it's also exactly the most original or memorable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
