As an avid Cary Grant fan, I expected to watch this movie and howl with a laugh, as AMC advertised it as a comedy. I've never been more disappointed with a movie! The usual charm of Cary and his effortless comedy are totally absent in this film; he shows himself tense, bored, and not just himself. The character of Mississip ranks among one of the worst stereotypes I've ever witnessed: her accent is terribly exaggerated (and unfair, depending on which part of the Mississippi she claims to greet), and every time she delivers a line, they are several decibels taller than any other cast member. Mississip tried to get herself noticed in the film as a much-loved goofball country, but in the end she only managed to belittle the already weak plot. Mansfield looks more like an obscene inflatable doll than a Hollywood cat, and although she has never been known in Hollywood for her acting ability, this movie screams that she never had that skill to begin with. The character of Ray Walston was sugary and eventually artificial. For four men on leave, it was the best vacation I've ever seen. I saw this nightmare until its end, and while I won't ruin it for anyone, I'll tell you it's the most absurd you've ever seen. The film tries to trigger patriotism and a sense of debt towards the fighting men, but the film misses this point totally because of its weak plot and its weak cast. Sorry, Cary!
