For faithful Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to become creative and make this 1980s video something of a science fiction story, involving Barbarella's wicked villain from whom the group took its name. <br /> <br /> What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great songs from the 80s by Duran Duran, confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the imaginary antagonist who tries to stop band in one of their concerts. Not only is good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer through a low-cost spin-off story offered by an evil Dr. Mario. It's almost too much to bear. 2/10
