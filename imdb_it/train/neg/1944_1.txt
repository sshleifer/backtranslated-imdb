I grew up with Scooby doo all my life, my father grew up with scooby doo. We have just seen the first episode of the disguise called Shaggy and Scooby have a clue. Which planet are the Warner Bros in allowing this mess to arrive on the air. The characters could have been better designed by my younger sister. The story could have been written better by my 3-year-old twin cousins ​​(also their Scooby Doo fans). Scooby and Shaggy are not !!!!! if anyone, except Casey Kasem, makes Shaggy's voice, people won't work !!!! trust me. <br /> <br /> This program was shameful. What's new Scooby Doo is much better. Why change a winning format. Bin this piece of junk and get back to the real Scooby
