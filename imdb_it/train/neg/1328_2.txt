This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: the action comedy. Conceptwise resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, laughter and harmony between the main characters of that movie. Let them know that I like Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he can't act. It's terrible when he tries to behave hard - he can barely keep that branded smile out of his face as he says his lines, which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing it run (even then) is not a pleasant sight. Furthermore, I have the feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - does not give the politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even let me start the story. I give him a 2 out of 10.
