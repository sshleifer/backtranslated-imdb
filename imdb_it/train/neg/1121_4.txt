In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we learn that Krabbe is a gay alcoholic writer who sleeps without underwear, fantasizing about the murder of his roommate, trying to steal a magazine from a newsstand, and wants a young scholar he meets in the train station. And he is the hero of this nonsensical film that is all dressed up (except Krabbe in at least one scene too), but he has nowhere to go. The basic plot is very simple but is dragged for about two hours before reaching a useless conclusion. Verhoeven looks good, but uses scenes of wild hallucinations, overt symbolism and cold blood when he ends his ideas.
