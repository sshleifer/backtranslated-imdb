I only saw it because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and played Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed. <br /> <br /> The idea that the convicted prisoners would fight to the death for the television rankings was exaggerated with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner and the new movie, Death Race, which will surely suck because he plays Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> This was just a bore for most. The "Kill Bike" action was ridiculous. The "training" was a snooze-fest. He just never grabbed me and made me want to worry about anyone, including the "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others mentioned and you'll be better off.
