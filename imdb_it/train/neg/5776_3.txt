bad acting, bad southern accents, inconsistent cinematography, horrible screenplay ... <br /> <br /> I couldn't wait to see this movie at a recent film festival and I was so discouraged after seeing it. Contains quoted / unquoted name talents, but does not deliver. Of course the basis of all this is the uneven and uninteresting story being told. <br /> <br /> do not disturb
