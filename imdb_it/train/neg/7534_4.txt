A mom tells cartoons about men, women and sex between them. Eh? At first, the mother randomly asks the viewer: "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this guy" about 37 times, while flashing images of young half-naked mods. Later, he said that the boys mods pelt mod girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or fast forward) through the wandering moms, the shorts are not bad in themselves. I found some of them quite funny. My favorite is one in which the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his lizard sits on the bed. This is one, well, a bizarre movie.
