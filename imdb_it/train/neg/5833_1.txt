3 lbs is obviously just a self-indulgent program for Stanley Tucci for being a deeply moody producer / doctor. Unlike House, he has absolutely no personality and, unlike Grey's Anatomy, brain surgery cases are not even interesting. This program should be set in a leading neurological case center - but there is nothing interesting or exciting! Not even the so-called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show or even those hallucinations. In the pilot there was a brief look at the social life of the leads like a father - a nap! boring and useless. <br /> <br /> This show is in underwear, at the moment there is an excess of medical dramas and this does nothing that makes it stand out as special.
