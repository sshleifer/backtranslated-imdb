Before the Internet this film could never have been realized, but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind it. Unfortunately this has been ... the general opinion that nowadays the Web in squeezed hands can create as much chaos as anything else in real life. Since the late 1990s someone has discovered that it is possible to create a virus that could disable a computer. The point? Just to do something simply evil with the remote control and therefore the cyberequivalent of the theft with violence. This is basically what spam is without violence - it makes you angry with your money and it's going so long that it's surprising that no one notice it nowadays so that they become smarter and use real names as doing something illegal is not a priority, we see the Internet getting worse from week to week - social networking sites or chat rooms that lead to evil and pornographic sites that are illegal. So the idea of ​​a movie that invites people to click on a name is just the same old thing - actually there is a site called Horrorvision which is a porn site - but this kills the people who enter its portals. But history is so disconnected that it is boring and does not reach any conclusion. The final film on this subject of destroying an Internet service provider has yet to be done, but clearly many need to be destroyed as they will not be closed when there is money to be made. Calling it a horror movie is rather misleading because it doesn't bore you
