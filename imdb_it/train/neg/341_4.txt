Oh God. If you want to give your Crow T. Robot a real workout, this is the movie to put in the old VCR. The potential for cut-up lines in this film is endless. <br /> <br /> (Some spoilers later.) Hey, do you really care if a film of this quality is "ruined?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for this when a child develops a sexual crush on the parent of the opposite sex. But this girl seems to have one for her own sex, and I don't think there's a deadline for that. It could be because his mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose exuberant sympathy, neo-flower flower sexuality and sensual figure makes me forgive any number of bad movies or unpleasant characters. Here Dana is not only unaware of his daughter's conduct; seems to be competing for the gold medal in the mother's indulgent Olympic competition. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana misses Traci's murderous series because, to tell the truth, Traci seems to have the criminal abilities of a hamster. It's only because the screenplay dictates so that she can get any kind of body count. <br /> <br /> A particularly exhilarating note in this film is the character of Carmen, a Mexican waitress who is described by Dana as having been for so long a family, even if she dresses in what the director thought he would have said: "I just fell off the truck of tomatoes from Guadalajara". Carmen is so wise for Traci's intrigues, she could even wear a sign that says, "Hey, I'm the next victim!" Sure enough, Traci confronts Carmen while Carmen is coming back from Mass, and rejects her with one of those slightly angled spring-loaded keys that carmakers put next to your spare parts like a bad joke. I suspect rather than in real life those things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another sequence, Arquette wears a light dress for a vineyard, under a cloudy sky, talking to the owner. Cut them in another light dress under the sunny skies, talking to the owner's brother. Then cut it with the first dress, in the first position, under a cloudy sky - but it should be later. Get the picture. We are talking about bad direction. <br /> <br /> As for leather, don't expect much, even if Traci has a nice pair of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for a garbage, 8. For anyone else, 1/2.
