As I write this review in 2008, we are stuck in a culture of remake. The movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as possible with absolutely useless updates including "King Kong", "The Wicker Man" and pretty much every movie I've ever starred in Michael Caine. This mentality of lazy remakes is not a new phenomenon, however, as "Dough for do-do" shows. A colorful version of Bob Clampett's surreal "Porky in Wackyland" documentary, "Dough for the Do-Do" sucks life from the original by spraying color on all of Clampett's original footage and adding some new lame movies supervised by Friz Freleng. Freleng was a director entirely unfit to tamper with Clampett's source material, although in reality no director could hope to approach Clampett's inspired madness. Inevitably, therefore, "Dough for the Do-Do" is nothing but the rape of a classic with a new and frightening title attached. For comic book fans like me, it's equivalent to a "Casablanca" colorization.
