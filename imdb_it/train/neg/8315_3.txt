What a wasted opportunity to make an interesting film on a complicated topic. There is very little exploration of what really seems to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers continue to talk about their art as if it didn't have an erotic component. They may not all be hired prostitutes, but in fact they are prostitutes who play fantasies and sell private sessions where more than one dance is offered. The film gives the impression that they are aimed primarily at women who attend gay clubs and then end up hiring "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club show only the women in front of the stage and the "dancers" play only for women in the audience. This is not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to make a living doing private dances for heterosexual women and couples. So what do they really think about their admirers and gay customers? We learn very little. Instead we fill ourselves. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of heterosexual dancers. A manager who talks about costumes for acts of resistance but does not offer information on the lives and attitudes of dancers. <br /> <br /> Mexico City photos are generic. The phallic montage showing the roasted sausage is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a totally simplistic film that should only interest those who want to see some photos of handsome guys dancing. The rest of the film is an insult to gays.
