ok. for beginners, the taxi driver is incredible. this, this is not the taxi driver or incredible. what it is is bad but I thought it was funny, which means it had some positive qualities. like dialogue ... wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the film was a sermon. there were some places where I thought that the film would be immersed in the violence of a taxi driver, which would hit the message at the end of the film on the head much more difficult. I can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yes, it is worth looking at if you are really bored and you want to reiterate that anyone can make a film, or at least can try to do it.
