Have they used their entire budget by paying porn stars or what?!? <br /> <br /> Sound effects, background music and editing in general were so ugly that you thought a 12-year-old would have liked the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting was good considering the script ... the "innocent virgin" played her part very well. <br /> <br /> The mutants seem really fantastic and this could actually have been a really interesting movie with the right brain at the wheel ... but, unfortunately for everyone involved, it is not. <br /> <br /> Turn Left was made better of this movie and those guys didn't do it I even have money !!! Fortunately, I didn't rent the movie alone!
