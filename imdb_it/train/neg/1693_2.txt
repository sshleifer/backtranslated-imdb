My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie fans we are. Two hours later I found myself wishing for both my money and my time. I was so disappointed. The teasers of this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film except good timing on surprise entries, etc. I found most of the "scary" parts more comical than anything else. Having seen other films based on the works of Japanese writers, I must conclude that what is considered terrifying in Japan is not what is scary here in the United States. My advice: if you are a fan of real horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through it. I can't really say I'd recommend renting it, unless you have a free rent for you.
