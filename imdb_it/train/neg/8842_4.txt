Somehow it says that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed a film in their entire IMDb career and yes, you guessed it, that movie is "Parasomnia". I have often suspected good reviews on IMDb suspiciously for what turns out to be a film far from good as sneaky marketing, but in this case it seems quite transparent. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops short of being the good or great movie that has the potential to be. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, he has a big bad guy in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting threatening and evil, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable villain like Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful images in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain it could have been something better. The true concept of subtle abuse of hypnosis is also very beautiful. <br /> <br /> Although I understand that the suspension of disbelief is necessary to immerse yourself in every good story, it is the mark of a good story that manages to get you done. If you feel annoyed by what you find illogical or simply silly, then the story is losing you and that's what happened to me with this movie. The other reviewers mentioned this here and I don't want to enter the spoiler territory, but I will say that the final setup was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention the different mental age of a character who is supposed to have only experienced a few years of life. <br /> <br /> All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in a diabolically abused hypnotism, but unfortunately this film fails to make it into something special.
