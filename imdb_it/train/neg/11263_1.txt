For shame, for the shame that a good actor like Joseph Fiennes would let himself be thrown into this piece of nauseating fool. The film was not only ugly, but in the end it was horrible and lacking in salvific quality. The plot, (was there?) He seemed not to go where. The Russians have played silly killings or killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared invalid for their pathetic performance. I gave up about 3/4 and turned it off. A "1" for horrible just because there is nothing lower. Don't waste time with this, you won't miss anything.
