I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And after seeing Mongol, which is absolutely fantastic, and which I highly recommend, I had great expectations from a film by Sergei Bodrov. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie was waiting for me to have something exciting going on, but it didn't happen, so in the end I was expecting at least one great epic battle, but even that was a huge disappointment, just a little casual running, waving swords. .. There are so many good warrior films, this is not one of them.
