Rob Schneider is a famous comedy of his movements, facial treatments and "non-human" shows. This time it's The Animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody gets a call from a man being attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes into his car and gets really sick. He does not remember what happens and on the next ordinary day, his life is not the same when he discovers he has an animal instinct. Of course, we have our female that our main character is trying to reach, but her attempts are useless. It is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal human again. By the way - his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The film is so unreal that it becomes stupid at times, but it is one of those films, called mindless fun, as I wrote above. So watch it for the Rob Schneider monkey style but it's definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best films in which Schneider appears. He is a great comedian but he is not his best film.
