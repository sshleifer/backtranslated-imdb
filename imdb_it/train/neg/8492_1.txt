If you do it through the opening credits, this could be your kind of movie. From the image of the first screen of a woman holding her hands on her face with white sheets rising in the background, we recall a pretentious advertisement about perfume. It's all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> The leading actress is basically a block of wood that uses her computer to reach the past and reconstruct the memories of the photographs, to talk about the neglected genius of history, Ada, who conceived the first language for computers in the 1800s. <br /> <br /> Low-budget graphics would be forgivable if it were interesting, or even an integral part of the script. <br /> <br /> Poor Tilda Swinton is wasted.
