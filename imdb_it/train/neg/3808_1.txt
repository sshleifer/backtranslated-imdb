WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop". If you don't want to know how the film ends, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you think "Annie Hall" was a stroke of luck. <br /> <br /> Get a star because you can see the bare chest of Hugh Jackman. This is the only thing "Scoop" intends to do. <br /> <br /> The misogyny of Woody Allen, and his fixation on young enough women at this point to be his niece, have paralyzed every chance to make movies that could <br /> <br /> La plot seems promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, directs Scarlett Johansson, a soft-headed student, to investigate whether a famous English Lord, Hugh Jackman, is the infamous Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes. A wizard, Woody Allen, helps the girl. Despite the promising plot, the film completely lacks charm, humor or atmosphere. It is an incredibly leaden and amateurish effort for someone who has even made just one previous film, regardless of dozens. Perhaps Allen had a stroke that was not reported in the press. <br /> <br /> Much is made of the fact that, contrary to his previous films, Woody Allen, now a seventy year old, has FINALLY allowed a young protagonist to take the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is built in such a way that the girl gets no one. <br /> <br /> There is a first scene in which Johansson, for no fundamental reason for the film, lets himself get drunk, and seduced, by a powerful and older director. "Sedotto" is a euphemism for what happens. It's a "slam, bam, I have to go" kind of moment. It has no relation to the plot, and is very expensive for Johansson in the eyes of the viewer. Why did Allen add that useless scene to the movie? Because it shows a powerful director, like Allen, having sex with the female lead. Allen gets to have his cake and she eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. He doesn't know how to control the screen unless he is wearing a tight and low shirt. Imitates Allen in a couple of scenes, and it just looks strange and sad. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that your character is scripted as a doll that can't function without a ghost, or an elder and less than a wizard who inspires awe, telling her what to do at every turn. <br /> <br /> It has about half the age of Jackman and comes across a very vague screen presence in their scenes together. > <br /> Members of the public not obsessed by the breast deserve better in their heroines, and even Jackman deserves better: a script that gives the heroine intelligence and skill, and an actress who can transmit those qualities. <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is similarly tricked by the script. Apparently, Allen can't stand that Jackman is so extraordinarily handsome and young, and therefore doesn't give Jackman anything to say or do. Like Johansson, it is used only for its good looks. This is a pity, because, as Jackman showed in any number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can act. <br /> <br /> Here's the big twist - Jackman, suave, charming English gentleman, he really is a murderer. So even though the film says it's all about allowing someone else, in addition to Allen, to take the girl, she doesn't get anyone. Jackman, the man he made love to, is a man who killed a prostitute. Bello, Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your reach. <br /> <br /> In an aggressive passive touch, Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence, also killing his character, the magician, leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> A final note: at my screening, not a single member of the audience laughed at any time during the film. Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy.
