This was released by Alpha on the DVD market, and it is only for die-hard Boris Karloff fans (like moi). It is not a horror film, but a drama in which Boris is a scientist in difficulty who agrees to kill the husband of a wealthy woman in order to get the luck necessary to continue his work. But once the dying victim changes his will and leaves nothing to his spouse, hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> It is quite satisfying to see Karloff as another sinister selfish guy, and part of the acting is unintentionally exhilarating (especially by the protagonist Mona Goya, who is a real laugh of laughter like a double crossed wife) ). <br /> <br /> But proceed with great caution.
