Sorry: this movie is just a cheap TV production. I have seen a lot of promotional material and I expect a professional film like "Stormriders" - what was presented to me was a low budget film like "XENA" or "Hercules" on TV. No Atmosphere, very boring fight scenes, more than worse. Some good ideas - no more. I hope to have the chance to make a film like this and then I'll show you how to make a movie !!!! <br /> <br /> My ASIAN recommendations: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
