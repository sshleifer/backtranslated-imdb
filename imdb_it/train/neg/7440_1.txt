She will be recorded as a second person who, after years of using IMDb to search for movies, was motivated by Nacho's The Abandoned, to create an account and post a comment. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the "pieces of the puzzle" added up in any way. The acting was ridiculous and the writing was embarrassing. The way in which this film was supported and arrived is completely beyond me. The only redeeming thing was the cunning and repetitive use of Anastasia Hille of the word f. (and a brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the possibility of seeing this movie again or being caught in a fistfight trap, I would be faced with a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I can't give him 0 stars.
