This film is a rewrite of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", but was written for the comic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life has expired and works with God's representative, Mr. King, to return to earth as someone else. Like in the Beatty movie; chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he imagines Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who shows up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea of ​​turning an old white aged millionaire into a standing black comedian trying to woo Sontee just doesn't work. Even the interconnections used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real "white" Wellington, fail miserably. Improvements could be made to the original Beatty plot - which in itself did not represent masterly the idea of ​​life after death - but certainly not found in "Down To Earth".
