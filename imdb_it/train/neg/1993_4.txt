The 1985 Italian mini-series of Quo Vadis by Franco Rossi in 1985 is a very curious beast, which creates an absolutely convincing Roman world filmed in terms of fashion (a few long shots, no large urban landscapes), but playing the drama so much in favor of the allusions to classical literature and history that history is constantly lost in the background. <br /> <br /> The changing structure (much of episode 1 is reproduced via voice over letter) and the lack of narrative urgency makes the full six-hour version simultaneously demanding and non-binding, and certainly too often not engaging, but it has something to do for it. The two main strengths are the characterization of Petronius (a Frederic Forrest nicknamed fortunately, whose voice almost certainly flatten his dialogue) as a man whose so much time has been spent searching for a clever angle to survive the life of court has become incapable of feeling emotions, and the unique interpretation of Klaus Maria Brandauer on Nero as an aspiring actor that his every move and action is calculated on how his "audience" will receive him. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow appears briefly in a few episodes, being rewarded with the most impressive and truly moving scene of the show here he meets a child as he tries to leave Rome. It's the kind of thing the show could do with more than, but it seems too often to flatten every potentially emotional, challenging or exciting moment under the relentlessly low-key direction. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Francesco Quinn makes an incredibly anonymous hero, who blends in with the walls and looks less like a Roman officer than that quiet, a bit gormless but inoffensive who works in the same office as you who never says a lot about office parties - you know, what you think is called Dave or something. The budgetary limitations are very visible once the time to Meet the Lions for Christians and Ursus fights with the bull is so decisively low that it passes over you before the show suddenly loses interest and ends suddenly. <br /> <br /> They are not a trip that I can recommend particularly, I'm afraid, but if you embark on it it is not entirely without its small advantages.
