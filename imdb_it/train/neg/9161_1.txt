... well, open this DVD, you lose an hour and a half of your life that you will never come back and find out. <br /> <br /> Acting? What acting? <br /> <br /> Productive values? ...Production? ... Values? <br /> <br /> History? Don't get me started. <br /> <br /> After many years of publishing on IMDb, I never thought I would see a movie so bad that I really wanted a lower score than one. Have I always found at least one reason or two to see the merit - if only in the intent or effort of the writer, director, cast or producer? <br /> <br /> In this case, they "is the same guy (!) who really needs to get an idea of ​​the fact, at least as demonstrated by this useless waste of video tape, which has no talent. to say that it would be a reasonable excuse if this was the "production" of a young high school student for his first film lesson, but the "reference" artist behind this drach was twenty six at the time of this abortion. <br /> < br /> How has it ever been done? Anyone in their right mind has ever written a check for this? Also, don't be fooled by the box: there is nothing remotely resembling a good sex scene or a good "exposure "of the piece on that cover. <br /> <br /> Two final elements: there was a second when this" film "had the value of redemption: the aforementioned" talent "was punched at the top of its lung by its lover. ! And, I learned something from this "movie." There are times when something is so serious that it really is very funny. But not in a comical way; it's just sadly funny. Very sadly funny.
