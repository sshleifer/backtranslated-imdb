It may have been a wonderful story based on the ancient Cat People races, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> This work could have been just that; wonderful and full of mythological references that have fueled my fascination. The main characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were shallow, had no depth of personality and were hardly funny or attractive. Not even the character of MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson) suited that description. <br /> <br /> However, as I have said many times before, adapting a Stephen King novel for TV, you simply have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for TV, and his script is talent sadly it lacks the fire and depth it exposes as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another failed attempt to take the magic of Stephen King's writing, whether it's his novels or an original script. To simply cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely basted and everything you end up creating is a good film; nothing less, but certainly nothing more. His scripts are uncertain. Unfortunately, this translation of the script was a lack. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry movie. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
