Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic films (just look at the Academy Award nominations every year). But still, the good ones are really an art form. Check out "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle" and classics like "Roman Holiday" and "It Happened One Night". I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This film attempts to build something that looks like a romantic comedy. But nobody believes the love story between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make up for this serious gap. Modine is far beyond being a leading man, especially a romantic protagonist. I am sure that, as an executive producer, he had the means, but not common sense, to express himself. And Gershon ... I see the possibility of some comic talent, but he had no script and a badly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Nonsense. <br /> <br /> Others have said it, but I want to repeat: this story is ill-conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly uncomfortable; and the characters, well, they don't give a damn. <br /> <br /> An art form is not like that. Go again "Moonstruck".
