Slow and pleasant images have changed with each other, with music sometimes annoying (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the film. If you haven't slept enough, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But, in the last 20% of the director, he decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, reincarnation or other, through the images S & M: "spiritual lovers" are cutting each other's bodies with the knives. For me it was very disturbing and actually changed the general impression of mixing abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> Operator and director are fantastic, but bizarre. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it at all.
