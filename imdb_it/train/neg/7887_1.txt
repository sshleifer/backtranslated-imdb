... then they will have the right place to store this shit. Sorry, it is not a "mystery", as claimed, it is a religious mumbo-jumbo. I kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised to me, but the "evil" in this film would have been unimaginable only for a five-year-old with learning difficulties. <br /> <br /> I can't believe we actually managed to find some bigger names willing to get involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately it changed my opinion about them forever, and I will probably avoid whatever they do in the future. I'm also a little disappointed that I now have the name of a writer and the name of the director to memorize, because I will avoid anything they do like the plague from now on. <br /> <br /> It's really unpleasant that all the religious fanatics who post here and say that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will receive their first published reviews. This could lead to more and more people being tricked into believing that this film was something other than religious preaching. <br /> <br /> Well, it's out for the video store to get my money back for misleading advertising. Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I lost by looking at it thinking it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural movie.
