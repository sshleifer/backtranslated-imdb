I don't know what would be great in this movie. Even worse, why would anyone care to see this? First of all there is no history. It could be said that even without a story a film could be worth seeing because it invokes a kind of strong feeling (laughter, tears, fears, ...), but in my opinion this film doesn't do it either. <br /> <br /> You're just looking at the images for +/- 2 hours. There are other useful things to do. <br /> <br /> I think we can say that the film is an experiment and is bold because all of the above is missing. But is it worth 2 hours of your precious time and 7 EUR of your money? For me the answer is: no.
