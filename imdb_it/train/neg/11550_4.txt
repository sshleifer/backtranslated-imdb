I knew I was going to watch a low budget movie, but I expected a lot more from an Alex Cox movie. The acting of the two main men was terrible, especially the white boy. The girl should have won an Oscar with respect to those two. This film was filled with what I imagine would be in jokes for people in the film industry and some other lines that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud, which is rare. Without these moments of laughter, I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox who made all the classics of the 80s? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a couple of questions I asked after the movie was finished. Why did the Mexican go to the other guy's house at the beginning? What did your daughter say that she had 100 people laid off from her last job? Why was he breaking his own things when he was angry with him? I think I should have gone to the Q&A after the movie, but I didn't want to get up at 10am.
