Sky Captain is probably the best horrible movie I've seen in a long time. Rife with a fantastic CG and special effects, studded with an A-list cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and the infinitely cute Giovanni Ribisi) and running together with an exaggerated plot but with the Indiana Jones style, he should have been a great movie to watch. <br /> <br /> "You should have" the key term here, of course. <br /> <br /> Jude Law interprets Joe the Sky Captain with a catchy accent and a lot of over-the-big smile, moving smiles, but you can't create something out of nothing, and even its essential deliveries and appearance youth can not save the stone dialogue of the film. (If he had beaten Giovanni Ribisi on his back and said, "Good boy, Dex," just another time, I could have let off steam on the whole boy in front of me.) Gwyneth Paltrow, like Polly Perkins, is nothing but a nervous network . His plaintive and not quite sarcastic nasal comments age in the first ten minutes of the film. Maybe he put too much energy into playing the stereotypical comic strip heroine of the 1930s - who knows? I expected more from her. An example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90s movie "The Phantom", with Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane. Rent the movie and you will understand what I mean. <br /> <br /> Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the graces saved in the film. (Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eye patch. I admit it.) In a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to overcome the tired material and offer a more compelling performance than their two-dimensional brown casts. <br /> <br /> The plot and the constant progression of the story were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie over the last thirty years. The pace is rapid in the first half of the film, and the pace of a snail in the second, giving the public enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to understand who the bad key is. The mating is rather trivial, even - Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently find themselves after several years of separation from a bitterly over love story, and their story is not as fascinating and eclectic as it is annoying and not corresponding. When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody is surprised, and nobody really cares. <br /> <br /> Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloring. But Sky Captain, despite having all the essential elements to be a great film, falls to the ground. It was not even worth the $ 2.75 I paid to enter the theater.
