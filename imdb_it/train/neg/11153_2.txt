Another in a long series of gestures made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is like telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the whole premise is exposed in a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates an entire aspect of suspense. The only competent actor halfway is killed for 10 minutes in the film, so we were left with stupid characters that went around doing stupid things. Low-budget films can't afford expensive special effects, so CGI portions aren't surprisingly unimpressive, but they were at least a valid attempt. The creature's dress is terrible, as seen when it falls on the pavement, and the director continues to emphasize his eyes, which are not even the red color shown in the mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The last sequence of actions takes place in a police station, also a rip off from the Terminator, with everyone hiding in the only glass-clad office that the Darkwolf can't break through. In the end, the girl calls the hero "a good Protector", but gets both his companions, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen policemen, all killed without getting a decent shot, in despite an arsenal of silver bullets and a machine gun. But here is the real point of reference for bad writing: they could have killed the beast immediately after the credits when he held the stripper while his red eyes were flashing. Instead, they took it into custody?!?
