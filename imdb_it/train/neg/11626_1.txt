This could be the worst show I've ever seen. Apart from the blandness of having a Hitler sitcom, it's not funny or fun in any way. It's very similar to a 1950s sitcom in his cornball humor and contrived situations, but while it can be well done as in I Love Lucy, it's not funny at all here. I think the show was based on the novelty "look, it's Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure", but it has simply fallen into every aspect. The boy who plays Hitler is so fond of it that it is difficult to be able to sit alone. I wonder what might have made you think this was a good idea for air. I thought America had a bland show, but the British had beaten us this time. America would never air a Hitler sitcom, although we had that show about Lincoln's slave, Desmond Pfeiffer's The Secret Diary. You will probably never see this show, since only one episode has been broadcast and it will probably never be released on DVD.
