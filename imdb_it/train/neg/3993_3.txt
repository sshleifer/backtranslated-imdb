This film was exactly what I expected, not exceptional, but also not so bad. In my opinion, PG13 movies are not scary enough, which is why I already knew that I would get bored throughout the film. Certainly there were scary things in the hotel room, but nothing that we hadn't seen before. I guess I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists happening; it has become old and repetitive. I also didn't know if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room were real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The film drags on and when it finally ends you want to continue, because you're still waiting for someone to tell you what the whole movie is about. What I like was the special effects. Apart from that, there wasn't much fun on his part. Maybe it's just me but I thought it was below average.
