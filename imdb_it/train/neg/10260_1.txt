This movie was terrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I saw the first 5 minutes and the film and I knew it was a bomb. The acting was ugly and there was no plot. The monster is terribly false. the mouth does not move. Also, he should have a doctor who plays a xylophone to kill the monster. Simply bad don't waste time (1 in 10)
