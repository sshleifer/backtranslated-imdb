I saw this movie in a sneak preview and I'm glad I didn't pay it. This film is simply disgusting. It is full of lines of fart and fart and is not fooled by action sequences (like the shooting in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things I liked in the movie .. and many of them disagree. <br /> <br /> 1. The penis of Dave Foley. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The lines of Poop. 4. The Dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Taliban 7. Again making fun of Bush .. WE GET IT THAT IT IS AN IDIOT .. go ahead. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The plot. 10. Killing Minors 11. There was Uwe Boll. 12. Most of the cast were just outrages and out there. <br /> <br /> Now the (few) good <br /> <br /> 1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer as in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a comeback (and a cameo from the manufacturer of Postal) 4. Um ... I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few moments "what the ef" <br /> <br /> Boll did again. He made another crappy game in film adaptation. Congratulations to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
