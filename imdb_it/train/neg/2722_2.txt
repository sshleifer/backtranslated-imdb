For the great thinkers of us, "The Intruder" is an incoherent and incoherent film from France, which gives the so-called "art films" a bad name. The story is about a bitter old coot, Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), who goes to Tahiti to look for a heart transplant, but beyond that, I have no idea who the people in the film were or why they were doing what they were doing. Without a coherent plot to brag about, the film soon loses us, even if I am perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEONE out there who actually gets a profound message from this film. <br /> <br /> This confusing drama, at a snail's pace, lasts two hours and five full minutes, although I seriously doubt that anyone with some form of life will continue to hang around in the credits.
