The first was different and fun. This attempt should never have left the studio. This movie doesn't make you laugh. It is a weak attempt at coarseness. The film chooses current and old films to be torn. This time the lines seem used and exaggerated. The audience that saw it only acted in Hannibal's dinner scene and was otherwise asleep.
