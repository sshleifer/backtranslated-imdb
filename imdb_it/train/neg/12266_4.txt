The images of the Republic arrive late in the game to the "werewolf" genus Werecat. The plot has a writer who returns to Paris after a long journey abroad during which he developed the fear of the jungle during which he had blackouts. He is coming to great acclaim like his novel which, in parallel with an infamous process, is a best seller. The French government wants to know if it has access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a "catman". Suspicion really falls on the writer when his boyfriend ends up dead. Complicating things is the return of blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not. <br /> <br /> The thriller of agreement is too easy to fully enjoy. There are too many musical numbers in the early stages and too much downtime when things are all in between and in later sections. The acting is fine and the sets are pretty good, but there's a reason why most people I know just remember the top hat killer, that's the most interesting thing about this movie. despite the short execution time (just over an hour), I think the reason this film was rarely seen on TV is that after 20 minutes you start losing patience with it. As good as it is, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the final minutes, it was too little late .. <br /> <br /> Take a ride.
