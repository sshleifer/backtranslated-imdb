First of all, I have to say that I worked for the blockbuster and saw a lot of movies to the point that it's hard for me to find something that I haven't seen. Taking this into account, I want everyone to know that this film was by far the worst movie ever made, that introduced me to Lilies, My Boss's Daughter and any other piece of trash you've ever seen. BeLyt must be out of his mind, I found only one person who liked it and even they couldn't tell me what the movie was about. If you are able to decipher this film and are able to tell me what it is, you have to be the writer or a fortune teller because there is another way a person could understand this crap. <br /> <br /> FOR GD'S LOVE YOU'RE AWAY!
