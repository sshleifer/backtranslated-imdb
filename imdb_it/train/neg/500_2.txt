The Bloodsucker drives the dance - what a ridiculous title, it is absolutely misleading. It is not surprising that filmmakers try and deceive us, because this is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a murder in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this film. And when something awakens the spectator from his torpor, invariably it is an involuntary comedy, in the form of a terrible dialogue by a group of hopeless voice artists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors who deliver the voices to look like a group of defectives. It is really difficult to determine how bad acting is when it duplicates this abyssal. But voice-artists can't be blamed for the script. It's a parody. Unwittingly funny at best, pathetic in the worst case. History in general is, to say the least, irregular. The female characters are particularly idiotic; men are either fearful or boring. <br /> <br /> The whole company knows of pure exploitation of the public. It does not remotely transmit what it promises and even when the murders (finally) start happening, they all happen off the screen. All we get is a couple of head-to-head shots. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that this film is a mystery. I cannot be less in agreement with this opinion. Anyone who loves Italian thrillers should give this film a wide space because there's nothing electrifying. It's basically a soft-core porn movie with a horror corner. But it's not even very erotic. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend it to anyone.
