Of course, I'm not the connoisseur of my partner's horror, but a nice shot, a smart coup of the hand is worth it. My quibbles, in short: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue often weak and sometimes unbelievable coming from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Unconvincing acting. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never really caught fire. <br /> <br /> The writers have torn pieces chosen from half a dozen traditional films, thrown into a kettle, slowly boiled not enough and have tried to feed us with poor scholars, the consequent disorder, to the party. /> <br /> Long and short, though not absolutely terrible, it was definitely not worthy of absorbing one of my NetFlix rents.
