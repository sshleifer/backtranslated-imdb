I haven't read a biography of Lincoln, so maybe this was an accurate portrait ... And maybe it's because I'm used to the equally alienating and unrealistic portraits of worship that unnaturally deify Lincoln as brilliant, honorable and savior of our country .... .. <br /> <br /> But why would they make a film that represented Lincoln as a fool? While Henry Fonda was an excellent Lincoln, his portrait of him as an "aw shucks, I'm just a simple boy" seemed a bit offensive. <br /> <br /> [Granted, that was the whole Bushie Jr. campaign, to make us think he was "just a normal guy", so we wouldn't care that he was a rich and privileged moron - but this is all a 'other story.] <br /> <br /> Not only does the film show Lincoln as a kind of simple (almost simple) guy, the film claims that Lincoln has just entered the law by mistake, and that he wasn't even that interested to the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of ​​the law does it concern rights and wrongs. In the film he is not an excellent defense lawyer (he sits down with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the result is largely determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, in part because this was funded by the Republicans (in reaction to some of the games sponsored by the Democrats that had come out) and partly because it was just the feeling of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist and conservative. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie!
