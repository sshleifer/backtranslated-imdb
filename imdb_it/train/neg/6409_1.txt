I just saw this movie yesterday ... I can't believe the reviews on this site. Those who give him a star must be Buffy's fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know bullshit when I see it. At every level, this film is terrible. Technically, most of the time you don't know where you are in this movie, even within a scene, skip POV like crazy for no reason. No logic in film terms. Emotionally he is sad for heaven's sake and tries to be a psychological thriller when he is just confused. Throwing ugly red necks in your film is a cheap way to convey "atmosphere". I lost patience with it long before the last act, but I was having too much fun with my friends at riff MST3K to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful films, if even the list of "Scooby Doo" on your resume could count. Gellar is a good actress, but she (or her agent) certainly can't find a vehicle for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I'll send you a few dollars if you promise not to appear in a movie like this again! (Also, Patsy Cline's estate should sue for defamation!)
