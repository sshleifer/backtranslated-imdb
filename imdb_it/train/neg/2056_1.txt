Anyone who loves the two classic novels by Edward Ormondroyd will be disappointed with this film. All the magic and romance have been modernized by his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady, and gave him "three" in return. Three what? Not three wishes, but three laps in 1800 on a rickety elevator ... <br /> <br /> The first novel is Time at the Top. The second is All in Good Time.
