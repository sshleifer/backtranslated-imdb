This film has some good sets and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless father. The film fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too nervous like her daughter and has no equal for Olivia De Havilland, much more nuanced and mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, has fiercely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
