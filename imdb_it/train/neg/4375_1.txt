Less casual and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this film by Kazuo Komizu is worth a visit (at least once). Sleazy snapshotters escort wanna-be actresses / models at a remote house in the woods to sexually harass them. Unfortunately (for horny boys), a long-time demon, who lives in the woods, has already targeted girls for fun. <br /> <br /> The thing ends up having fun with the boys - this is IF consider the beheadings, the dismemberment and the masturbation with the cut limbs "funny". <br /> <br /> Once again, it sounds better on paper than it looks and plays on the film. <br /> <br /> Just like the mutilated Komizu LIVING DEAD TO TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also manipulates this effort and is saved only by a bold violence and some great strokes of white tights. <br /> <br /> Don't buy the hype, though, or you? I will be seriously disappointed.
