This is a great idea for a film but, unfortunately, it doesn't turn out to be a great film. What begins as a sweet and almost stupid romantic comedy on a Fluffer in love with his out-of-control Fluffee spirals in a bizarre combination of genres and a real plot stew, with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA AND LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRISK and also a curious 400-dash "dash" launched towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but, in the end, this well-made and well-produced film adds nothing. However, the actors all do game work with the material and there are some good laughs in the world of gay porn behind the scenes. <br /> <br />
