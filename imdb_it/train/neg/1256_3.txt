This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a family title to bring his "vision" to the screen. He did it with `Batman ',' Sleepy Hollow 'and now this. This is not a remake. The only thing he has in common with the original is that he has simian who can talk (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo). Burton reconstituted the whole story, watering it down for today's mass spectators. <br /> <br /> The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time. During the 1960s, America was struggling to redefine its civilization. It was a turbulent period of soul searching and rethinking social norms. It was the era of civil rights in which groups long considered inferior required to be treated as equals. In that context, the POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turbulence facing the public of the day. POTA was an extremely intelligent film that tackled difficult issues and elegantly kept the oppressions of American society under control by making the white boy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought to be provocative and intelligent with both subtle and obvious ironies. <br /> <br /> Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was from the sixties. This is Apes for Dummies. It is superficial and fast, replacing the politically correct banalities for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than on substance. The "surprise" ending is absolutely incongruous and does not contribute to the film except to a cliffhanger who organizes the sequel. While the final of the original POTA tied everything gracefully into one powerful scene, Burton's ending merely merely mocked the audience, taunting: "I know something you don't know, and you'll have to wait for the sequel to find out. <Br / > <br /> From a technical point of view, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent. The make-up is fantastic and Burton's camcorder is exceptional (although I still don't like his dark look). , thirty-three years of progress in prosthetic make-up cannot compensate for the insulting and vacant script. <br /> <br /> The story has been reduced to a monster movie, humans unite behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) for fight the monstrous monkeys, helped and helped by some turncoats (in particular Helena Bonham Carter as Ari). The presentation is formidable and simplistic with a lot of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality. <br /> <br / > Acting it's mixed. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor who is simply a disbeliever in this role. Walberg is excellent at playing dark and grumpy characters who are tormented but strong. This part requires an inspiring hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far from his ability that the disconnection is ridiculous. He desperately tries to do something with a fragile character, but his interpretation is presented as a cross between a college peacekeeper and a love-sick teenager. <br /> <br /> Then there's Tim Roth. His is a virtuous performance, saving the film from total ruin alone. Roth is diabolically hateful like the malevolent general Thade. Create one of the most wicked and despicable villains I can remember for a long time. Moreover, his physical acting is superlative, making a man-ape so perfect a fusion that one can almost believe that the species exists. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. It's a decent entertainment, as long as you control the brain at the door. I rated it 3/10. From a technical point of view it is much better, maybe a 9/10. However the story is an insult to the original series. It's just another attempt at Burton's self-adulation, using a family title to attract crowds at the box office, so many people can see what a genius he is. Of course it's true, but it would be nice if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of a simple dad thought for mass consumption.
