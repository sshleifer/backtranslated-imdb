This film didn't have big stars in it, but it had a very good cast full of excellent supporting actors AND Gene Tierney before it became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, one would expect more from the film than is actually provided. Most of this, I suspect, is due to a second-level script, given that director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. <br /> <br /> The film is set in East Africa during World War II - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to create problems among the locals. One of the white men in the film is a double merchant, working for the destruction of the British empire! But the adorable Tierney, who plays the daughter of a sultan (!), Is ready to save the day for good old UK. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long sided with the Empire and the 1930s and 1940s saw a plethora of pro-empire films. Nowadays, with changed sensibilities, the notion of seeing happy black natives die for the queen and the country seems ridiculous - and it would be difficult to take root for both sides! Yet in his day, this piece of propaganda was effective in supporting support for the British - although, seen today, the film suffers from a lengthy screenplay and a silly casting. The only bright moment in the film is the final showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad that after such a powerful scene the film only seemed to talk and talk - losing a bit of its fist.
