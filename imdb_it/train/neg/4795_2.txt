It seems that this is the only film that John Saxon has ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop later and to stand in front of the camera. This film is a dog, from beginning to end, and it's boring and made of wood, without there being much. A hero from the Vietnam war accepts a job for a mafia boss, becomes a bit too friendly with his wife and then his wife is killed by the mafia boss and the war hero caught and sent to prison on death row , in particular. Now, this particular prison has experienced inmates and is testing some formulas that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there are all these infected people trapped in the prison, some of which are turning into zombies and the rest that suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. This goes on and on and on with nothing particularly to show or say for itself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to come a couple of times but no, apparently it was just preparing to take off on a different path and equally boring. If one looks to the end it could become a zombie, so don't risk it. 2 out of 10.
