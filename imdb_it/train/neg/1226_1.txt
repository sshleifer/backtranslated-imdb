My God, how the powerful have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she was definitely tough when she played this role. This film is negative for one reason in particular: lapses into logic. It looks like one of those movies that would have been viable with all its holes in the plot if it came out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> The details of the story Della (Kim Basinger) has just arrived from buying gifts at a mall and is harassed by a gang of thugs who end up killing a policeman who came to her aid. From then on she is chased by these idiots idiots through an abandoned road and she frees them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. <br /> <br /> So many things don't go in this movie. As I said, this film leaps at logic at every turn and, with the exception of Kim Basinger, acting is made for bad TV. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is bad for TV. The way he kills each of these politically correct thugs (1 Caucasian, 1 Hispanic, 1 Asian and 1 African American who come together to persecute a Caucasian woman: don't you just love America?) It's ridiculous to make a mistake. The way he killed the Hispanic boy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hooligan was so out-of-bound that it makes your head shake with shame. I recommend it only to lovers of bad movies and nobody else. Anyone else, in particular, Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this movie. Don't you want to see an actress you respect in such a bad movie now? Obviously not. You have been warned.
