This is a really terrible movie. What they did was take a TV show, which was never aimed at young children and gave him treatment with George Lucas (ie he ruined it by joking to appeal to the younger audience). <br /> <br /> OK so the Thunderbirds TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of the shows, it was rather formidable, but it was always pleasant to watch (especially when the models exploded) and the vocal cast wasn't so bad. <br /> <br /> He suffers from bad casting and bad acting (with the notable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope and Ron Cook as Parker, who seem to be the only cast members to have an idea of how their characters should be interpreted) after this disguise I would not have allowed Frakes to direct the traffic. <br /> <br /> The central point of Thunderbirds was that it concerned the whole Tracy family and how they worked as a team, preventing disasters or coming to the rescue of those involved in the disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this garbage like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give him 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
