A propaganda film for the Palestinian "cause". If you were expecting an impartial documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you will have to look elsewhere. If you are an anti-Semite (or simply an anti-Zionist - nothing wrong with supporting the destruction of a country, right?) Or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (for example, mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this is the documentary for you. Should make for a fun evening on college campuses in the UK and the United States. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged by the large number of lies presented in this video. I only hope that those who are truly unaware of the situation are not corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth.
