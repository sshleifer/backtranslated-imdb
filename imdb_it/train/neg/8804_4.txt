Great CGI effects and a truly Oscar-winning performance of Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-trick pony in this film, as he got the Oscar for best actor that year on Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This film is a truculent love letter to the baby boomer generation, with a barely concealed right-wing bias, starting with Forrest's service in Vietnam until the "resolution" with Jenny to end. <br /> <br /> Having said that, though, it's extremely fun and an American film to the end. I found some parts of this film too offensive, Zemeckis silenced this film almost to the level of Gump himself. . Perhaps that was the point he was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself, "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" choices and has been in the "right place at the right time" for the last 45 years. Those who make mistakes according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. So Zemeckis is saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic quality, even an American one?
