There is an excellent reason why Edison went straight to the video: he would have landed in theaters with a crumbled thump. The film lasted too long and was boringly dangerous. Just a notch above Lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are so laughable and the action almost as non-existent as the acting of Justin Timberlake. I hate beating the boy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better. <br /> <br /> The film is not so bad ... just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot to be the protagonist of man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is also almost always fun (you can see him swallow several times while chewing the landscape), and Freeman has the ability to elevate this film to three stars (out of ten ... it's not so nice). <Br /> <br /> On balance, the last mistake of this movie is that it's a trivial and annoying piece of pseudo-action poppycock that can't keep anyone awake. He also can't get anyone to make a mess of any of the characters. All in all, it's simply boring. That being said, rent this when you suffer from insomnia.
