Just a regular Jason Lee movie, there were some parts of the movie that were fun. The undertone of the move is to live life to the limit, I think. These are the types of movies that I think 14-year-old girls look at slumber parties. It was a perfect movie. It's kind of one of those movies you have on the bottom and you watch from time to time when something attracts attention. I think Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and we would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. He's just a kind of guy who meets a movie for girls. This is the perfect movie they would show in the Central comedy. I'm glad I didn't see this movie at the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.
