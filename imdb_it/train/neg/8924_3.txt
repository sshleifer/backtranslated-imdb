It was disappointing to see this DVD after so many years. For me the main problem is the irregular script. <br /> <br /> Although some of them are witty and fashionable, quite a few are boring, not fun and lifeless. Many of the gags simply sit there, free of spark and energy. <br /> <br /> Of the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch get along very well. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (too bad he hasn't made any more films). But for my money, there's only too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed has almost no chance of fighting. His character seems relegated to brush aside on the sidelines, wondering what he is doing in this film. <br /> <br /> The low user rating should give an idea of ​​the public opinion of this piece. Vidal's original provided a lot of potential that was practically wasted. Not even the "classic" movies have done much. All in all a rather minor effort, and it is not likely to become much better with time.
