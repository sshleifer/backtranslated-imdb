It was pointed out in a post deleted by another user of IMDb that anyone could see "The Medusa Touch" should be warned of a scene that strangely recalls the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York. But I hope that everyone who reads this will consider this warning. Despite an interesting pedigree (producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", co-producer Arnon Milchan co-produced the Oscar nomination "LA Confidential" and screenwriter John Briley won an Oscar for "Gandhi") and an international in the cast, I found "The Medusa Touch" as a riot of ambiguous and involuntary laughter. It was a misdirected mess, horribly written and recited. He tried to capitalize on the genre of telekinetic thrillers of the 1970s. The film fails on many fronts. Please consider "Carrie" and underestimated "The Fury" (both directed by Brian DePalma). They were two fun and exciting thrillers that dealt with the same subject.
