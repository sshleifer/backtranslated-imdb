In the seventeenth Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscatels from the King of Spain. While at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold destined to buy weapons and almost takes away the life. Mayeda must fight all odds to survive and protect the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is an epic million dollar adventure set on three continents. <br /> <br /> Interpreted by film legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy ) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The winning team of Osaka stunts purchased for the Bob Ivy screen brings exciting battle / action sequences such as the opening battle against the eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying jewels priceless and the final clash between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. There is also a fine soundtrack by the famous composer John Scott. Director Sho Kusugi has not even been nominated for an Oscar for this film that deals with emotional conflict such as the death of the Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after mourning, all treated very well. Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Note: the film in question is quite the opposite.
