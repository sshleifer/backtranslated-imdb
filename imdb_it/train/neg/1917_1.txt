This film, although not entirely negative, should have been filmed where the real events took place. Grand Island, Nebraska was devastated by no less than seven tornadoes on the night of June 3, 1980. Grand Island is located in the almost flat valley of the Platte River in Hall County. The creators of this film filmed in the covered Ontario hills and moved the whole event into a non-existent city called Blainsworth. The people of Grand Island bravely survived this terrible night only to be forgotten because of a poorly made movie.
