A scientist on an island is deeply saddened by the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So think: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who wouldn't? It is a bit difficult to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that is killing everyone is constantly called "Paul". Furthermore, the cast of William Forsythe as a hero of MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday-kinda lacks credibility. On the other hand there are some hot chicks that actually make you look at the screen while the Paul shark bites another to death. In fact I find bad b-movies pretty funny. But for my taste it would have been a much better film if it had been made to say $ 10000 less. So it could have been fun.
