So you could read some of the comments posted on this movie, and you might think about yourself, "Huh, there were definitely a lot of RAVE REVIEWS published on December 30th." The funny thing is that most of these rave reviews seem to come from the same person or, at best, a small coordinated group of "Open House" groupies. The truth, my friends, is that this film is really unwatchable. Just because he is "independent" doesn't mean he gets a free pass. If you are going to make a musical, both on the film and on stage, both on Broadway and in the local community playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a.) Your actors can sing, (b.) Your actors can dance (c. ) you have a decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well written score and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and fascinating. Even Anthony Rapp can't save this. It is one of those unfortunate cinematic experiences in which I felt really deeply embarrassed for all the people involved.
