I can't believe it, IMDb really has every TV program known to man! I haven't seen this show for over 20 years. I only remember two episodes and I barely remember them. I remember that Tony might not have been active from the beginning, because one of the episodes I remember is one in which everyone tries to convince Tony to join, but he rejects them, but generally at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House, with everyone who applaud. <br /> <br /> The other I remember is the one in which Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead, (complete with funerals and mourners). I don't remember why it sounds dead, or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have imagined it since no one else had ever heard of it.
