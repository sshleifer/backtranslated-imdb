Three writers have made a successful attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel for the tube, yet this TV movie was ultimately injected too much melodrama and simply doesn't know when to stop. The struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by the rich and enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning of the last meeting held there - Ellen's daughter's coming-out party - Tilly decides on her artistic theme, never dreaming that her daughter died mysteriously before the function started, or that she and the deceased presented a surprising similarity between them! Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn that does not tolerate careful scrutiny, one that fails to match the woman in emotional intensity. The role of Burstyn staggers on the field, while Tilly freezes up doing the routine with dreamy eyes. Only a sequence late in the film (the morning after the mural is finished) is accused of honest feelings, anger and betrayal. The rest is piffle.
