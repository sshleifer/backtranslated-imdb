End of the World is a film without incidents, which is strange given that it should relate to the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a kind of scientist, I'm not exactly sure which type. He has two jobs in a government facility (?) Guarded by four security men. His first job is the monitoring of transmissions to and from space (although this actually seems more like a hobby than when he doesn't work at work 2). The second job forces him to wear a protective suit and enter a dark room ... at least that's the best I can imagine. Apparently the "plant" is not exactly top secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. It crashes (they are going to dinner) while discovering a message from space: Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over again. It says something about the fact that it is the first message from space that I have ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they will be late for dinner. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). A few moments later he discovers that China has suffered a serious earthquake. From there, the film goes ... nowhere! Yes, there are Christopher Lee, but that doesn't help much. In addition, Lee offers lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II. This film is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer once you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade science fiction. Furthermore, there is a lot of repertory material from the earth that is being destroyed.
