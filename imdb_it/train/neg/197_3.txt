Despite being a great James Arness western, this film has become the worst Alamo movie ever made. The story was terrible, inaccuracy in all this, and only false falsehoods to start! Continuity was chosen for the four winds. Does anyone capture the cannon sequence? The Mexicans were stupid enough to shoot cannons that obviously still had mud and sticks sticking out of the pipes. Come on! Then there's Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! The customer must have been away or something. Or just out of your mind!
