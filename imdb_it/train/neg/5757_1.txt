The film was watchable while Nicolson was on screen. However, I had to fight against getting bored when the film depended on Meryl Streep to carry on scenes without Jack; it was as sweet as it could be. The relationship between the characters was nothing special; these characters have been portrayed before and much better. It seemed a scenario based on real life in the worst absolute sense: 90% of everyday life is boring and not worth writing or watching. Because Ephron felt that his life and relationship with Carl Bernstein was interesting enough to write about me. Perhaps he wrote it as a therapy - for many writers, putting an episode of their life on paper is cathartic. Well, but then why someone in Hollywood felt that this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me.
