This move reminded me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. It has the same kind of idea that people get what they deserve. I think they are always in a Crypt story. The same goes for bad acting. Bad acting. I liked the movie knowing that most people didn't like it and didn't expect much. Whenever I watch a Stephen King movie I don't expect much because all of his films are horrible compared to the genius of his novels. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love how Carrie played like a real story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and so on. It was so good. But I noticed that both novels were not like movies. The finals were very different from the versions of the film. I assume from those two novels that all his novels have changed considerably and the conclusions are always trivial. The end of Thinner is the worst. So of cheese. I want to read the book to discover the real ending. I suggest to all those who intend to read Stephen Stephen's novels to watch his films in advance so they can be compared. And in this way you will be very satisfied in the book. I intend to do it with all his novels that have been turned into films. I'm sure if they were made into movies they were real books ... and the script went terribly wrong.
