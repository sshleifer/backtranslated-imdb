Spoken like a real tough gangster. The story is no worse than any number of gangster films, but it will never confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league. <br /> <br /> But what makes the film periodically painful to watch are all these Italian Americans who wander around smashing gangsta lines in an even worse accent. Pacino would have been fantastic if only they had nicknamed him. I couldn't wait to see Abrahams and Lodge, but their accents of steenky ruined the fun. <br /> <br /> Ah, well, even the script isn't too hot. Don Corleone would make him disappear five minutes after meeting him, smiling and patting him on the shoulder all the time.
