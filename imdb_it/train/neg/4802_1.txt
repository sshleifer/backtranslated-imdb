I give this wedding at 3 years and this lengthens it. Adrianne Curry has a dirty, spoiled, controlled, noisy mouth, and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. He tells Chris that he has an image to protect and must avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and a different time distortion. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will never have happiness after the end. His mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to regain his youth. Here 2 good people who will end up in a bad divorce. I don't think his old "Brady family" will fit into his new life. I see them turned off. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He supported him and was there for him.
