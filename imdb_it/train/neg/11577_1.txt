The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, writers try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (previous version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as possible (successfully), don't ask for Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment with this nasty stuff. It offers endless and endless dialogues and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a city with beautiful lobby lifts, an art deco style church by Bruce Goff and a charming Frank Lloyd Wright villa. Visit Tulsa, don't watch this movie. It does not do justice to the position.
