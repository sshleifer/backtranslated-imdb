I got a "Bogeyman" DVD and this stunker was an extra feature. I thought it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes an "ass" of "u-" and "me". I had read before seeing that BII contains a lot of footage from the original and that the actress Love was acting. While watching "Return of the Boogeyman", I decided to follow the original movie to see the infamous death-by-toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the film was finished. Rip off. I think I thought it was BII because this one has a title similar to one of the alternative BII titles. Oh well, at least this was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my mistake and start talking about the mistakes of the movie. Many, many, mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli Whatever do you think he is? He really thinks that the same movie will sell in different forms. There is nothing original that holds back Part III. It's basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic, who is giving us a boring game in a cruel way as everything happens. This is the film. Oh, and a death-by-stereo scene, but you can read it from someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is lost forever. <br /> <br /> Final note: this is not a series of films to look backwards.
