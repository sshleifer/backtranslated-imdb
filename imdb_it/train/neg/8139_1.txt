Or maybe that's what it looks like. However, "The Bat People" is as flat as a carpet, as insipid as a sack of flour and as exciting as a rock ... and as clever as all three combinations. <br /> <br /> Ok, plot in a nutshell (suitable vase, which ...): a doctor (Moss) is bitten by a bat while controlling a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and then turns into a bat - well, not exactly a bat but a bat - like a creature that looks more like a werewolf who kills his victims in a first-person perspective ... <br /> <br /> But then there is is the sheriff's business (Pataki), which talks about the sheriff type WORST: the hick type. Claim people, dance to married women, steal handkerchiefs from haberdashery (the FIEND!), Smoke with one of those cigarette holders in your mouth and talk at the same time, making it look and sound like Buford T. Justice in "Smokey and the Bandit "e (this is the worst part) ... IT'S THE WIDEST CHARACTER OF ALL THE FILM! <br /> <br /> The whole film, however, is just a film-of-the-TV crapola similar to a week (guano, in this case). It's an AIP, for crying out loud! What did you expect, Oscar stuff? <br /> <br /> And what else can you say about a movie that not even MST3K can save? <br /> <br /> How about ... without stars for "The Bat People", full version O MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there's a sequel for this movie, I'm burying my TV.
