I rented this movie last week. I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it, so it looked promising. And it was, until Justin Timberlake came on the scene. He is a really bad actor and should never again be allowed to make a film. I mean, he's one of the most boring and uninspired actors I've ever seen. He puts absolutely no emotion in any of his lines. Why the hell was he chosen for the role of Josh Pollack? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment. His character is so boring, it looks like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en. It might seem nice, but believe me, it isn't. <br /> <br /> Now, Dylan McDermott's acting is very good. This is one of the few positive things about this film. It's just inspired. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special. But it has some really interesting lines. <br /> <br /> About the story, although sometimes it was a bit obvious and exaggerated. I was expecting a big break when Lazerov (Dylan McDermott) was killed, but nothing happened.
