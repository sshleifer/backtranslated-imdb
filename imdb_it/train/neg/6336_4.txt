The Bliss theme update is just the latest in a long series of mischievous local comedies that attract the conservative film set. (For the record, this list, all the movies on which a castle miracle seems to be attempting, includes: Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honorable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. Having worked was Crackerjack .) <br /> <br /> Here, performances never get confused, since John Howard doesn't even seem to be in the right movie ?? although perhaps this was the intention, given that Franklin has a sober and conservative sleep towards his most interesting inhabitants. The 20-year-old virgins living with their parents are becoming rarer on the screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the film. In fact, the only reasons could be (1) Howard is bizarre ?? but funny enough ?? performance, and (2) the theme 'suburban nightmare', which spanned Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good / excellent. Enter at your own risk! It can be one for the people who titter at the term 'penis'. 4/10.
