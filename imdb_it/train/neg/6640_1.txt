I find it rather useless to comment on this "film" for the simplest reason why it has nothing to comment on. It is similar to a rotten egg that has nothing beautiful to show to the rest of the world due to the fact that it is rotten like the other infinite the number of eggs has been before it. But since a comment is required for such an insignificant grandeur ... <br /> <br /> Filth is definitely the right word to describe this film created in the same way as any other Romanian "movie" directed by Lucian Pintilie that he insists on representing the so-called "Romanian reality" following the communist era (from 1990 to the present). <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances recommended to people outside Romania as to others (who lately find amateur camera, lack of plot, lack of quality of the director / actors etc., noise etc. like fashionable and even artistic): look and enjoy this "movie" (as I know you will) but other well-intentioned IMDb members prefer, don't write a review online because they make mistakes, irritate and in the end waste their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand this film (among others) has some value, an educational one for it gives the example for: "How NOT to make a film".
