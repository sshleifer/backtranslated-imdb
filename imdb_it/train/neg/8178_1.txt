Have you ever sat down to watch a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have elapsed and suddenly realize that you've seen the movie before? It happened to me with "The Young Graduates". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely misleading. I swear the two women on the cover aren't even in the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was born a decade too late to appreciate the best points of this movie or ... it's just useless garbage. I'm very inclined towards the latter, but I imagine that some out there have developed a connection with this film. <br /> <br /> Hmm ... texture. A plot. Let's see ... there must be a plot here somewhere. No, I can't find it. These are some high school seniors who act on drugs and use drugs and speak in a language that has become obsolete decades ago. One of the students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (who actually refers to an iceberg), so she is receptive to the girl's advances. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of guidance and inanimate dialogues and lots of spastic dances. Our cat, BooBoo, was stabbed by high school dance boys. He watched with incredible intensity as the dancers turned and shook the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
