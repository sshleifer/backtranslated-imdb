a very nice plot, beautiful emotion ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well done and a good story destroyed in the last seconds ... sorry to say but a vote in 1 ... this is what it deserves, I would think that Chris Shadley could come to a better conclusion ... but maybe next time: ) all this meaningless blood for nothing? the end would bring the story to a 10, but it didn't ... at the end it destroyed the whole story, I think that most people are not lame and when they go to make a film your wish is a good end , even if it's complicated ... but the only lame here is the end ... I'm sorry
