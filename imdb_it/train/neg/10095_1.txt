Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There is a high probability that they need immediate professional help, since anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if it is possible not to assign any star is literally scary. <br /> <br /> This film is ... well ... I guess it's practically a kind of attempt in a horrible porn movie / snuff without porn or without horrible pieces (apart from acting, plot, history , sets, dialogues and sound). I mistakenly assumed that it was zombies. <br /> <br /> Looking at reality is pretty scary to be fair; you are terrified that someone will come and you will never be able to describe what it is and they will leave thinking that you are a monster who watches homemade torture videos made at home or something. <br /> <br /> I'm so taken aback I'm writing this review on my phone so I don't forget to try to lower the rating beyond the current 1.6 to save others from the same horrible fate that I just suffered. <br /> <br /> The worst film I've ever seen and what can I say (with my hand on my heart) will never, ever be overcome.
