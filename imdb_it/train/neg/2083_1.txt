At what point does a good movie go wrong? When does a movie go from "watchable" to "where is & ^ @ _ + #! * OFF"? Thank goodness for DVDs like this that can be borrowed from the library - for free! Likewise, thank goodness for the "fast forward" switch on the DVD player. I'm sorry for those people who were tricked at the box office. <br /> <br /> At some point (I forgot exactly when why it's all just a blur now), our "hero", Luke Wilson starts running through the traffic; I think he was looking for a taxi. It was then that I gave up, realizing that I didn't care if he found his ride or was hit by a garbage truck. <br /> <br /> The last time the film was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbed out of the dumpster, hairdryer in hand, and first met the "heroine", Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the criminal dangling kidnapper hanging helplessly from the fire escape, far above the departure of Luke and Uma. That was the last time the movie was fun, and when was that scene? Ten minutes into the movie? <br /> <br /> Whenever the film tried to become "funny", it couldn't. Every time the film approached "excitement", it went out, going in the opposite direction. When a musical score could have helped to squeeze the life out of this fool, the soundtrack remained empty and silent. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were unnecessary and went beyond lame; damage to unnecessary and childish sets and props. When Uma turns into the crazy ex-girl, I felt like I was watching "The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction"; at that moment I realized that we couldn't go back because I didn't like "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Pulp Fiction." <br /> <br /> The companion of Luke Wilson, Rainn Wilson (also seen in the grim "The Last" Mimzy ") does not add another insult to the wound in this terrible film. Rainn Wilson, the king of television Noia, should being with that equally horrible means. "Hey, Rainn Wilson! Leave the full-length videos alone! Every time Uma's rival, Anna Faris, came on the screen, I expected Jason or Freddy or a scary monster to jump from behind the view: once you see Anna Faris in "Scary Movie", that's all you see, the movie doesn't matter, no matter the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just awful and was so out of place in this movie.
