I give this film UNO, because it's really a terrible movie. The soundtrack of the DVD is so bad, it really hurts my ear. But the vision, however disconnected, shows something truly extravagant in Italian society. I won't go into details how shocking it was, but the various incidents are absolutely abnormal. So, for the value of kink, I give one. In other words, video, photography, acting of adult actors / actresses are simply poor, a real athlete for people who love foreign films. Roberto, the main character, has a full range of emotions but exaggerated to the point of being incredible. However, the children in the film are mostly 3/4 years old, and they are genuine and the film gives a glimpse of Italian life ..
