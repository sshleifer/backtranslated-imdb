The plot of this film is not strong at all, there are many holes. If you approach it like a car movie it's not bad, there are a lot of great cars in this. The reason I like it is because I come from the area where it was shot. I get the most fun looking at the recognizable places of St. Cloud MN and seeing how the city has changed since 1989. It is an interesting historical piece for us locals. It seems that every time a film is made here everyone wants a relationship. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores because they were all stolen once they were released on VHS. I had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay, I find it interesting how the resistance race takes place all over the city. I didn't know the director was from St. Cloud.
