Interesting idea and plot that did not work. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie, maybe you'll feel dissatisfied with the ending like I did. I didn't really know who to cheer for the film, Taye Diggs seemed bored like the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been more than a good girl, we could actually enjoy seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator to justice. The problem was that she was a bitch like the other girls, going from sweet girl to opportunist compatriot. I can't understand the moral message of this film and, as a detective story and thriller, it doesn't work.
