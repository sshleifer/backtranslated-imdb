First of all, let me say that this is not the film for people trying to watch something lively and joyful for the holidays. This film is cold, brutal and simply depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a plump mother who is at Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their home, they cannot buy Christmas gifts for children, etc. You have the idea, happy holiday stuff. This is how Harry Dean Stanton comes in as Gideon the Christmas angel, who with his dark hat and long coat comes off more like a pedophile wandering around the children all day watching them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill her family and then offer to bring them back if she still believes in Christmas. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a refuge for the fleeing Nazi refugees. The film puts it all so often that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the film is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this film wanted to be something like Capra, but it left out the joy and feeling of what a vacation movie should be.
