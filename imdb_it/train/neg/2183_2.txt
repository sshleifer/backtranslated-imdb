This film was really bad whether we consider it a science fiction film, a horror movie or even a comedy. The whole thing is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The film seems (and is) very cheap, the actors have no idea what the acting is and the script clearly shows that it was made together with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was not at all scary - it was even pretty - and they thought they needed something more impressive; they failed here too (the trick is horrible even in the late 1950s, quite funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer has never materialized; he was really bad in both. The same applies to the actors, who guide and support. <br /> <br /> "The brain that would not die" is the best result of its short duration.
