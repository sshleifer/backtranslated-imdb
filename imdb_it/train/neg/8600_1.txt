In all the history of the reduced budget. this film must be one of the worst. It is true that there are some fun parts of the film, but in general it was just awful. I just can't figure out which person can't handle a group of snails. I mean they must be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part that is worth in this film is the close-up of a snail trying to bite a man's finger. This was pretty fun.
