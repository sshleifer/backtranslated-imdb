Where to start? How about an incorrect synopsis: <br /> <br /> "X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's violently romantic and violent past, his complex relationship with Victor Creed and Weapon's ominous X program . " <Br /> <br /> His epically violent past turns out to be exceptionally non-violent. <br /> <br /> His relationship with Creed is so superficial that it is difficult to understand how they have any connection. We are thrown from a point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run, in a montage of war scenes in which they fought throughout their long life, and finally in the present where they are part of a hardcore government group of assassins. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in showing their relationship as brothers. Nothing complex is provided for us to believe it is authentic or even loving. <br /> <br /> The romantic element of the film between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and brusque. We are catapulted into a love story so fast that it is over before you can blink. Having just introduced the character, Silverfox is killed after about fifteen minutes. We wonder why we should worry about this. Who was she anyway? <br /> <br /> For a key element of this story of weak revenge, the love story is surprisingly unexplored. He was hurried simply because it was necessary. <br /> <br /> Strangely, when Wolverine discovers that his love is dead, he leaves her in the woods to rot while he goes to find Sabertooth. Being romantic to him has been out of character for him, yet it is necessary to serve the plot in bringing out a very predictable surprise. <br /> <br /> As for the X weapon program, let's just say that after the painful paralyzing Wolverine procedure is up and running. Eventually he arrives at a conveniently old but extremely affectionate couple's home. Surprisingly, Ma and Pa Kent are not alarmed when they find a sweaty naked man in their stable. Is it any wonder the destiny that awaits them? <br /> <br /> In previous films and comics, the main reason Wolverines' amnesia tormented him depended in part on the fact that he was said to have been evil and wicked coldblooded. <br /> <br /> Knowing that this was the case ... did you really want to remember those horrors or keep them hidden and continue your current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world along with your teammates? <br /> <br /> As mentioned in X2: X-men United when Stryker sells some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he knew about the evil deeds they committed together. This film creates the team quite well, only they don't really do much. No disturbing violence, no merciless action, simply harassing some natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on the screen. <br /> <br /> It seems that Wolverine was not at all an evil man under Stryker. Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on Brother Sabertooth who was consequently the violent agent we all thought was Wolverine. In the end he leaves everything together. <br /> <br /> No conflict of dualism here. <br /> <br /> Proper removal of that conflict of characters of good and evil DAMAGED the story immensely. They might even have given him rubber claws. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy, including the introduction of one of the weaker Deus Ex Machinas for ever hitting a script. <br /> <br /> Magic projectiles that erase the memory. <br /> <br /> Really? <br /> <br /> Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine. Yet this was apparently forgotten when an agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that surely wouldn't work on him at all. <br /> <br /> Another problem with this film is that it has tried to focus on Wolverine as it throws in a ton of other mutants that have done little or nothing. Interesting characters were simple changing rooms and did nothing for the story. Most were in the film for a maximum of 5-10 minutes, yet you find yourself wishing to see more and less of Wolverine. <br /> <br /> Fred Dukes (the Blob but not the comic version) can throw a punch tank missile with little or no physical damage to him, but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to stun him? <br /> <br /> Cyclops optics bundles (which instead of being concussive force are now more laser-like) can burn through buildings but when fired directly at Sabertooth it simply hits the ground without even damaging its clothes. Adamantium trench anyone? <br /> <br /> The mutite (gravity defying) Mutit, instead of using its signature cards, is transformed into a sort of crazy acrobat. In a badly modified scene he is knocked out by Wolverine ... then surprisingly a few minutes later he is on a roof with VERSO Wolverine. As he regained consciousness, he escaped a few blocks, climbed a building, then returned to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratch meeting is a mystery yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Some have excused this weakness film claiming it was made from a comic book and therefore should be weak on the character and heavy on flash. The idea that this film is a comic film is fragile and superficial because of this is incorrect. <br /> <br /> The source material of the comics, the true origin of Wolverine ... is a story worth bringing to the screen. Sugar does not cover its past nor does it treat the reader as brainless CGI junkies. It is a well-constructed story and although rethought and adapted over time, it began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith. A much more intense and exciting story. <br /> <br /> This FOX movie should be seriously forgotten. <br /> <br /> Anyone with that magic gun? <br /> <br /> 4/10
