I'm rather a fan of novelist / screenwriter Michael Chabon. His novel "Wonder Boys" has become a fantastic film by Curtis Hanson. His masterful novel "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay" won the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, and he had a hand in the screenplay for "Spider Man 2", probably the greatest comic film of all time. <br /> <br /> Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has also directed some wonderful comic operas, such as "Dodgeball", a series of short films "Terry Tate: Office Linebacker". And with a cast including Peter Saarsgard, Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte and Mena Suvari, this seems like child's play. <br /> <br /> It is. Literally. <br /> <br /> Jon Foster plays Art Bechstein, the son of a gangster (Nolte) who recently graduated in Economics. Jon is in a state of arrested development: he works at a minimum wage at the Book Barn, has an insipid relationship with his girlfriend / boss, Phlox (Suvari), which amounts to little more than a copious amount of sex, no different plans a career for which he has no passion. <br /> <br /> One night at a party, a former roommate introduces Jon to Jane (Miller), a beautiful and intelligent violinist. Later that evening they go out for the cake and she asks Jon a question that starts to shake him from his catatonic state of existence: "I want you to tell me something you never told a single soul. Make this night indelible." Jon he then tells her a recurring dream in which he wanders around the city looking at the faces of strangers who overtake him, yet none of them looks into his eyes. "I guess it must be how death feels," he says. <br /> <br /> The next day, Jane's wild boy, Cleveland (Saarsgard), kidnaps Jon from work and takes him to a massive abandoned sawmill, and soon Jon, Cleveland and Jane are passing every waking moment together to go to punk rock concerts, take drugs and drink lots of alcohol. This does not go well with Phlox, which leads Jon to have a more personal relationship, namely to make her meet his new friends and his father. The film then tries to take us on Jon's journey as he shakes off his father's chains, Phlox and his endless work as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with Cleveland and Jane. <br /> <br /> There is a problem with following Jon throughout the movie: he is completely uninterested. It has no ambitions, passions or goals. He walks through life like the invisible specter he described to Jane the night they met. In the beginning this is not a problem. But it never becomes more interesting. He is a completely passive character. He simply follows the bohemian Cleveland and Jane, but he never gives us a single idea of ​​what he cares about or wants to do with himself. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film and its supporting characters have nothing to do and do little else than celebrate, have sex and fight. In other words, a lot of noise for nothing. What we have here is the surface skin of a good movie with nothing inside. An overwhelming cinematography, a ponderous voiceover with characters staring into the distance, many sex scenes both straight and gay, big topics, more angry sex, chase scene and a tragic death ... but it doesn't seem to matter. Ironically, at one point, Jane, confused by a number of Jon's aimless actions, asks him, "What's going on, Jon, what is it?" Yes, Jon, say it. We too, in the audience, are dying to know. <br /> <br /> The title "The Mysteries of Pittsburgh" must refer to the characters themselves, because that is what they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional supports for real people. The film never lets us in. We never know what makes any of them beat. We see them doing many things, but we don't know why. And the absence of "why" is one of the worst things a movie can have.
