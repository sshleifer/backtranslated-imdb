This was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wood makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turning in Four Weddings, just as terrible. Another film that portrays England as full of chocolate-boxed cottages and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart maybe Hogwarts looks like? The twee police station looked like the Heartbeat set (a sickening British series set in the 1960s). This film just couldn't think of what it wanted to be - a comedy or a serious examination of undercurrents in women's friendships. Had he remained faithful to the first, the sex scenes of the cemeteries and the stupid assault of marriage could have worked (I only say). But those scenes did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate will talk to Molly again after her terrible behavior. One last note: what is a decent actress like Staunton in this pile of poop? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should stick to wrinkle cream advertising.
