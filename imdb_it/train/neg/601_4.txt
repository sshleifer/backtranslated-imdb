!!!!! OF COURSE THERE ARE SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screenwriting workshop to avoid clichés in horror movies: female protagonist - Controlling the bad things happen to addicts - Checking Heorine puts out bad - Check that Heroine doesn't notice the rascal who recovers it state of unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so as to see the criminal recovered behind the heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems that someone has sent this list of clichés to a film studio instead of using it for lessons. Dear, dear, if only London transport was as regular as the clichés that arise here. In fact there are so many clichés and I've seen it all before moments that no one actually thought of going into details about what the insinuated creep is or how long it has killed people underground. I am led to believe that it is the result of some human experiment and perhaps it was not until that evening that he decided to take revenge on humanity, but all this is so vague as to be meaningless. Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they would make a film that would have swept the Oscars that year and there is always a market for horror movies. Likewise, I doubt it cost too much production and had an eye on the DVD market rather than on film distribution and will say that it is slightly better than the 1972 DEATH LINE, which also included a cannibal killer hidden in the London Underground. it's just that when you think that all the clichés have been used in this movie comes another cliché to lift its ugly head
