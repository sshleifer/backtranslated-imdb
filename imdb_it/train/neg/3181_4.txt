This movie was not created by Chi fan. Most of the great moments that fans eagerly await in the half-hour Tommy medley are simply missed or flown over: at Christmas, they didn't show Daltry's screams after the joke "Tommy doesn't know what day it is ..", they have shown almost * no * Townsend guitar shots in the Pinball Wizard, there were excess crowd shots during the best moments of Go to the Mirror and, worst of all, in the second part of We're Not Gonna Take It (Listening to te), they robbed us of almost all the guitar chords by Pete. Huge pieces of the film are shot from behind the group. It is a very frustrating film to watch and does not deliver the goods. I don't know if director Murry Lerner isn't a fan of Who, or worse, at least for him, if * he is * a fan of Who and that's all that the * eight * cameras could provide for him. To his credit, there are some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, which are very well shot, and sometimes the editing is brilliant. This could be enough to make some viewers happy, as long as you're not anticipating Tommy. The overall sound was mediocre in the broadcast I saw from DirecTV; could be different on video or DVD.
