I can't imagine anyone in a million years would want to see this movie. Not because it was one of the worst ever made (it wasn't), but largely because it is about 20 years old and so out of the mainstream. I was trying to find out where I saw an actor before and it turned up. So, yes, a child stops playing in small league because he doesn't like nuclear weapons, this drives media attention and a quick resolution to the cold war. The end. A fantasy, of course, but someone so furious would have made John Lennon blush. Since terrorism has replaced communism as the ism that scares us to death, this film has really no relevance, except as an (unnatural) look in those days. Similarly, the script, acting and cinema are underdeveloped. The reason why I evaluated it was because I watched this movie about 50 times while I was 5-6 years old and I still have some space in my heart for this, but now I realize that it's not quite cut mustard. So, if the law of large numbers is true and someone eventually decides to take a look at this film, realize that there are better ways to spend your time, but even worse. (For now I will abstain from a tirade by John Q.)
