A train thief imprisoned near Yuma breaks his chain and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden supply of gold that remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). The attempt to bring the Western genre in step with the violence and brutality of the 70s is not even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns released in the late 1960s. It is incredibly simple and square, with female characters who merely act as punch-bags and possible victims of rape. While the former sheriff is back in command, Charlton Heston offers one of his laziest and least inspired performances ever (he has a good time, trying to read a letter and fiddling with glasses). James Coburn, as a half-crazy half-breed, is practically also an autopilot, but Coburn has a way to transform even the worst dialogues and situations into something pungent and unnerving. It's his show all the way. * 1/2 from ****
