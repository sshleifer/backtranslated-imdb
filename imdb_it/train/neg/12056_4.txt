This film is a good example of how, through media manipulation, it is possible to sell a film that is nothing but a very unpleasant television sitcom. In Puerto Rico, the newspaper with the most widespread circulation has continually written about the wonders of this film, almost silencing all the others. Coincidentally, the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island to have analyzed the form and content of the film and highlighted all its defects, clich√©s and bad writing. <br /> <br /> Just because a film is part of the audience you laugh with easy and obvious jokes, and since one can recognize actors and sets, it doesn't make it an acceptable film.
