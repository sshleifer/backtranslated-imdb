Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska and a bit of modern psycho billy, then seeing live performances is the only thing worth watching. This film has tons and tons of cameos, along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-important role, and many death scenes. Looks like it might be good, right? Well, the dead keep coming, and repeatedly to many different Warp Tour bands and fans of the event. Some of the deaths begin with style, but then they are recycled over and over again, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies because of a broken head or intestine that is pulled from the stomach. The blood appears as if it were from "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence" by Andreas Schnaas; with this being the "water of the diluted type", but now that film is actually decent and provides humor, something that this film lacks terribly. Of course, the film is produced by Doug Sakmann of Troma, has great potential for low budget, and evidence ... but it's too difficult. Everything is too thought to be fun in this movie, and that's what lowers it. Everything tries to be too comic and foolish, using an intentional bad deed, excessive use of useless deaths and doing the same thing ... again and again. Basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board", or any movie you made with your friends: it's fun for those who did, and that's all. <br /> <br /> potential, good idea, great use of effects - but it's the same thing ... again and again: a band plays, a band dies, the fans die. Everyone dies, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is for these types of films - which is basically "bad slap" - do they try too hard or don't do it at all?
