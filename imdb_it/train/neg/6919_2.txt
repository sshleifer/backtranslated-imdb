My roommates and I almost ran out of TV with the many spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious pseudo-zen dreck from the 70s. I read about this campfest for years and scanned my local TV listings late at night for YEARS in search of this elusive asshole. Several years ago our local ABC subsidiary was known for showing some fantastic films for its weekend movie ("Rane", "The Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then one day it happened: at 1:40 on Saturday night (over 5 years ago) here it is! We had more than 15 people and the film did NOT disappoint! <br /> <br /> See! Andy Griffith has been the meanest and most threatening villain ever since he was in "Stargate"! <br /> <br /> Look! William Shatner sports a variety of things on top of his head that look only vaguely like human hair (or anything organic for that matter). <br /> <br /> Hear! the incredibly foolish jaw from the 70s that makes "Chicken Soup For The Soul" as BF Skinner <br /> <br /> Feel! Content that every decade was better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those who are still reading ... the plot surrounds a group of middle-level mid-level a-hole who decide to suck their s --- boss head (Griffith) by joining him in a cross-dessert race through California and Mexico. Everyone wears leather jackets, looking more at Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a Cellar, get drunk, smoke their joints (the view Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smokes a cane is an image I will not soon forget), start a fight, try a rape and act like a group of suburban middle class jacks. Even though I have an excellent copy that I recorded on TV, I WANT that this will be published on video so that the whole world can enjoy its half silly.
