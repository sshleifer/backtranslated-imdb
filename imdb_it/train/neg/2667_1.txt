Kalifornia is disturbing. I believe there is no reason to tell this story. It is neither fun nor has social value. Technically, the film is very well done, the performances are first class and first class. The story develops in an intriguing and interesting way. But in the end this film gets sick and is aberrant for decency. I recommend Kalifornia to anyone.
