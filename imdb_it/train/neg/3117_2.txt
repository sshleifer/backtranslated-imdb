My husband is a big fan of Robin Williams. I like him too, but I generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on the comic roles. My thoughts have been confirmed with this film. I was completely bored during the whole movie. The story was predictable. I realize that it was inspired by a true story. But, my hypothesis is that there may have been some suspense or intrigue while maintaining the truth in the story. None of the characters was well developed. There was a secondary story about the main character and his companion. This relationship may have been explored further. More important, however, would have been a deeper exploration of the "boy's" mother. His psychological profile would have been interesting to look into. Obviously it has a long history that has not been touched except in the most superficial way. If my husband wasn't a big Williams fan, we would have 20 minutes. Too bad I can't recover $ 20 or 2 hours.
