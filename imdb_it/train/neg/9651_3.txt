The film is total crap. We have two good actors who are a mixture and a head of meat from an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is crap. The badly sketched characters. Tale of non-existent stories. No changes to talk about. Ajay Devgan as Rock Star ... is a dream in itself. The film draws to the point of decline. The whole charade of Arjun who brings his Manna to London, let his girlfriend pack up and not play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dubbing process) is absurd. Salman Khan is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some good films from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all good directors are at the mercy of the Box Office craze ... that Mumbai Media Morons have created. This is yet another shit movie in the "Wanted" lines with an idiotic actor like Salman Khan who has no place in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is as good with Indian cinema as the Titanic was for the winter cruise business. On a positive note: I like the character of Asin who dances Bharatnatyam when she turns into a western-style dance when the teacher doesn't watch.
