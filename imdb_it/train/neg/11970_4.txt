... for the LT to have chosen this. First of all, the film was not horrible, it was just Hollywood. The worst case scenario I-need-this-to-happen-or-we-have-no-movie: if Willis's mission was to save the doctor, but it was adamant that his "people" let him out of the missionary, he he would put her on that first helicopter and drive those refugees to the border without her. He would not compromise his refugee package. This is not how it works. But, as I pointed out, this is Hollywood, we must have a drama. This is why we create films, because reality is not so complicated. However, I thought that Willis and the good doctor had functional chemistry. That being said, there are also some well done battle scenes in the film. "It's not a waste of time", "Tears of the Sun" is worth the DVD rental fee. Take a look on a rainy day and you will be satisfied.
