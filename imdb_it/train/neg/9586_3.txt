After the disastrous Revolution, this film was practically the last nail in the coffin of Goldcrest and, therefore, of the British Film Industry. The film is absolute pants, it is full of music from the revival jazz attempt of the mid-80s and based on a book and an author who was briefly popular at the time and who rightly lost the darkness. Temple searched for years trying to find Suzette and invented 8th Wonders Patsy Kensett another person who had been popular for a while at the time. By the time the film came out of post production, the Jazz revival was over, as was Kensett's career and the film met an absolutely indifferent film audience. <br /> <br /> Mediocre would be an exaggeration for some of the worst / campest / Cheesiest acting forever beautify the British silver screen by watching almost 20 years and the film is really cringeworthy.
