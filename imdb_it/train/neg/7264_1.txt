Just another film that exploits free frontal male nudity; horrible acting, besides, the love scenes are the most non-sexy I've ever seen (and it's not about me that don't connect the idea of ​​two young people making love, since I'm gay). <br /> <br /> Again, as in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough arguments for a short film of about five minutes, but manages to make a 2-hour movie with it ... And this time, there is not even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community to talk about! Merciful God, have mercy on us!
