Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. This is the first, the most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to re-imagine Scooby-Doo and company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is squeaky and it never sounds like one of the previous incarnations of Scooby's shows. They also changed the outfit and the classic way of walking from the original. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what's up with the villain's corner yet, but he's definitely not following the formula used in any of Scooby's previous shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the strange animation used for other WB shows has grown on me; this too could be. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at - once - if you can handle the lack of the correct Shaggy voice. This is enough to shake one up to enjoy the show properly. Also, I'm trying not to be an inflexible or fussy fan. Evolve or die, as the saying goes. We'll see how they go after another two episodes - at that point I will have formed a much more solid opinion.
