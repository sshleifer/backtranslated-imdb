As many others have stated, this is a terrible film, from every aspect of filmmaking. The way they have ever had a certain name famous actors to deal with this project is amazing. <br /> <br /> Many people have complained that they were shot on "cheap" video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not in the "economic" video. What made everything negative was the lighting, the white balance, the shooting technique and the editing. <br /> <br /> So many shooting and editing techniques have been used that have been a production mess. Rough and incoherent lighting, excessive use of free-hand shooting (Woody Allen wing), erratic editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done, without a real purpose. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the kitchen of the restaurant the scenes are embarrassing; very amateur. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level. <br /> <br /> The way this video has ever produced print is beyond me. It is worth looking at if only to be amazed at how ugly it is.
