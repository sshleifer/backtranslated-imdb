This film was a waste of time, even for rent on DVD. If the super-fast camera shots get faster than that, we could even pay twenty dollars to get into the laundromat, get popcorn and watch the dryer spin. Jet Li is much better than this. One can only hope that he will not soon be doing business to make another film based on the click like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is a film to be avoided, this is "The One".
