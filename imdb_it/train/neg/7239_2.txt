This film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy. It is neither intelligent nor romantic and is certainly not an effective comedy. The fortunes of the well-meaning but pathetic character, "Tom", oscillate from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another. The only saving thanks are the competent performance of Toni Collete and the frequency with which we see the pleasant face of Paltrow. Overall, to avoid!
