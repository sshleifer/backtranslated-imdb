I read reviews on this film and decided to try it. After all, I am an open-minded man and have given good reviews to some very good films. As the credits turned to this, I looked for meaning and something nice to say. Here it is: "This film was mercifully short". This is all I have. <br /> <br /> Ok, ok. The sets and images were well done and the music contributed to giving the atmosphere of the kindergarten life, but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away the beautiful pieces. I found myself laughing at this movie but the way you laugh at your best friend who has just embarrassed himself in front of a big crowd. <br /> <br /> At the time of the "chicken dance" in the finale I had just decided to roll up and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I don't know what this movie could have saved. The acting was not bad and seemed to have a budget, but there was really no way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful naked breasts. Maybe I should have started a doobie or drunk a lot of beer to get the full movie experience. Anyway, I won't watch this movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can say to myself "At least I wasn't in 'Dr. Tarr's Dungeon of Torture:" I'm better than those guys. "
