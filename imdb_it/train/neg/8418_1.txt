Yes, there are great shows here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a film that doesn't seem to have the slightest idea what it's doing. During the first 45-60 minutes of this all the music takes place as a realistic performance. Suddenly, at about an hour, the characters who, until that moment, had always spoken to each other, suddenly start singing each other. To further confuse things, a little further on, from nothing, they actually do about 15 minutes of sung dialogue, then seem to abandon that idea and move on to other things, like a number that starts in a jazz club with drummer and two electric guitars suddenly become a completely orchestrated piece with an invisible string section. In addition to all this inconsistency in the way music is used, the clear inability of composers to actually write music in the style that is supposed to be portrayed. While the first couple of pieces mimic the Motown sound of the 1950s, the rest of the film is just a (bad) Broadway show. Then there is the pure nonsense of the fragments of a group that makes a bad imitation of the Jackson family and Eddie Murphy turns from Little Richard to James Brown to Lionel Richie. When I started channeling Stevie Wonder I couldn't help but laugh. This was clearly one of those films that makes me appreciate how little time I have on earth and resented having wasted two hours watching this movie.
