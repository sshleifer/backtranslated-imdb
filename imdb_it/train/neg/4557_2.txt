OK, it's very rare for me to complain about something I received for FREE. So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and I was very disappointed. The question of a member of the public to the director about the use of Native American references as "bookends" instead of being intertwined in the film, basically says all that this film is FAILED. <br /> <br /> NATIVE American REFERENCES --- Native American references seemed really out of place and invented. It is obvious that this director and writer have tried to face an arena in which they have never played before. They should have adhered to the old adage of "writing about something you know". If they are actually poured into this, it certainly was not shown in the film or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clichés and ON THE NOSE --- I agreed to watch this film based on the fact that it was an indie. So I kept him at higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and she saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out on a wide release, I was already delirious about how successful it would be. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about "Deadline". "Sunshine" led us to click on incidents, but the directors were so clever in their approach that the result would take us in a different direction avoiding the trap of being a "cliché". This film, on the other hand, has had no way of not falling into the trap because it was already TRAPPATO from the beginning. The antics of the psycho-mother, the couple of Hendrix, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and worst movie I've seen this year was both indie. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the directors for having such a good result from their family members at the cemetery.
