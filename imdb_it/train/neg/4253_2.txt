This must be one of the worst vampires ever made by men. How can you transform such a fascinating subject into a totally uninteresting story? Apparently it's not such a difficult task ... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of a vampire movie is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, to which all these things are missing .. Too much light - the spots ! oh my god, why in the name of Christ / Judas was this? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came out he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: only weak) There was only one scene that was almost worth the vision, near the end of the film (beautiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really liked the first one, Judas's twist was definitely original, but this is not good, not in any way. We hope that the third one can caress the vampire signature that I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
