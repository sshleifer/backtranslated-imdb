I don't often do everything to write comments, but for this I had to, just to warn anyone who might think that watching this they will see a comedy. This does not come close. While the premise (color change / genre / whatever) is bad enough (and was done, better, many other times), the actual transformation of two black boys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen. It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to the white chicks. However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women. As you may have guessed by now, they completely fail. I have seen that drag queens without makeup make women more convincing than these two do with the best special effects and tricks that Hollywood can provide. It's scary. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, a terrible dialogue and more holes in the course of a golf course and this film hits a new personal minimum. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
