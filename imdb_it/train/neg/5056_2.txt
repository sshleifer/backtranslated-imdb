*** SPOILERS *** Let's start with the "good" of this film: the acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is horrible (this is not helped by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain, Buntao, head of an Asian criminal union (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing out loud while expressing his "fury" for losing a lot of money; horrible performance. Patrick Muldoon is not much better, and his line of "is a hostile coup" (this is the rest of the title of this film) has been delivered as badly as could be done. There are no other main characters, but no other actor / actress stood out in this film. Then we come to the plot. This should tell you everything you need to know: in the original "Rage and Honor", Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the city center. Now, you are an C.I.A. agent (or was it another government agency - sorry, but this movie was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm ... I can imagine what C.I.A. the application process was like an interviewer: what work experience of the past do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you are hired! I only give him a "2" because of a decent acting and a nice twist at the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon), the bad secret, will be captured).
