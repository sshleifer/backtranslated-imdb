I report it as a "spoiler" only because of some of my comments on the contents of the show, not on the content itself. <br /> <br /> As I read the comments it is clear that those Republicans somehow tolerate the show but disdain it, while the Democrats seem to savor in its so-called veracity. A reader even (it seems) actually indicates that he believes these events happened or could have happened when Bush attended elementary school. <br /> <br /> But as for the content as I see it, trying to be neutral, is that the group that made this series must really be really Bush's hate. In the last episode I saw, s02e03, it emerged that the program must have been put together long before McCain became the front runner for the nomination; because, the other previous riders are all present. Another thing that caught my attention was the use of additional cabinets. I thought the series must have been made in Europe, certainly not in the United States, because I don't know anyone in the United States who doesn't have built-in closets, and most likely in artists' homes. <br /> <While I watch the show, yes, I find myself involved, I am amazed to see what the writers' great desire to do what they can to embarrass our President should be. Of course, there are problems, as many Americans will agree, but it is not a reason to be so hateful in public exhibitions seen all over the world. Perhaps the trend was established by this show and by the network, so that IF Obama or Hillary entered, would they continue to produce and transmit the same kind of "humor" about them? <br /> <br /> Just another comment on a commentator's remarks. If there had been some sort of change in the election in 2000, according to the writer, he was so sure that there would be a completely different and acceptable president. Wow, wishful thinking on your part. As for the events of 911, I think it was set in motion when Clinton was president, and I can't understand how if Gore was president, anything would be very different.
