I despise horror movies, it's no secret. No plot, bad acting and gallons of blood are fixed points of these cinema errors, and this "film" is no exception. I can't believe some cable stations actually run this garbage. (This particular refusal was published directly on the video, as a souvenir). As if to say that any other film would be a great insult to that other film, I say it: all Phantasm movies, all of Jason's films, Freddy's films, Chucky's films and most of Michael Myers' films sum up in one word: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Rating (Phantasm III): 0.5 / 10
