"Darkness" was somehow funny, but never seemed to have a storyline, which lacked one more than other films that were blamed for this damage; For example "Bad Taste". It started really well, with a man running from something. It was very disturbing for these first few minutes, but after a while the film became fun at the gore level, which was hard to understand in some places due to poor lighting and a horrible recording quality. The film was hard to believe because of the youthful acting, which for most of the time seemed to have been like a friend talking to a video camera, doing the line ups as they went. This, with the lack of any plot, made it appear that the film started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. As mentioned before, the gore was the only starting point of this film, which for the most part was difficult to understand.
