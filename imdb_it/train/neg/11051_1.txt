A terrible film containing a group of Canadian D-list actors who seem so embarrassed that they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> This film is poorly written, badly edited and misdirected. He is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre, but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but he is the only one in this film to do it - he really has a bad story and a script to work with. It's not even enough camp to be fun. <br /> <br /> I still have to see Van Pelleske acting in a credible way, and even the subtitles like Eisen (with his nasal and plaintive voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge from Africa. <br /> <br /> Has the director not seen that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien dress? The quarrel between the blue lightning and the orange waves of Pelleske of "magic" (!?! For lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, without a choreographer, superimposed on completely derived special effects. Was there also a director on the set or in the editing room for this catastrophic film (not the good kind)? <br /> <br /> Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't waste your time with this, you'll regret it like I did. I have nothing else to say about this celluloid waste.
