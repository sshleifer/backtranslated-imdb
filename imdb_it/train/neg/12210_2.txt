This film is a joke and must be one of the worst films ever made by Stallone. This is a typical movie from the 80s in which a man destroyed the entire army alone. "First Blood Pt. 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation shown as bad. This film is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the culmination of the Cold War, but I'm sick of having Communists or Nazis who are always shown as enemies. There are so many American movies that have this thing in common. Why isn't there a film that shows Americans as the enemy? Who will believe that a lone soldier will destroy the entire army? Do you really think that such a thing would have really happened? Judging from this, an average American observer well brainwashed would certainly do so.
