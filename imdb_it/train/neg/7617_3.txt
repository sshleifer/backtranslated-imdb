It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but Hostel is far worse. This film is more fun and ridiculous, than disturbing. I laughed most of the time when I looked at it. Low quality effects (when you look at it, you'll understand what I'm talking about and how LOW the quality is), bad actors (I hear them for the first time) and it looks like it was shot by an amateur video camera (so it looks more like a TV show , rather than a film). But at least I had the patience to watch it until the end. Like comedies? Watch it. Do you want the horror? Watch Ju-On: The Grudge or some other good horror movie. <br /> <br /> If I'm talking about the Diablo legend, I don't even know if I'll be able to rank it in a horror genre. Just some low budget crap. <br /> <br /> Rated 3 out of 10
