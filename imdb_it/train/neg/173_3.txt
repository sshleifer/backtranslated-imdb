A decent sequel, but it doesn't contain the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless murder, but the film seems very ironic. Any humor is not the funny type. The total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and sometimes Nelson is really exaggerated. This film is about a script that is rewritten before going on the screen ... this should have happened to this script.
