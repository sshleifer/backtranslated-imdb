This is a humble film. It has no real plot. We are never made aware of motivations, other than wealth. The characters are some of the worst actors that have ever been filmed. The threat seems to be supernatural, but then it is controlled by these three elderly people. Why are they doing what they're doing? to scare other group members? I do not know. There is a bit of fog from a smoke machine that rolls in the corridors and everyone seems to be scared of it. Do you do something? I do not know. There is some nudity for its own sake. I'm always surprised to see it in such old movies. Things have actually been established in this sense these days. However, people run like chickens, ready for the ax. They don't have a plan; no resource; nothing. There are about five stupid climaxes in the film. Who are these people and "is there" a ghost or a demon. What happened to other people? I challenge anyone to tell me with confidence. What a mess.
