W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage should be a classic of the English language. If so, a lot must have been lost from the film version here. The attraction of Phillip (Leslie Howard) towards Mildred (Bette Davis) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario look like the post-breakup story of a relationship from a man's point of view. Being a family lawyer I have heard many of these stories; the man portrays himself as noble and always correct, and the woman is a hell that had no other objective than to exploit the man. <br /> <br /> In fact, unless you are willing to laugh at the director's social assumptions, this is an awkward movie to watch. Phillip also indulges in Mildred when she carries a child of undetermined paternity, but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - infuriated and now of questionable sanity - the free run of his apartment with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not occur here. In fact, at the end of the film it looks a lot like the character of Baby Jane who would play thirty years later. <br /> <br /> I observe how Howard's character is always dressed and cared for impeccably. He tells me that Phillip craves the respectability of the middle class. Someone like that couldn't run to a woman with a pretty fast cockney accent. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; such a person would have been more credible if he had been younger, and had the disheveled looks that reveal the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - an Englishman like Raskolnikov. And balanced this allowing Mildred a minimum of charm.
