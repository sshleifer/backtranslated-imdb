I have to admit I liked the first one, and I couldn't wait to start the sequel. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. Of course, the special effects were technically surprising - but they were not credible. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit I like 80% of the chase scene - but fight with all the Smiths? It was too obviously animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept all this. What I can't accept is that the non-action parts were lousy. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I had a speech that went on forever and that meant nothing. I was also disappointed by the little plot that existed. What this film did was tell us that there was no truth in the first film (except on the existence of the matrix). This film was a bit like seeing the DALLAS episode in which you discovered that the entire previous season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
