Once a great action star fell from the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a corpse of a federal agent. Gather with some former co-protagonists to clean up the city. <br /> <br /> A poor key, often to the point of being bland, the "action" comedy mostly doesn't work. Part of the problem is the casting of Chris Klien as a former action hero. it's not bad, but it's not really credible as someone who has been considered a tough guy. As I said, it's not bad, it's just a mixture for what its history is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which in reality is not funny and sometimes seems artificial, and the direction that is pedestrianized at the port of boredom. There is no life in the way things are set. It is as if the director had a list of shots and passed by that list. It's a non-addictive film. Yet the film occasionally comes to life, like the final show that ends the film. That sequence works, but because the previous parts of the film have vanished and dried up much of its power. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend the movie. It's worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or you're a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
