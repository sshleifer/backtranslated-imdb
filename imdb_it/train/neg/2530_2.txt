This film was abysmal. and not in the best way as some have claimed. First of all the main character is a very attractive gingerman. Second: WTF is moving forward with this love van. The plot, in essence, is: the boy wants sex, so he buys a van (which, quite honestly, is quite nice). Incredibly, since it looks like a merman, it scores with lots of chicks! And it fails with some. Then he scores with a very sexy girl and realizes that he loves this sloppy bird that he played hard to get. Then drag the races with the hot girls' boyfriend. And he gives advice to his van. At that point danny devito saves the day. Although he didn't need it because, in overturning the van, the ginger kid crossed the finish line first. I gave this 2 * as I am willing to assume that there is some sort of Vanning subculture of the 70s that I am not getting and also because there is also some boobage from the 70s.
