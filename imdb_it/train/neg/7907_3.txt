An excellent performance by Alix Elias highlights a pile of otherwise disoriented and confused dreck. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with every step, I find less and less pleasure. Why are the munchies so lustful? Has it ever been explained? Are they a reflection of our wild, boring "animal I"? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not just return a touch of subtlety that afflicts this film, and make that connection explicit? Another part of this film that bothers me aimlessly: motorcycles. The jacket that the little monster wears on the cover seems to suggest a 'street-wise' traveler. Sunglasses say "nice guy". With all this I'm ready for Easy Rider who meets the Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What does it give? Stay true to the Gremlins series if you are a fan of small reptilian, wise and reptilian puppets - it will give you the treatment you deserve.
