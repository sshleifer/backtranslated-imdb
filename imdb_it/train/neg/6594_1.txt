I've seen more, if not all of Laurel & Hardy's classic films. I've always liked comically stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film tries to bring the classic back with two new actors that look like both Laurel and Hardy, but fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is the way their clothes are out of place (still in the early 20th century), but they are both portrayed in the 1990s. Some of the previous dialogues have been brought back, but it fails miserably even to approach the classic series. This movie could be the worst movie I've ever seen and should be taken off the shelf and locked up forever. The real Laurel and Hardy are really making their graves turn with such an ugly imitation.
