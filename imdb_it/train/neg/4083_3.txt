I saw this movie when it was released, and my disgust with this stopped me for all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenaway's goal seems to be to take every literary image in the Storm and make it literal. If a character said "my heart takes flight", we would show a real human heart, with pigeon wings attached, waving on the screen. <br /> <br /> This process makes some tableaux lush, but in the end it is an easy exercise. And it becomes deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I don't regret the pleasure that the other spectators found in this film, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience has been kidnapped.
