I liked how it started, with some decent special effects, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There was a pretty impressive scenario. However, the film gets bogged down quite soon with a very stupid dialogue while the males try to flirt with Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius". <br /> <br /> Watching this in the 1990s after a long absence, it was fun to see Francis again, an actress who has done mostly TV shows since this movie was released ... and still stars . It was also interesting to see a young Leslie Nielsen ("Dr. John J. Adams"), whom I would not have recognized had it not been for this voice <br /> <br /> I watched half of this film before boredom arrived almost overwhelming and I had a strong desire to go to sleep. I appreciated them re-doing this VHS tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. This is one of those overrated films in which the "elites" think it is so "heavy" and "stimulating". It is nonsense. He just seemed "smart" because the rest of the 1950s sci-fi movies were so stupid !! <br /> <br /> Some if the first scenes would have been magnificent on the big screen, which I didn't have at the time of this writing. Perhaps another aspect - this time on widescreen 2.35: 1 transfer would make me change this review.
