When I was a kid in the 70s, a local theater hosted children's Matin√©es every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (does anyone remember those?). They showed this one year over Christmas. Some friends and I went to see it. I was expecting a nice Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly nicknamed (of course) and really creepy movie. <br /> <br /> Something about Santa and Merlin the Magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) Satan (some joker in a silly devil costume with horns!). The images made me shudder in my place. I always found spooky Santa to start with, so it didn't help. The guy in Satan's suit didn't help. But what REALLY upset me was the wooden deer that pulled Santa's sleigh. When he injured them and the disturbing sound they made and the movements - I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later I still remember getting out of that theater more than disturbed by what I saw. Even my friends were scared of it. I just saw an ad for this on TV and ALL those nightmares are back roaring. This is a creepy, creepy little Christmas movie that will probably scare every kid who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets a 1.
