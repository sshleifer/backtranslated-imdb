- = contains spoilers from both the original and the film version = - <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of the Notre Dame de Paris musical, I also read a book this summer and watched the movie today, all I was confident to see a good movie, especially when I saw 6.3 points of IMDb. The first scenes were good but in reality I was waiting for the theater scene directly from the book, but it was normal, but when Esmeralda kissed the gringo I felt that something was wrong ... they didn't even kiss in the book, even in the musical .. <br /> <br /> and there was a huge void because Esmeralda was judged by the sorcerer, in the book he teaches his goat how to respond to the clock numbers or write the word "phoebus" .. Wait until there was a phoebus not c 'was? in this film he is nothing more than a garbage soldier, the creators made Quasimodo's love to show around and even erased Frollo's love ... but Notre Dame was weak. his thoughts his struggles between the love of god and love for the human in the film we can not find anything like that, all we have is, a villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts .. and not mentioning phoebus, not mentioning the love of frollo, not mentioning jehan (brother of frollo) without mentioning the mother of Esmeralda (perhaps it is OK, the plot would have minced a lot) have not even mentioned the true story .. (another PS: frollo was not an opus dei or a bit of cult member who actually is interested in alchemy, trying to make gold ... he was stuck in science and religion) <br /> <br /> finally do not watch this film, it is a kind of director in a true masterpiece, and if you looked at it before reading the book, God have mercy on you .. you must read to book immediately .. <br /> <br / > this film is worse than the hunchback of Notre Dame the animated film, spend your time watching the Notre Dame de Pa musical ris .. quite said ..
