I rented this movie yesterday mainly because of the beautiful art and the summary on the back of the jacket. After inserting it into my DVD player I reviewed the jacket cover and even though I removed the cover from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any of the detailed information about the production of the film. This movie is called Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to the Faith Films website to find out any linkage here on IMDb. <br /> <br /> The film's filming and special effects seemed pretty good ... THEN, an actor reading the line spoke. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like a high-school athlete with a pimply face, whose voice has just managed to change tone and no attempt to go beyond reading the script lines. At first I thought I had a bad record out of audio sync, then I had to assume it was a foreign film since I couldn't read the jacket ... the dubbed English dialogue. If they had cast the right person for the dubbing of the dialogue, this film MAY have been decent. I gave him a chance of about 20 minutes before expelling him when I discovered that the line reader would not be killed, but remain as the main constant tool. Yes, it's so bad! The covers of the covers and the works made in the film are fantastic, so it gave the only star, but less than 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialogue. I don't recommend this!
