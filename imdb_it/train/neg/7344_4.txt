This is the story of a young woman seduced and then abandoned by her older and married lover after she became pregnant; does she retaliate against him, and all his family, through black magic? which, disappointing, does not do itself but has someone else for you. Good production values ​​for a Thai horror film. But the bland script never generates suspense, the director approaches the subject in a completely conventional way, and the final act loses the viewer's sympathy for the victims by throwing the logic to the winds. At one point, a character has the main opportunity to shoot to death, but instead he gets up and runs away without taking the gun. Bad writing ?? you are diving! <br /> <br /> Some swollen effects of gore, including a corpse of the fetus at the end of life really tasteless and a guy who dies from blowing up hundreds of eels lives from the stomach. Recommended only for completers of the genre who simply have to watch all the horror films produced in Asia over the last 15 years.
