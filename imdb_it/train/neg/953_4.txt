"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things to do. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British version (Excelsior Films) of an M-G-M musical complete with second-level stars. I imagine Vera-Ellen took this role thinking she could finally push her to the status of a great musical star. But, sorry to say, Miss Ellen's chance didn't pay off. <br /> <br /> Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling through a terrible dialogue until the next boring tone, this movie looks very heavy and sloppy. The predictable plot of mistaken identity is very subtle, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is very exaggerated in his role as a producer) and Bobby Howes (who is completely wasted in a role nothing) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable. <br /> <br /> The choreography is boring, but Mrs Ellen gives everything. She has never been as famous as most other musical stars (and she shouldn't be that since she didn't know how to sing and even had a "dance bench" in many of her photos. "But when she danced, it was just exciting. <Br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie that could have made it a star hadn't given her the tools she needed to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
