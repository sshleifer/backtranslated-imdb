Desperately inept and boring film in which the characters wander in the rooms or in a spaceship and talk endlessly. You might think that things would come back to life when they explore Mars, but these scenes are shot through a red / orange filter that makes everything very dark. The Martian landscape / vegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are not entirely convincing. There are echoes of "Bride Of The Monster" when the heroine carefully wraps the octopus as a tentacle of a meat that eats the plant around her before weakly floating, with the difference that Ed Wood's film is a hundred times more fun . Better to wear ear plugs when you look otherwise, the "science fiction" soundtrack, repeated ad infinitum, will drive you crazy. If you find yourself unable to sleep one night, insert it into the VCR and your insomnia will be healed in no time.
