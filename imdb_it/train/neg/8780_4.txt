Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Shortly thereafter, he is contacted by Dr. Price, an expert on Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims to have received messages from Jonathan's dead wife, Anna, through various electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to say something to Jonathan? Is it just a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It's nice to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story with which he is blocked is twisted and absurd in the points; it's as if the film didn't know how to answer any of the questions it poses, so it simply distracts the viewer with new unrelated questions. <br /> <br /> Keaton himself is quite good, convincingly interpreted as a grieving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the extravagant boyish roles he played 15 years earlier. He looks a bit steep, with a few more wrinkles than might be expected, but he has not lost the cunning and brio he showed during his quarter century in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> So it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is poor. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot becomes more confusing as it proceeds, each winding path ends in another winding path. This is all right if the path leads to a sort of acceptable epilogue, something that binds more or less all together and explains ... something. But not the white noise; I knew less than what had happened to Jonathan of what I had done before I saw him. <br /> <br /> Keaton is really the only reason to look at this stuff, even if it receives great support from Ian McNeice (like Dr. Price) and Deborah Kara Unger as the love interest required.
