Seriously, I read some reviews on this film, and I have to ask you, you were people watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the directors a lot of credit for being able to recreate the vintage 1930s Los Angeles, but then? <br /> <br /> None of the characters are funny, the story seems to be pointless, Karen Black is not simply a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had the creepy child actor, the creeping Billy Barty, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that love cinema and the rest of us look at each other and say "What the hell!"
