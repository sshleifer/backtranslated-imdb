a love story without feeling, a drama of problems with no point (or drama) .... This film should be all this and fails on all accounts, as if it didn't try. Or as if the director / publisher / screenwriter team didn't really try. Actors are able - they need better support. <br /> <br /> An element that does not fail is the score of George Delarue. Beautiful and moving. What a pity it is related to this film. In a good film, the words and movements of the actors and the music synchronize and improve the impact. This editor is engraved on the music without any regard for dialogue and movement. The love scene is particularly gratifying in this sense: an insult to the talents of the main actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the film that works: location photography. Greatly a moment in Grand Central Station. I had guessed in advance what would have happened; but as it was shot in that setting it was breathtaking. Some commentators on this forum have pointed out that the assimilation of Nazi criminal scientists in the United States actually took place during these years of fear of MacCarthy. As the film seems to start looking seriously at American society, it moves on to conventional romanticism; before any human feeling can move us, it is away in a (predictable) thriller adventure. <br /> <br /> Just as the film insults the talents of the actors, it insults the problems it claims (and fails) to take. <br /> <br /> You are advised.
