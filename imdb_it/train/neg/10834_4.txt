Sorry, did I miss something? did i leave early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) Stories made me think "This will be a classic" But it was all down the hill from there! The acting was brilliant, for what it's worth William H Macy's is fantastic and every movie in which I watch it is getting better and better. But it never seemed to connect. I was waiting for the big moment when all the stories connect and then suddenly. it was if the writer said "I went deep, how can I pull all these stories together skillfully ... Oh well, I'll just rain the frogs". I like smart movies, I like strange movies but this was just weird and boring. 4/10
