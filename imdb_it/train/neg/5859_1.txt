Turkish cinema has a big problem. The directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folkloristic, but they want to be international. This leads to kitsch results like this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish and have no meaning for the non-Turkish public. Even for the Turkish public after 10 years. <br /> <br /> The players, even Ferhan SENSOY have a worse acting average. They act like puppets. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in Cuba, but nothing concerns Cuba. So Cuba is thought of as a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Waste of money, waste of time.
