Even more boring, if possible, than the original (I hope I can say it under the IMDb guidelines). THE FRENCH COLLEGE at least tried to absorb European influences, complicating the conventional view of the American police detective, even if the attempt was sunk by ambivalence, Americanity and indirect Friedkin addressing. The (relative) boom of the 1960s (especially with the nouvelle vague) allowed a great influence of European cinema in Hollywood. This has given new strength and complexity to a tired medium, and, at best (eg BONNIE AND CLYDE, at the beginning Scorcese), a new subversion of the received practice. The original CONNECTION was part of this movement, with its difficult-to-distance style and anti-detective figure. DUE is the right-wing reaffirmation of old Hollywood's old values ​​of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This is evident in the annoying America vs France dialectic of the film. For example, DUE is shot as a French policeman in the 1970s. It was the French, of course, who insisted on the greatness of American films when they were ignored at home, and this, in a sense, is a claim, a warning against Gallic presumption. This can be seen in the scheme of the two films. CONNECTION has French gangsters who invade New York, with the French style that suffocates the American thriller - this leads to the dissolution of the detective's figure and to the rudeness of the plot - the bad guy escaped. <br /> <br /> DUE has the American who returns to France, with the values ​​of the American thriller imposed on the native genre: the power of the detective is reaffirmed and a conventional resolution is reached. This is further dramatized in Doyle's relationship with the French inspector Barthelmy, whose dominant influence must be resolved before he can control the plot. <br /> <br /> DUE seems to follow the original undermining his investigative hero. From the beginning, the importance of Doyle diminished with each turn. Despite the end of CONNECTION, he is considered a hero. But he is an American in a foreign land and his inability to control language or habits means that he cannot dominate the plot. He even misunderstood police signs, exchanging an informant for a criminal and making him kill. <br /> <br /> The power of a detective derives from his power as a subject to see and interpret, but Doyle spends much of the film being watched, controlled, an object, a body (literally in the scenes after it was downloaded from Charnier) to view and interpret. In CONNECTION, he instigated the action, chasing criminals, forcing the plot; here he is passive, tied to a bed, locked up in a cell, a drug addict, an employee. <br /> <br /> This loss of phallic power is symbolically symbolized in the loss of his gun, and the film follows a depressing Oedipal trajectory. In heroin sequences, he is comforted by an old lady who says he looks like her son. His drugged state is like a return to the womb, robbed of adult pressure. She takes the clock strengthens the timelessness of this state, doubly significant for a man whose career depends on time and accuracy. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective, and to avoid his fate, Doyle must reject this false mother who is dissolving her unified identity and killing her father (Charnier) so that she can take on her male role accepted in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among academics in the 1970s (ironically instigated by a Frenchman, Jacques Lacan), but it is rare to see a film so literally full of it. <br /> <br /> If all these facts tended to minimize Doyle, then the style of the film does not. Friedkin turned us away from his hero by rejecting the empathy or motivation of the character, focusing on the mechanics of the plot. Here, Doyle is a very conventional Hollywood hero. Instead of being lost in a long turbid shot, it is made understandable and understandable to the viewer with traditional devices: shots from the point of view, close-ups, connection shots, etc. <br /> <br /> TWO is about the fall and rise of Popeye Doyle. The plot in this case is subject to acting, which is the usual Hackman showiness. The cold scenes of the turkey, therefore, despite their boringness, do not disturb. We are authorized to share rather than observe coldly; this experience is much less annoying. The scenes are also crossed by a virile and tearful, very American sentimentality. <br /> <br /> So while CONNECTION has tried to imitate Jean Pierre Melville's complex thrillers, TWO does the opposite. Melville's SAMOURAI featured a gangster who had started the film in a complete, powerful way, out of the tongue, and plotted his eventual disintegration. DUE begins with a disintegrated character, achieved in part through the inability with language, whose domination begins when it comes out of language - the final action sequences are largely speechless. <br /> <br /> In the film, the locale and language are important as they fix and undermine the detective, but when he regains his power (figured in the return of his gun, and the cathartic fire of the primal site of vulnerability the block of the tower where Charnier held it), the Marseille setting becomes more irrelevant, and the mythical stand-off, which could take place anywhere, takes over. Compare the endings of the two films: ambiguity and despair are admitted, the other absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
