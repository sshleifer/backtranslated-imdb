Chilly, an alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an army captain returning from service during World War II with his altered memory (there is now an original idea!). It seems that he remembers the old flame Glenda Jackson but not his current wife, Julie Christie, which should be enough to trigger some emotional sparks. This extremely refined soaper brings together the protagonist Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are all running out. There are a number of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' rhythm is incredibly slow and the film's dull color is unnerving. Long on the shelf, this "Soldier" is best left forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
