This is another typical and incredible Hollywood dreck piece. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a suit and tie, convinces me that he was a second best baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic cop is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual cardboard self, and does little to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene of this persipo is absolutely predictable until the end when Kurt hits Ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. Kurt and Madeline then make their obligatory end-of-film embrace, and ALL - except Russell and Stowe, KNOW Liotta gets up and threatens the couple again. <br /> <br />, of course, and Russell drilled it 10 times with his 9mm, which was COMPLETELY unnecessary. This film could very well end up with the club scene --- EXCEPTION that Hollywood punctuates unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "improve", more burr damage.
