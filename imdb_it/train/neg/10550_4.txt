After being a big fan of the ten-minute episodes of "Stella Street", I waited for this film with enthusiasm and anticipation. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was shocked by the fact that almost all the gags and a liner were raised directly from the TV episodes, and delivered with much less enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had spoken them once, and we should not have bothered to repeat them. I bought my copy on DVD and felt defrauded that I had separated from my hard-earned profits to watch the same lines. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS * The film's plot begins with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually populated by "some of the most famous people on stage and screen in the last forty years", including including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities on the street end up being scammed by all the fate of a local scammer and are forced to live as vagabonds and ordinary working class people. There are some good moments, but overall the writers manage to get an interesting idea and make it rather boring. * END OF SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In the episodes of T.V, all the characters are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was a mistake. His imitations weren't funny, and his characters seemed to be included in the story just to give her something to do. <br /> <br /> If you weren't a fan of the Stella Street episodes, you might find this movie funny. But if you were a fan, I think you could go away feeling a little cheated. 4/10
