This series gets 2 stars only because it stages some of Dickens' Bleak Houses and maybe someone will read the book. Contrary to what was probably received, Diana Rigg was as poor as Lady Dedlock. It was awkward and wooden. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is wrong, wrong, wrong for Mr. Jarndyce. So I stop and answer all those people who are saying, "I haven't read the book, so I don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his assessments on the book." True and not true. For example, Diana Rigg is bad in her role due to poor acting, whether you've read the book or not. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (although too old). The series fails not because it is unfair to compare it to the book, but because the various lines and characters do not combine to create coherent, dramatic, mysterious and compelling entertainment. It's boring and flat. If you want to make Bleak House possible, you have to spend 20 hours of film in 10 two-hour episodes. But I suggest that the producers etc. Leaving Dickens alone (also A Christmas Carol). Television dampens the genius of Dickens as it manifests itself in his brilliant plots and unforgettable characters.
