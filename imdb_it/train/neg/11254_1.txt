"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" (an incredibly inappropriate title) is simply a bad movie; he has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special about it. Yes, CGI wallpapers look interesting, but the result is that everything is shot in an annoying soft focus. Furthermore, the film uses music in the same way, for example, as "Gilligan's Island" or as Scooby-Doo cartoons - NEVER STOP. Terribly, simply terrible. There are not even new ideas, just spits and spits and ... etc., of pieces taken from old movies and series. There is no guardian here, the film seems to exist because it can do it. Save your money and your time. Not funny at all.
