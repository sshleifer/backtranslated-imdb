What we have here is a film about how the search for money and revenge can corrupt your soul ... or something like that. Guy Ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites more than he can chew with this. <br /> <br /> His use of modern noir to address the theme of a man who gets rid of swallowing his pride, being kind to his enemy and giving away all his money falls flat on his face. When the character of Jason Statham doesn't fear Ray Liotta anymore, it seems that Liotta is crazy enough to blow the head in the final scene. Why? Basically it is not possible to create a mafioso like the character of Liotta, who presumably arrived at his position in life by showing the kind of ruthless behavior evident throughout the film, only then that drove him to suicide from nothing but a compassionate smile on the face of the Statham character. <br /> <br /> Before anyone starts saying that I miss the point ... I'm not. Did I get it right? Give up the search for riches and you will find true happiness and inner peace. Be kind to your enemy and this will confuse him in self-destruction. This seems to be the essence of the film and in itself is not a bad premise for a story, even if it is hardly original. The problem is that Ritchie simply doesn't have the ability as a director to make it happen. The moment that Guy Ritchie also realizes this, he seems to get bored with the story and starts to insert the red-herring: the scene in which Statham is hit by a car - Why? Shooting some scenes like Marvel's comic animations ... again, why? <br /> <br /> There are so many free threads and unanswered questions at the end of the film that you could get all of 2001-ish about it, try to understand them, or simply accept that there are no answers and every viewer will interpret things in his way. Myself? I was so bored by the pompous tone of the movie that I just didn't care. Frankly, the ending could not have come too soon, so that I no longer had to endure more than this pretentious psycho babble. <br /> <br /> A waste of two hours of my life.
