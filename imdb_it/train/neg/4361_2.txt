Using the video sacked by Planet of Dinosaurs, this video shot (with the exception of the stolen movie) concerns a group of people shot in space who land on a planet of dinosaurs that is ... don't wait for it, it's really earth. It's a five-minute sketch stretched to 90 minutes. Slightly better than Chickboxer (another from the Bad Movie Police series) - with a nostalgic home movie combined with good stolen effects, this film is still an impossible slogan to overcome. I was left to reflect on the question that we are becoming so un-creative that we are now pillaging old movies not only for the plot but also for mismatched movies? Clearly low budget producers are becoming so desperate that they will really give us anything to take our money
