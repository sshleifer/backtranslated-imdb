A girl is taking a shower without knowing that a serial rapist is staring at her through the skylight. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are on his way, but not as hot as they are after killing, raping and eating a girl's nipple. It's a deadly shot. Hopefully this would be the end of the film. Not because it's too terrifying, but because the level of acting is terribly horrible. Unfortunately it is not the end and months later the rapist resurrected as a zombie from a congregation of Satanists. So he continues where he left off, with the detectives on the case again, this time a flying child chases him too (don't ask). There have been VERY MUCH VERY cheap movies (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty come to mind), but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel. The horrible acting, the memorable special effects of shit, the lame attempt at comedy and oh yes, and the ending also sucks. <br /> <br /> My Vote: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Theresa Bestul gets fully naked; Anne R.
