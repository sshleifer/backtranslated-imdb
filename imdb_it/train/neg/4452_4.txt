Let's say that I had to suspend less the disbelief for Spiderman than for the Hooligans. I mean, to say, I have less trouble believing that Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than Elija Wood does when he throws down the bulls in Manchester. I won't go into specifics, since I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of ​​grown-up, professional, British men who come close to being almost deadly every weekend is, well ... funny. And this film is not. The fight, the idea of ​​fighting, is taken too seriously. The gravity of boxing, the reverence with which matter is treated, becomes irritating, since it does not establish or resolve conflict. It seems that the plot, with holes large enough to drive a Guinness truck, has been slapped together with a "fish out of water" theme, so that viewers can watch Wood's watery eyes as he learns to become a man. . hit other youngsters of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then escape as quickly as possible. The characters are cartoonists, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and the plot are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the image. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film does not reach its height until almost the end, at which point you will have spent almost two hours of your life without ever turning back. Collect "The Football Factory" or "Fight Club" instead of this trivial, and disappointing disaster. He wastes no time with the empty melodrama, the tired old "Yankee in the court of King Aurthur", or the tears, parables of upcoming bullsh * t. They are just pure, dark and intelligent fun; the way violence should be.
