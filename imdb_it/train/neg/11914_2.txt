Shiri Appleby is the prettiest little incarnation of evil that has become a good demon girl kicking at the Buffy clone, Elle. But I'm moving forward, I see Lilith was the first woman God created as Adam's companion. But she got all the evil feminists so God banished her from Eden. A clandestine order known as The Fath captures it but does not kill it, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained so well) Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy clone who must fight with a crazy scientist who received an injection of blood from Lilith. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph seemed horribly complicated, it is because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and for a film with a plot full of theology, it does not seem to be aware of it. Apparently, the CGIed movie in the basement was a failed series pilot. All I can say to the fact that it was not taken into consideration is a resounding Amen. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Commentary by Writer / Director Bill Platt and Co-writer Chris Regina; and the Stills gallery; samples of video effects: before and after (it also has an "available" selection which I think would take you to some trailers, but not to DVD covers for other films, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> Extra for DVD-ROM: final shooting script and transcription of deleted scenes both in PDF format
