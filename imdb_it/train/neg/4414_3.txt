Christopher Durang must have been taught by a terribly memorable nun, because he can't let go of the concept. The play, "Sister Mary Ignatius explains it all for you", was presented - at least in Hollywood - in exactly the same tone as the scenes of Diane Keaton. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a raspberry, an acute satire of a quietly trusting, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun - and as interpreted by Lynn Redgrave, it was exhilarating. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the scenes "explains everything". The two approaches collide precipitously and in the last twenty minutes, the film leaves the track, plunges into the throat and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their meeting with Sister Mary, had been taken as Sister Mary's scenes. Or if the scenes of Sister Mary were presented in a more realistic way. This way it just doesn't work at all.
