Kris Kristofferson, at his merciless climax in the mid-1970s, barely finds himself able to reach the screen next to La Streisand's gigantic ego and discount feminism. <br /> <br /> None of the characters are really nice; I was happy when Kristofferson's Ferrari fell on that hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good rock and roll celebrity film, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made only for about a year and a half after this dreck).
