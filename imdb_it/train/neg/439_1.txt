Only a rip-off by the infinitely better "Murder, She Wrote", it is absolutely incredible that this badly written garbage lasted for eight years. I'm sure most of the people who witnessed this non-adventurous crap were between the ages of sixty and seventy and tuned in simply because they had nothing better to do, or simply remembered his star from the old Dick Van Dyke Show. Van Dyke, who had only a decent career in the 1960s, had never been an actor at all (by his own admission) and was already too old to play a doctor when the series began in 1993. It looks absolutely ancient as a result of years of chain smoking and alcoholism. His lifeless talent, his son Barry, a wooden actor who rarely participated in something that does not involve his father, plays his son in the series.
