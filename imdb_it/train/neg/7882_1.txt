After stopping by the cinema to find something to watch, we came across this. It seemed interesting from the summary, at least, so we tried. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's actually fun! Oh wait, I talked too soon. <br /> <br /> Somewhere in there, the film took a disgusting turn in a fundamental Christian washing of the right brain. Not quite sure what happens, but I think the writer found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script and didn't have time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting with his friends from the Westboro Church and the his hood was not not to clean. <br /> <br /> Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Just as video games have classification systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is about to take a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> Unless you share your feelings with any moron they invented this story, and they open the Bible to you while you watch this and plan how to convert your neighbors, don't waste time. It is one of the worst garbage that has come out in a long time, and radical nuns no longer need funding.
