Allen goes to the country (he hates going somewhere in real life) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual types of white bourgeois successful sweets that characterize many of his films. <br /> <br /> I usually find something to amuse in Woody Allen's comedies, but here he really finds himself completely on the ground. Even the performers seem to have abandoned him. The plot is not true (pieces of shit and pieces of Shakespeare cod) - but Allen seems to use the position to allow a semi-mystical air, which makes it even more cruel and half-cooked. <br /> <br /> It simply doesn't work at any level and is just a gigantic bore. The best thing about this movie (apart from the upcoming credits) is that the negative reviews seem to wake him up and realize that the simple fact of putting together a script and sending your mates isn't for entertainment.
