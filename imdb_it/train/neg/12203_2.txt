I think it's time for John Rambo to go on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a soldier but a cold-blooded killer. Every time someone appears on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place and frankly I'm tired of Hollywood making it look like it was. This is not the worst film about Vietnam, that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal machine gun that seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good number of Russians is an insult to watch. What's worse is Rambos's guru speech at the end ... Please !! Oh yes, I heard they are doing another ...
