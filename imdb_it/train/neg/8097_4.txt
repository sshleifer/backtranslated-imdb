Considered by many critics as one of the greatest fools of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of the career of director Brian De Palma). Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is a smug boy whose life falls apart when he and his lover Maria Ruskin (Melanie Griffith) are involved in a hit and run. His story is told by another smug journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis). <br /> <br /> Well, as I said in my summary ... <br /> <br /> What is this movie supposed to be? It seems to combine comedy, drama and satire, but it certainly doesn't add up to much. It is undermined by unimaginable and one-dimensional characters that you will never want to have the regret of meeting in real life. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of the novel (I started reading it once, but I couldn't finish it because I didn't like it) but it's obvious to me that those who have / enjoy the novel consider this film a complete parody. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many talented actors strive to give a below average film a semblance of quality and fail. What a waste. <br /> <br /> The problems begin with the casting of the good boy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unpleasant. And Peter Fallow's role in the novel was that of an Englishman. Bruce Willis is bloody miserable in the role. What was he thinking there. <br /> <br /> Alas, not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his intact dignity, being obliged to hold a lame and heavy lecture on "decency" after the climax. /> <br /> This film ends up turning into an absurd farce. <br /> <br /> I liked the editing of talents; that's why I'll give it four out of ten, but I'm sure some people will say that MUCH could have made a better film out of the original material.
