Ummm, please forgive me, but did not miss more than half of the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then tried several times to escape. It breaks conditional freedom and is pursued relentlessly by police inspector Javert. Along the way there are many characters that were not in this version. Some noteworthy are Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the film, trying to figure out how it was somehow connected to Victor Hugo's epic novel.
