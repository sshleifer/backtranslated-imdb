This is another one of the many films of group B marked as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - screenplay, acting, directing - are mediocre. The recitation of the three cables is of wood. I imagine that John Dall would have to go to the world of cinema, but then someone realized he had little talent and then ended up doing the work on TV. Lee J Cobb, who is usually exceptional, cannot overcome the script and bad direction. Jane Wyatt should be a femme fatale but fails to convince viewers. The film has two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, one in which John Dall chases Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. DVD transfer is typical Alfa.
