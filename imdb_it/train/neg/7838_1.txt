This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of the party of five had taken possession of it and made a t.v. movie. The film lacks what Velvet Goldmine had, which was good acting, writing and pretty much everything else. The film had some of the worst scripts I saw from the Wild Wild West. It absolutely had to be interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind musical performances. which are much better than anything that would have worked if it was an episode behind the musical episode, but it wasn't and it felt right on his face.
