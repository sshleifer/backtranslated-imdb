This film sees among others "SlapChop" Vince Offer (which he also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - not exactly names that shout "quality". And with scenes so exciting as "Supermodels taking a dump" (it is exactly as it seems), a guy who steals a sperm bank (the "Rhymer"), a necrophilia with a rotting corpse, black market fetuses (with a boy who digs what they should be out of a jar), lots of gay jokes, a skit on a giant phallus that is a superhero and forced abortions. The scenes are painfully little amusing (like "Batman and Rhymer"), the acting is not good enough to be considered amateur and the film is raw only for the sake of being rude ... and stupid. I truly believe that an 8 year old group could EASILY make a more fun movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> Apparently this film led to a lawsuit from "Slap Shot" Vince against Scientologists. Frankly, I wouldn't know who to cheer for in this case !!! Apparently, he said that somehow the Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film. It doesn't matter that the film is repellent garbage from beginning to end and 99% not funny (by comparison, Ebola is more fun) ... and these are the most beautiful things I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> way, this is Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") wearing a diaper and participating in the fake porn movie. It is incredible that his career can overcome this.
