I'm looking at the list of the top 100 AFI comedies, and I have to say this is really one of the worst. Not just of the 90 films on the list I've seen, but of any movie I've ever seen. Drunks are sometimes funny, Dudley not. Liza has almost made it worth it, but alas ... go see Arrested Development if you want to see it in something good. Seriously, Dudley who laughs and drinks should be fun? I highly recommend almost every other film on the 100 AFI comedies for more laughter than this. If you want to see a "drunk" more fun, try The Thin Man. More fun movie in general, any Marx Brothers movie will kill (especially if you're drunk like Arthur).
