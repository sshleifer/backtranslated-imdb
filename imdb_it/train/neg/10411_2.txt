It is funny. I've seen a lot of Fassbinder films and found some extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes - like this movie. For me, it goes from big to shit - without much in the way. I know he has a lot of "sophisticated" fans, but I can't help thinking that much of his charm is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get a lot of negative votes for it), he made too many films too quickly and was too self-indulgent. His gay or genre movies (like this one) tend to be really bad - badly done, sometimes quite boring (like QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS by PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just coarse (like this movie). Can his message about accepting a person's gender confusion be handled better than what is shown while slaughtering or looking at macabre slaughtered cows? Show a certain sensitivity to the topic and make your characters more human and understanding - so maybe I would be interested in movies. <br /> <br /> I am honestly to the point after seeing this film that I no longer bother with other Fassbinder films: the villain seems to be too heavy for his weight.
