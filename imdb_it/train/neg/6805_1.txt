I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. But I still can't believe what I saw. <br /> <br /> This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If I had to list all the flaws in the film, this review would bring me a lot of sentences (very funny flaws, due to the fact that it's so ugly) <br /> <br /> You have to be amazed with the skill of the assigned commandos to save the plane. they didn't even know how to move. <br /> <br /> Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and the thing I don't understand, is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero .. <br /> <br /> of course the main defects will be the landing of a 747, which requires only 3 or 4 points from a guy in transmission to land on the plane ... unbelievable .. as well as the corpses that had almost nothing of blood .. <br /> <br /> But I highly recommend watching this movie, because it is very interesting to see how bad something can go
