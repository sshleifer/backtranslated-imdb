I took TRAN SCAN from the library and took it home. We considered taking a trip east and we thought we'd get an idea of ​​what it was like. The film was a complete waste of time, if I went to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw that it costs $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD worked for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride all over Canada with my stomach feeling sick as they went up and down the curve at high speed. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of footage that probably turned on this and it was thought that they could have made a better product. If I had done this project, I would have provided more shots, stopped on the road signs to let the people where they were and linger in places to see the landscape. To make a film like this it should be 60 to 90 minutes. Oh yes, the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a hiss from the accelerated sound of the car, the thet could at least put some music to it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross-country film look at The railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster keaton (the one from the last film he made) in this comic film Buster Keaton gets on a railway track in Nova Scotia and travels in British Columbia
