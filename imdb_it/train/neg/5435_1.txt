... did they worry about making this movie? Anyone? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a training film, take the summer of '42. This summer is not from '42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, and Sarsgaard gets more screen time, this is your first warning sign And, of course, for such an "artistic" film, there is a lots of curses and leather thrown around, just to make it look "artistic". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard did his usual, uninteresting, cartoon character, punctuated by moments that should have been intense. The intensity is that of someone with bipolar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is most famous for his looks and what he said about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her. He misrepresented a real Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the acting style of cardboard. Wow! Was this your first role after graduating from high school? <br /> <br /> So, we have this strange triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but he is with his boss / girlfriend. He can't take Miller to bed, and he won't bring his boss to bed. So get stuck with Sarsgaard & Miller, and watch them do it. <br /> <br /> Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller does it, a scene that we are "treated" in every sloppy and plaintive detail. Finally, just to round it all off, Foster and Sarsgaard wear it, with Foster playing the role of Miller. Now I know how 2 guys do it (like it's all I needed to know). <br /> <br /> After all that remains is the tragic ending for a character and the retrospective visions of the remaining 2. It takes me right into the belly of my stomach. Oh wait! This was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> I'd like to go back to the time this film took my life, please.
