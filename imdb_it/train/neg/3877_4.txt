I just saw The Incredible Melting Man for the second time, and it was even more boring than when I first saw it. I don't understand why it has become a "cult classic" when it's so boringly boring. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the can of blood and runs for her dear life. After that, all that really happens is that the melting man wanders around woods and houses, while he has flashbacks to his astronaut life. The make-up is pretty good, and her loose, sticky face looks pretty realistic. There is a beautiful scene in which he throws a man's head into a river, and floats up to a waterfall where he falls on rocks and opens in bursts. There's not much to get wet though, most of the scenes are shot in the dark and you can't really see what's going on. There is not much blood, at least on the Vipco DVD I saw. <br /> <br /> No, The Incredible Melting Man is by no means exceptional. I'll give the votes for his cheese factor, but that's all. If you want a true science fiction / horror cult, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
