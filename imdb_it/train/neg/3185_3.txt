This film has just been criticized by MST3K and with good reason. First of all because it is a "cop" movie starring Joe Don Baker, which we all know as a good cop actor like Michael Jackson is a country western singer. <br /> <br /> All the typical plot of the detective film the devices have their ugly heads, clashes with bartenders, hostages of children in shootings, bad recitatives, lame police chiefs, bad acting, revenge / justice, mistakes interminable and, of course, bad acting. Don't look at this without a MST3K people filter.
