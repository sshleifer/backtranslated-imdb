I have to admit that I'm just a university student at this time, an English major in that. At the time when I saw this film I was a high school student: I mean a junior year but he may have been old, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes more or less to my course in physics, an interest in quantum mechanics that led me to read on the subject in a series of books on the theoretical aspects of the field and on any article I can find in Discover and the like. I am not a PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... <br /> <br /> This film is simply terrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe as it is special to everyone. My mother is such a person and since she saw this movie she has tried to convince all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. I tried to highlight the various defects and problems that I had seen with the logic and science of the film - and they are numerous - and rejected my statements because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with research doctorates ". In this case, apparently. <br /> <br /> Leaving behind the fact that earning a doctorate does not necessarily require a person to be correct or, indeed, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to eradicate half of the film. Leaving behind, the directors completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it look like they supported their beliefs when, in reality, they had completely opposed them. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I think the intuitor did a great job resizing the movie, so feel free to read that if you're interested in doing it. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
