The last reviewer was very generous. I like the first movie, but I can't say I really appreciate this. The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill rather quickly. I don't see Jon Bon Jovi as a "bad vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. Many scenes make no sense. I mean that any normal person would suspect that something happened when a strange woman suddenly appears out of nowhere to seduce you, not to mention an experienced hunter. Why is Una able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing has ever been explained in this film, you wouldn't mind if it was fun, but it was too much to ask. This must be one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen.
