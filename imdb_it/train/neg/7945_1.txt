The film so confuses religious ethics and ideals that it fails to create coherent arguments against the death penalty at any level. Presenting the legitimate execution of a murder condemned as a catalyst for the apocalyptic end of humanity, the film elevates a parent murderer to the status of martyr for Christ. Somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged by the fact that the company chose to get rid of a fanatic who killed his parents by making them burn as they slept helplessly in their beds. Yet this same god has no indignation at the killer's acts. The main character, a non-religious pregnant suicide woman, eventually gives her life in an attempt to challenge but not plausible to save this doomed murderer without success. In other threads of the underdeveloped plot, Jesus returns as a helpless and frustrated wanderer to symbolically unleash God's wrath. The modern oppressive incarnation of Christ not only dehumanizes him, but also derides the messianic ideal of all religions. It is not able to positively influence humanity and, in no uncertain terms, it skates the boundaries of life waiting for humanity to destroy itself. Meanwhile, with a little help from Jesus, the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate in her soulless newborn baby that somehow saves all of humanity from the wrath of the almighty. I also interpreted it as a statement supporting abortion on some levels. This film, which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller, fails to make any religious point of view that I can clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. It raises many questions that it does not even try to answer. It ignores the religious values ​​of its audience as it attempts to portray a donkey version of their realization. fool
