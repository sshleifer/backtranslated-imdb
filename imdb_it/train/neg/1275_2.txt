This is a horrible movie. All three stories are supported by a psychiatric hypnotist line that is not necessary and all the stories are bad. The first is about wild wolves and some women, there are some things that make no sense, but the thing about hypnotism makes up for it. The second, with the villain Bill Paxton as a manic roommate, should not be seen by anyone. The last one, unfortunately, the best is almost incomprehensible that I imagine makes it better than the other refusal.
