Morone and girl conduct rituals to revive the dead, in an attempt to prove that the dead cannot be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they succeed in resurrecting a dead soul that begins to cut it into pieces with an ax, and the next day some old college people tell the story around a bonfire. The guy with the ax gets up and starts to tear the idiots who tell the story. The group calls the policemen, the policeman sees the blood splashing everywhere and he thinks it is a mountain lion (!?) And soon after he is thrown by a deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost. <br /> <br /> Moronic a small splatter film that was shot in daylight but where different characters are carrying flashlights and talking as if it were the middle of the night, and wanting to send a flash of the signal to attract attention . A guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but he doesn't bother loading it, then after finally loading it, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but he doesn't bother to do it, because that would end the movie too soon. So throw the gun away! The characters that show no emotion and don't seem the least bit worried after their friends were made into small pieces and bad effects are also harmful (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car exploded in the end was clearly a model car ) and horrible dialogues and some really nasty female nudity don't help. And in the end he tries to get away with his inconsistency by saying that it was all the invention of the same old people telling tales of fire at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> So the killer really shows up in the last scene and tears them apart. Yet. <br /> <br /> Mediocre of its kind, good only for some unwanted laughter. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
