This waste of time is a completely useless remake of a great movie. Nothing new or original is added except for Perry's reverses, which are of marginal interest. The documentary atmosphere of the first film is lacking and the raw urgency that made it so effective. The sharp soundtrack of Quincy Jones is also painfully missing, adding a lot to the original film. I can't understand any high ratings for this. It's pretty ugly. Why does someone waste time or money sucking like this and why did I waste time looking at it?
