This is just one of those horrible movies that you find on Lifetime TV that portray the aberrant behavior of a disgusting woman in an empathic way. Along with other bad films like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster", this film takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why he is not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here is my question to the directors: if LeTourneau were a man and Vili was a 12 year old girl, would you have made a sympathetic and empathetic portrait with this person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine you change sex in this movie, and then you will see just because I and others here consider this a useless piece of junk. If the sexes had changed, there would have been no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we would probably be treated to a portrait of a horrible monstrous man who looted a girl, his lascivious behavior landed him in prison, and his brainwashing victim suffered from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is because of his sex. <br /> <br /> We call things by their name. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Clear and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She is a criminal who belongs to the prison and deserves our derision and our contempt, but certainly not our pity or empathy.
