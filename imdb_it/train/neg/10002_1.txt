Sorry to all, "I know this should be an" art "film, but wow, they would have to distribute guns at the screening so that people could blow their brains and not look. Although the scene design and photographic direction were excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. Loooonnnnng blows were too long. How long can you watch two people sitting there and talk? Especially when the dialogue is of two people they complain. I really had a hard time getting through this movie. The performances were excellent, but how many dark, gloomy, uninspired things can you take? The only thing I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and scene. "Dance. Otherwise it was a Bergman scam. And I'm not a fan of him either. I think anyone who claims to have enjoyed 1 and a half hours is, well, lying."
