this film was terrible I thought with all those decent actors, it would have been better. don't waste time Eva longoria parker was horrible. she should stick to desperate housewives. Paul Rudd is becoming an actor B. the mess he made in the film I could never be your woman was the epitome of what I'm saying. and the lake bell was pretty, but it definitely needed more acting lessons. look like heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... it was a little better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful that you did not waste your precious time. PS I love you is also good beyond the romantic tomb! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to people who have already seen it.
