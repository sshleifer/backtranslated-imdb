Please don't waste your time. This film rehashes the worst of Dracula by Bram Stoker (Van Helsing), Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice (rock music and silly biblical references), and Blade (high-tech toys). I really like vampire movies and novels, and there are many that are very good. But not this stinker. Not even the soundtrack is helpful, above all because the film uses scary and ridiculous classical music rather than the "absurd football" that some report. Only a few times I have heard of metal; mostly violins were tortured. Avoid it as garlic and crucifixes.
