I just took this film for a penny at the National Wholesale Liquidators, and after seeing it, I feel like I've been robbed. <br /> <br /> I don't know that I've seen a movie worse than this. Honestly. And I would never write a negative review of a film if I didn't have such enormous respect for the subject, namely Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> First, what is it? Is it a musical biography? Yes, many Foster songs have been interspersed here and there are these pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Kern numbers that echo more than the Mississippi Delta. I mean, did anyone pay to write this drivel? Secondly, Foster's true story is fascinating. Why don't you even come CLOSE to it? Third, what did they have on the great Ray Middleton to make him make this movie? Photos of him with small children ?? With the communists? What a waste of a great talent. <br /> <br /> So, friends of Foster, and the truth, and have fun, be afraid ... be very, very, frightened.
