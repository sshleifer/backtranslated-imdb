This film seems to be completely useless. There is no reason why everything that happens in it happens, as if it were written by a small child who is half bored and thought "how can I finish this?" And what were Jared Harris and Christopher Walken thinking? Did they do it for a bet? I couldn't tell you the plot, I'm not entirely sure there is one to be honest, but if it is there it hasn't been recorded. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs as she lashes out, like you. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl, they meet Christopher Walken who has unearthed an ancient woman preserved in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason but to continue the story and she shows her gratitude for having immediately frozen it. From that moment on, everything becomes a bit silly. A couple of hours of my life I'd like to come back to!
