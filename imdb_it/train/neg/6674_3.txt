I must admit that the draw for this film is director Eduardo Sanchez, who directed the famous and famous Blair Witch Project. Furthermore, this is an alien film, and resembled Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those films that critics hated, but I liked. <br /> <br /> But no, unfortunately I felt it for the most part, Altered is a waste of time, so I'll keep this brief review. The premises are always promising and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who had strange encounters when they were younger and, as usual, others will take you like crazy to imagine things. The stories about alien abduction always have to do with probes in orifices, so I won't go into details, but the drift is damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget. <br /> <br /> And if you're given a chance for revenge? I mean, you can successfully hunt down and catch one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a satisfactory repayment time, or so they thought. And it is here that the film begins to turn into a snoozefest mess, with bad dialogues, uninspiring and even worse. Even if the budget is low, there are not many positive factors, both for the strength of the plot and for the help of the cast in making their characters a little interesting. It is the classic cardboard fare taken from a script in white and vanilla combined with some low-cost scare tactics employed. <br /> <br /> What's good is the trick. Many efforts have been made to accomplish some of the things I will not mention, because that would only ruin the few elements of what makes this film tolerable. In addition to this, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and blood moments that have never been seen before. <br /> <br /> Look at this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in the city - Feast, this is less fun and takes itself too seriously. Bogged down by an uninteresting direction, you have been warned.
