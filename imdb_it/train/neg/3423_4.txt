This is a classic soft core puzzle from the 1970s in the genre Russ Meyer, although perhaps less bizarre than some of Meyer's works. This film has "production values" higher than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. However, the plot, writing and acting are directly in zone B. Lately, this film has become a mainstay of the B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the universe of the 500 channels. If the soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is "good" like any other in the B range. Don't expect Polanski, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles' performance as "mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the film's actors has become famous, and it's not surprising. The confessions of a young American housewife are far from the worst example of its kind. It's watchable, if that's your kind of movie. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant-garde and rickshaw movie. Today you can see more or less the same kind of thing about the Showtime / HBO series and prime time.
