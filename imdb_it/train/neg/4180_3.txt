I chose this film to replace the sad choice of daytime television and go with my thirst for femme fatale. Well, for the previous one, it's better than daytime television .... although I'm not sure how much. <br /> <br /> It has its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes, the good points jump out and we reach the conclusion that they are watching a TV movie that was put together with little time for do something that will be held together. In short, a terrible type of Sci Fi movie. <br /> <br /> It has its points as the future is dirty, as "Blade Runner" showed ..... obviously, this is not "Blade Runner" ". It looks like the Captain, a bit like l actor Robert Forster, the kind of person one would like to be around. <br /> <br /> But unfortunately it ends up feeling like an ugly "Andromeda" rehash where the muscle of the crew is made up of poor copies of machine guns clever of "Aliens", the mystic Willow is intensified sexually, and the new Captain could also be like Jan-Michael Vincent running on "Danger Island" in "Banana Splits", he only wore the uniform with shoulder pads, he has very little right to it, they all run with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks a lot like Eureka Maru while they are fighting a class of "people" who occupy the universe and are divided into different tribes or seven of different evolutionary qualities ....... just like the Nietzchians in "Andromeda". <br /> <br /> It could have a ransom function with Michael Ironside, but after a while, you get the feeling of having taken the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but the film doesn't help much. <br /> <br /> It's ..... "okay". It's fine in the way you could watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they look at it with advertisements, they will probably change the channel. One could look at it once .......... but a few hours later, you will be wondering what made them see everything. <br /> <br /> For me, that was the femme fatale. ............ when he was fighting.
