Until the end, the bad guys have the upper hand - always - the kind of questioning the competence of the good guys. A couple of plots by an innocent-accused of a crime are irritating. Some useless dialogue in which various boring legal issues are discussed. This is just a mediocre old western idiot, so what's the point of trying to keep things "realistic"? The atypical presence of Cagney in a western is one of the few - if not the only - funny thing about the movie. Somewhere in the middle there is a ridiculously timed marriage proposal; a bit like "Where is the Kid hiding ?? !! Where is he ?! ... Oh, and anyway, will you marry me?"
