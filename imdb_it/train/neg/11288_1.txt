Recently I have been subject to both this film and "King Arthur", on DVDs chosen by others for an "entertainment" of the evening and together they get nothing but a growing idea that I have the modern audience that totally misses the film of discrimination and is satisfied as long as they get "action". Both films were absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> Whatever happened to the character's development? Whatever happened to a meaningful dialogue? Whatever happened to ACTING? And, looking at something that vaguely claims to be "historic", whatever happened in trying to capture some accuracy, some realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of the time, even some slight taste of the age, especially in its aspects social attitudes. Why do they all have to show the set of values ​​of 21st century America? I read on the notice boards that "little was known" about the dark ages. Not like that. Considerable amounts are known, with much wisdom in the era, but these pranksters simply could not be bothered to do their homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could vote 0/10
