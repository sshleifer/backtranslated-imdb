Holy crap! What a terrible, terrible Spanish thriller! I had it for about four years and finally I started it the other night. I watched about an hour before going to bed. I was quite intrigued by the whole thing. I finished it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped it the night before. Literally, I stopped it the second before the film was completely downhill. As I said, I was rather intrigued and curious about where this mystery was going, but I stopped it just when Simon received the package in the bar. I picked up when he opened the package to reveal a laser gun and then played a "threatening" game of laser tags. Thank god! So the big revelation is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role-play nerds. Wow! It can be said that the Spanish industry was definitely behind the director Mateo Gil (co-author of the two great previous successes of Amenabar). There is an excellent score and excellent photography. But this scenario smells of stupidity. As anyone who has sat in the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.
