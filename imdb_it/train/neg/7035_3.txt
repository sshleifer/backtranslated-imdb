An extremely thin "plot" of satanic rituals or some of these mumbo-jumbo provides the excuse of a hockey to do a lot of sex scene scenes together. Direct vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S & M, bestiality, incest, and some other sexual proliferation all have their time in the spotlight here. The problem is that the plot is so boring that unbridled sexuality becomes rather boring after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate goat / girl encounter could be so damn boring? Well, now I do it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everything; Helga Line provides T & A (both on display quite frequently); women see the occasional penis. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D + <br /> <br /> Region 1 DVD Extras: trailer for "Pick Up", "Legend of Eight Samurai", "Do not Answer the phone", "Prime Evil "and" Sister Street Fighter "(the same DVD also contains a second feature film" Evil Eye ")
