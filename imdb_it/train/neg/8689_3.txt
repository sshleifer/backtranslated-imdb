The main problem of "Power" is that it also presents useless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the film. It gets boring after a while, sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that pushes the movie forward. You could probably pass it all as a character development, but all of them are recycled from the previous scenes in the film, or they are simply simple and uninteresting. Lumet never gives enough time to make some of the supporting casts bloom. He had to cut some of the characters (hackman, wife) and focus more on the others (Billings). It could have been a big, tough political thriller instead of a messy mess that loses every message in a sea of ​​bad writing and acting, a fact that amazed me considering the cast. Even the performance of Gene Hackman was not up to par. Denzel Washington is the only real note actor here. Gere and the others have performed much better elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet must return to the ferocious performances of a man who did in the seventies (ie Serpico) and stop trying to regain his success with "12 Angry Men" and "Fail Safe". Sidney didn't work yet, and most likely never will. leave the ensemble dramas in Altman. <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> * / * * * *
