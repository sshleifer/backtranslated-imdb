If there's one thing you can count on Disney, it's their extraordinary ability to make a story and tell it again and again and again. Even looking at the Lady and the Tramp II commercial was a horrible experience. Disney is about to ruin one of their greatest classics ever. He also had that scene of spaghetti balls. It has been done before! And that's what I say to this sorry direct video (the whole concept should be banned). Everything is just a remake of the original film and also many of Bluth's really bad movies. The penguin and walrus duo (I even forgot their names) are just a really poor carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. He also repeats practically all his old lines. The songs are pathetic, really abysmal. I've never heard such bad songs from them before. And the dialogue is atrocious. It's pathetic and simplistic. On the plus side, at least they took the time to make the animation a little decent. All the usual characters are not as annoying as before (or maybe it's a bad thing for the Mermaid fans). Returning to the negative, Melody is so incredibly cute she can vomit. I almost did it. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid a favor. Don't waste your money on this. True, it's not as horrible as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but this is a small consolation.
