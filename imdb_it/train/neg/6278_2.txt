You have to ask yourself why some films have been made ... this has decided to jump with the why among so many other things and it is around just beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> Yet you have a fair number of decent actors who do their best to give some life to the story. The blue tint throughout the film extends to "anchor", which alone would be depressing, but here it is excessive. The idea that it is not a medical condition, not a house curse or gypsy or trinket but only something that for no apparent reason begins to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her, ends up looking like a big gulp out of an empty cup. Some doppelgangers have super powers but others don't know or don't know what they do? They seem to be just as incapable of what we are. <br /> <br /> He is a trickster of "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers" of a poor man with "Mirror" and "The Sixth Sense" by Keifer Sutherland, you seriously break those three together.
