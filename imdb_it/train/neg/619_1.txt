WOW is all I can say if your reading is either looked at or you're thinking about it. Trust me to watch it! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard in so many parts of this movie that the worst acting ever made is so much fun! I can't believe they overlaid the school sign! I must have played that scene over and over again just to laugh more and more every time. If a film like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our films. even the costume was bad. it seemed that my 7-year-old cousin could have done a better job of making it. heck, I bet he could have written and behaved better. all i know is i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first one. it's a nice idea for a killer scarecrow but it would have been possible to do a much better job. let's hope another scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this.
