It is a belt to indulge such great actors in a film so weak and boring. In addition to all the unanswered questions published in the other comments, what's so hard about catching thieves? Just eliminate the bank employees, see who was in the bank, from the camera angles of all the cameras, before the entry of the thieves and you have the other 4 robbers left among the hostages. Where is the suspense that every body is talking about? It was so obvious when the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they would all walk out the front door ... they saw it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have topped the film with some good soundtracks and art shots. The film is not worth it. Ready!
