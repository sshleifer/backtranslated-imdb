I saw this movie at a "preview" and I honestly have to confess that I don't really like movies with Meryl Streep. This photo was the worst. Half of the theater did not return after the break in the middle of the film. I could not blame them, if this was not a true story there was absolutely no need for the second part of the image. Just before the film went on in time, about ten years, I myself expected the credits to appear.
