I actually liked this film to the end. Sure, it was poor and rather unlikely, but it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, this is. For his final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where he struggled to reach other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Surprise them with their grip and execution of this long-honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and slaves Carmen's great sensual Habanera and turns her into a forgettable Brittany Spears pop song. My ears were bleeding! And, at the supreme moment of horror, her teachers made her a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not a fantasy induced by Spears would have disappointed her on the spot. Save time, save your ears - skip this movie!
