Seeing this movie, as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic (which lists it as "Dangerous Female"), can only multiply your appreciation for the Bogart-Astor version of 1941. Ricardo Cortez had to be paid for the grin. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. Women are all good, but not better than that. Well, A Merkel is a little better. More interesting are the "originals" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who competently distribute many of the individual tics, but almost none of the changing atmospheres of their successors in roles, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential seed of their characters in the remake; here, Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) can't. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't exactly smell; it lies there like a big slice of ham. Its main value today recalls that great films like the '41 Falcon "don't just occur. On a scale of 1 to 10, I value a 4, mainly for camera work and support players.
