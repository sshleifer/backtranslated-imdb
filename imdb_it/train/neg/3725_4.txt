This is an interesting treatment of a rather controversial topic (read the other comments on this film). Apparently, you love or hate it and it seems that most people make that distinction based on the fact that they believe that the tribulation and timing of the end will occur as described in the film. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film - and its sequel - were made for around $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are right down there with "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and the acting is on the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my apologies to Ed Wood). Setting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as it comes. Also add the slightest thought that the story might be close to something that could happen in the future and get even scarier. <br /> <br /> This film, and its sequels, did not attempt to bring reasons why the tribulation occurred when it happened. "Left Behind" and "The Omega Code" have tried to get into all that "Thief" has done and to explain all the politics and maneuvers in the Middle East that preceded us. The net effect was that "Thief" did a much better job in the scary part of the film, instead of spreading too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie, its sequels, for what they are: horror stories. That horror stories can be told indirectly by God only makes them much more frightening. If it makes you think about the subject, he did his job - even if you never believe it.
