It is very unfortunate when a film like this is produced. Much of the work and money has been included in a film that is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The editing drags on, there are obvious errors that could have been easily corrected in a second shot and the soundtrack is devoid of imagination. Much more could have been done with this video. I guess they have run out of time, or the videotape. <br /> <br /> Hand shots have a distinct amateur feel.
