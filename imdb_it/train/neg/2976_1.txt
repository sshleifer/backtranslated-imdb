Miraculously, this is actually quite watchable. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But while the original was so bad-is-ruined-my-bad life, this is so-bad-is-badly funny. Right, it's pretty praise. The production values ​​are marked across the board, the recitation is heartbreaking and the satire Romero-wannabe cannot decide which side of the fence of ecology is playing. The internal logic takes second place to the heads that push themselves out of the refrigerators, the incubation times of the viruses that float as required by the "plot", the bullets that work against the zombies or not, the zombies that have the power to speak or less. Gore is the draw, of course, but the structure is so disgusting that it's annoying. The dialogue sounds as if it had been translated by the same computers that manipulate the instruction manuals, and the scale of the zombie infestation is not implicit in the ingenuity of Romero's films. It's all complemented by a horrendous synth score. Absolute garbage.
