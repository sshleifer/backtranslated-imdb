This film reminds me of a movie by Mary-Kate and Ashley, only worse. Only the rich sisters think that even though Alysons is more an actress, in this film Amanda michalka was sometimes fine, but Alysons behaved badly. I think that after the high school musical they should come up with something better and this certainly wasn't. The plot wasn't great and I think they should have had two more people to play Taylor and Courtney. I'm not a big fan of Alyson Michalka and this movie didn't please me anymore. I think they should definitely be sick of singing and just watching this movie if you have nothing better to do (which unfortunately I don't have)
