Good good good. As for John Carpenter's first season in "Masters of Horror", this is the exact opposite. He certainly proved to be still a horror master with "Cigarette Burns", but "Pro-Life" is perhaps the worst I've ever seen from him. <br /> <br /> It is stupid, totally devoid of a disturbing atmosphere and tension and is above its welcome, despite the execution time of less than an hour. The script is meaningless, the characters are irritable and unattractive and the conclusion is beyond the absurd. <br /> <br /> And for those fanatics who actually bought the DVD (one of them is me); did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He's really proud of it and talks about it as his best work for a long time, and praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious failure that reached the final cut, he simply says that he didn't consider it essential to correct the error and simply let it be there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope to be denied. <br /> <br /> I want to leave a positive note and say that the effects of the creature are fantastic, though. Technically speaking, this film is first-rate, with effective lighting schemes and make-up effects.
