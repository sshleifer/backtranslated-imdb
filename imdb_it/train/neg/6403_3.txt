.... regarding the level of intelligence on which this play operates. Barely reaching the length of the feature film, "Can I do it ...? Until I need glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THIS had to be the final line (example: Santa's gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize you've needed so much time to set up THIS line (for example: the student gag). And almost everyone is headed without any artistic talent. Don't get me wrong: about 1 line out of 10 actually manages to be fun (the iron / phone is probably my favorite). There is also a wonderful full frontal nudity that shows, once again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is also some comic male nudity). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid song is really damn appealing! But none of these reasons is enough to give this film anything more than * in 4.
