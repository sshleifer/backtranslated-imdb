Let's just say it in simple words, so that even the creators of this film could have a chance to understand: this is a very stupid film with an even more stupid script, a limping animation and a story that is as original as the thumbtacks . Don't worry if you don't need to find a way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They might laugh, especially if they are out of their medication. There is a special kind of insult in a film so ridiculous - not only do the filmmakers think that children are mindless idiots who can be entertained with a touch of voice that costs around zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat by inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. This film, frankly, made me literally bewildered. Shame on you for lowering yourself so low.
