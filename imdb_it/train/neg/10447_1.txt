I chose to see this film because it got a good score here on IMDb. But many people have a really bad taste or someone has adjusted the score. <br /> <br /> In both cases it was a real disappointment. The film is exactly stupid and unlikely as the title suggests. There really is no reason to summarize the plot - but here it goes: it seemed that someone had thought, "Wouldn't it be nice to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for a while the reason would you go crazy and start biting and stuff?!? "And that's all! The plot is thin and not original. Snakes are bad CGIs (but it makes sense to cut the corners of a movie that no one in their right mind will recommend to anyone!). The acting is poor, and all people are incredible stereo types. <br /> <br /> To sum up: it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - stay away!
