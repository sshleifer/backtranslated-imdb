I'm not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such enthusiastic reviews. <br /> <br /> Watching "Bang" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the random and meaningless plot that was happening on the screen. The entire film seems to be nothing more than an exercise in the director's insignificant, artistic and farcical self-indulgence. The fact that the director / writer follows a moniker name only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Those interested in independent films would be better off looking for something better written and, I would say, more fun than this complete waste of time.
