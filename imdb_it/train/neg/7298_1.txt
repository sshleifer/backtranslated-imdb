no saving qualities can be expressed. I wish I could take my time back. The beautiful skull face has a broad smile, brilliant to the camera when the disease has already devastated the ill-informed script enough. I was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the characters dead or seriously incapacitated in the end, especially the party snipers who drink the contaminated juice as they make their way to the supposed sunset. Eli Roth shines for the moments of maybe ten, putting out the theory about how the grass smokes well in the woods when others are raging about beer consumption. overall, I found the most useless, though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the disappearance of the cast, in a sense, wishing that the trip had never happened (I probably should have had a fuck instead to look late TBS night, ugh).
