This film is told through the eyes of a young teacher in a Catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide wraps around it. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of Rawanda's past history and rivalry. Then jump to the story told through the eyes of a young idealist "NEW-COMER", a young teacher who does not take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a roadblock, he plays with his drivers. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver fails to identify himself as belonging to the right tribe for soldiers, he will be killed. And this is how he treats the story of the chaos that is unfolding and develops around him. Suddenly he realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that European soldiers and tourists cannot and do not want to help. Media cameras cannot stop the machete and there are too many gunmen tinkering with the militia. the title comes from the army captain who says he is going to shoot the dogs that eat the corpses around his fence, but he will not shoot the militia men who are killing people around the complex. Especially since they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the desperation of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up the place for one of the foreseen victims, flees with his tail between his legs, rather than face the immanent death with the school children has promised don't leave me behind. <br /> <br /> It is more about character study, and a time when Jesus came for a character, rather than a story about genocide in "RAWANDA". This film should not have taken place in RAWANDA, any of the holes in Genocide's hell that revolved around this world could have taken place at any given time.
