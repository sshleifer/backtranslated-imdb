Imitating his long title, the film finds a way to approach the brand of the 90s. The splendid sets are here with everything that made Hamer's production a trademark, yet Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words, so there is nothing unexpected and nothing is worth more than 5% of your attention. <br /> <br /> The direction is heavy as a direct transfer from the role play, the actors are mostly rigid like wax figures (ok this is a function of Hamer, only sometimes it is better described in the whole package). My conclusion: this film is rubbish, not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring thing and I should have hoped that the guys in charge of programming at Cinematheca would know better.
