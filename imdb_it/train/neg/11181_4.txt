The film is about two stories: one is a political murder of a girl called, the other a political class of an upper class. The crossing point is the public relations character played by Al Paccino, as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening. <br /> <br /> If the script is terrible without decent dialogues and the directionless void of any sense of drama, the representation of Al is memorable: how many companions can be as convincing as a powerful and feared man (like Godfather ") as here a little servant (see also" Donnie Brasco "). <br /> <br /> In reality, the great young lion has become a tired old man. This passing of the centuries is very moving, because it makes the public reflect on the fact of getting too old. <br /> <br /> But its slowness is just a trick because it can recover its energy in the Church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's a good thing that the film is so terrible because it puts the starlight on Al's talent!
