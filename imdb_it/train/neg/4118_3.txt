While browsing the channel, we found this film with its promising synopsis. We were dismayed by the flat acting and the formulaic plot. We found the explosion of car scenes, incredible shootings, and the scenes that hit with the weight of foam rubber and cardboard funny. What was even more fun was seeing all the recycled scenes from "Dante's Peak", where the front of the church falls on the school bus, the fronts of the shop come off the main road, the flyover collapses, and the red truck whizzes along the alley as the bricks fall on it. It was a good laugh, even if not intentional, and leaves the viewer to wonder if it was not originally intended as a parody of low budget catastrophic films.
