Who could ever sympathize with these two hateful protagonists? What is meant to be a light and bubbly comedy about neighborhood children who cannot give up their child's gambling, even as they age to adulthood, stands out more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence. As children, the couple is unbearably early; as adults they are intolerably immature. It's a bad combination.
