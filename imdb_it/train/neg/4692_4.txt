When I first saw this film, it was called TERROR ON A TRAIN and it was the back half of a double movie. Glenn Ford, an arms expert, is called to defuse a hidden bomb on a train loaded with explosives. The tension is slow and constant; and this black and white film only lasts an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on TV; the tension and drama have lost most of its impact. This is still a good movie until the early 1950s. <br /> <br /> Together with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
