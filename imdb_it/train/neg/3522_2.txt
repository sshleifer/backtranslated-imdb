If you like the standard Sly gestures that involve action at the top, incredible stunts (it's unthinkable that it's unbelievable here), and delayed dialogues; you'll love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone would have been forced into his "not to be missed" days to give in to smarter people and make an action movie that would put a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, the setting and the action (credible) would have prevailed. I want an action that is close enough to reality to be able to imagine the fear and excitement that could derive from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects made at least one scene ridiculous. Judge Dredd is better just because you know that when you enter the theater you will see a comic strip made in a movie. The character, the setting and everything else have no comparison with anything we could meet ourselves. Cliffhanger instead turns a mountain guide into Rambo before you can say "yo, Adrian!"
