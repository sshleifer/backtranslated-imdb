.. THIS IS ONE! Very nice premise, immediately out of your mind. <br /> <br /> It has an excellent first scene, I have to give credit to those who are due. <br /> <br /> It has solid characters and a pretty decent script for a ghost story but here are the things that bothered me: whenever the ghosts appeared, which I really liked; how it was done, as it seemed ... the only thing was the ghost's relationship. Because of the way things went down in the first scene, you'd think their dynamics would have been different. <br /> <br /> Things slowed a little too much in the middle that I felt, and the crab / spider scene was just not good. BUT then the ending is actually very good! Of course, "The Grudge" basically told the same story with a shiny lens but no samurai and that's what I liked about this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, someone with a temperate style remake this movie. /> <br /> Silent Rage fans would love this movie.
