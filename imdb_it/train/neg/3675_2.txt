Really, everyone in this movie seems to want to be somewhere else! No wonder, the casting is not done with the left hand, but rather not entirely. I have not seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone who impersonates a sort of agent, carrying a gun. You don't use a bad city look in this role. The only thing worse than I can imagine is choosing Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is equally terrible, perhaps with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him try, but suffer. Oh, did I say it's a completely crazy story? Jeopardizing many people's lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, must it be because the boy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10, because photography could be worse.
