Spoiler. <br /> <br /> First of all, nothing happened in this film, except for one woman who bleeds inexplicably. Second, it wasn't scary. Third, he had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. Has the sound been changed by Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure, so let's go with Beavis. The film gradually becomes quieter and people grumble and murmur, forcing you to turn up the volume (I saw it at home). So Beavis detonates very noisy sounds with seemingly scary / shocking images, forcing you to quickly turn down the volume. This occurs many times until, fortunately, the film ends. I can imagine Beavis laughing roughly from behind the two-way mirror as I watched the test group frantically searching for the remote control every time. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it's a big mistake anyway. Here's a thought ?? if you're about to make a horror movie, at least add a free beheading, a blonde 19-year-old girl screaming at the top of her lungs before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on someone's wall being eaten alive just out of reach of the camera , a cat thrown at the camera to scare the audience, a strange weirdo with a manic laugh, or a monster that looks like a stage hand covered with aluminum foil (a TV of Lost in Space). These people haven't even tried to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
