2 stars, and I'm generous. (minor spoiler) Look, this is a low-budget zombie movie set in the Oakland gangland. As the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by. <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film: what zombies?! All the "zombies" growl (which doesn't even seem remotely frightening) and fake red blood dripping from their mouths! No scary eyes, no rotting flesh, just a bunch of people who growl in a pathetic way and run like idiots. <br /> <br /> The cover is also misleading. There are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not as if the whole "bonnet" was plagued by zombies or something else, they are just a few, and it's contained in a short time. <br /> <br /> Actually acting is so bad that it's fun. No one can act in this film (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really looks like a group of friends got together, decided to form their family and made a movie one weekend. <br /> <br /> Final note: since when do doctors wear sports suits?! Skip this, please!
