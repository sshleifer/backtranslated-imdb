A black guy fights ..... and presumably wins .... yes ... 1/10. Obviously the fiction. <br /> <br /> So we are presented with a damm nice title, a real tag line and also a nice storyline. That's it, it's over ... Let's move on to fiction after that. <br /> <br /> Michael Jai White, the black guy, so don't get confused with the name .. he portrays a black guy .. Umm, that's all there is to the name .. <br /> <br /> It is so difficult to find decent help, he must have hired black friends to help cause the low budget, low inadequacy of this film, he has the shadow of the camera that drags the first scenes ... idiot for the average guy like you and me .. but yes ... <br /> <br /> 10 lines. review posted,. if you paid to watch this movie, you got screwed.
