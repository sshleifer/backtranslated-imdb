OK ..... This is the third in the carnosaur series. Let's throw stars with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the movie you can't see Dino's cause when the body count starts, you can only see Dino's vision of the eyes, clever enough to hide the bad puppets! and maybe in 16 minutes on the film a special force group with Scott Valentine as leader Rance, the team enters the warehouse and then they start to find body parts and bodies after Dino's fury, after a while a big box arrives failing in the team and feeling a velociraptor scream, rather terrifying !!! and then a black girl walks forward and now there is a blooper! He opens a raptor hand and cuts his face, but if you stop when the raptor's hand comes you can see that he's just a boy with a puppet !? WTF! The story is simple. 1. Some terrorists attack a truck because, according to them, they wash some weapons. 2. Where he died badly, he seems to be a ten-ton raptor and a giant t-Rex in there! How did t-Rex fit ??? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs! Unfortunately a stupid blonde girl told him to capture one alive = 4. The jesus saints have birds of prey on their deeds! 5. Dino's is now on a boat in the Pacific 6: Strange I didn't know that t-Rex had a strange thing around its neck ??? 7. THE END. The movie is nice if you want a good laugh.
