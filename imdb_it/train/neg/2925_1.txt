After reading several good reviews and hearing good things through word of mouth, I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say that I was rather disappointed. The story has been difficult to follow because the film is set up as a series of flashbacks between the present and the recent past that are poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors' best efforts, are flat and uninteresting. Sex and nudity are more explicit than they should be. I've never seen a movie in which they seemed so useless to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many questions unanswered to a plot that has not been well explained to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.
