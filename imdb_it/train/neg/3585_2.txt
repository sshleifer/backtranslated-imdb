Being a big fan of gorilla films in general, I anticipated that this would be great - and as for the gorilla effects, they were still pretty good - that's the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story but, in fact, it doesn't even come close to what really happened to "Buddy" - which in real life was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal lovers as a woman who hardly had the welfare of animals in the best interest. As much as Buddy was portrayed as aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla in real life resort to such behavior. in fact, his friend avoided his wooden case (not a luxurious cage room depicted in the film) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which scared Gertrude Lintz into selling it. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in a garage for some time with only a light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown at him until his death (historically the oldest living gorilla ever recorded, by the way) before a show in Miami. Also note, in the film, how Buddy gets older, but chimpanzees never grow old. (Chimpanzees, by the way, were not bred simultaneously with other animals, including Buddy, as portrayed in the film)
