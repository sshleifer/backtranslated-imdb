The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that really scared me. The acting was not bad, and the killer "Cupid" was credible and disturbing. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The plot and the plot of this movie are incredibly weak. There wasn't much to do. The way the killer killed his victims was very terrifying and disgusting. I don't recommend this movie to anyone who can't handle the gore. <br /> <br /> In general: a good scare, but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** on *****
