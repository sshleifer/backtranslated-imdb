The wicker man has done the impossible! He replaced Cat Woman as the worst recent movie in my mind from the steel trap cinema. Yes, it's really so bad. So bad that when I sat down to write this review, I thought to myself, "If I had the chance to see this movie again or have glowing needles pushed into my eyes, I could really look for the hot needles. . <Br /> <br /> Neil LaBute has created a rare film in which Joel Schumacher could sit and say with comfort and without guilt "Yes, it's bad direction right there". <br /> <br /> I think it's the first clue to myself that should have been the demarcation line: "Some sacrifices must be made". Of course, it might seem like a brazen and threatening line to intrigue you, but the sacrifice will be all on the audience side of the screen. Trust me, the people responsible for this film should be accused of a hate crime ... or at least of a fraud for trying to pass this off as something like entertainment. Seriously! The film is about an island where men are there for breeding and I would rather stay stuck on Gilligans Island just with photos of Condoleezza Rice and then find myself stranded. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie was the guy who ripped the noisiest fart I've ever heard in a movie theater. It is neither a joke nor an imaginary one. I've never been in a "thriller" and heard so many laughs throughout the movie. I can't tell you for sure if the laughter was intentional in any way to lighten the cinematic tension or if they really thought that this crude would actually fly. Honestly I found myself doing routing for a power outage or maybe a fight to go out to the cinema, all to make it more interesting, which is pretty sad since Deez, Powder and I beat 2 beers before the movie alone for a bit of anesthesia (soon a law before all of Nic Cage's films, write to your deputy today, do not delay). At one point I really thought that maybe this movie is really a parody and Anna Ferris will show up ?? oh how I wish. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage throws out so much ham per frame that I'm thinking of taking a cholesterol test done today. To think I ever thought that Sean Penn was a d * ck for slamming Nic's, oh it's still a d * ck of just under one ... yes D * ck by Sean Penn has been diminished due to this film. Do everyone a favor, Nic, play your strengths and stick to the pathetic losers and drunkards. You can't play superman you can't play strong hunky roles, go straight to jail, don't pass, don't collect $ 200. His best moments in this film are when he is finally unhinged and in reality he beats a portly woman to steal his bear costume (like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run like that of Conan O'Brian Mammoth bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear who knocks on his stuff. Fortunately, he meets his end shortly after he discovers that it will be a sacrifice for the crowd on the new hybrid tour of Burning Man and Lilith Fair. Yup!!!! I ruined the ending for you and if you knew something better, you would build statues of me to worship and sing songs of my legend. I sat in this shitty shit so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> Halfway through this little mishap I kept thinking that Jack Bauer would have wrapped this case in 20 minutes of real time. .OK 35 minutes if Kim is first attacked by a mountain lion. Even Steve Martin, like Inspector Clouseau, could have understood it in less than an hour ?? and you are not a Clouseau inspector. <br /> <br /> If for some reason you are taken prisoner and you have the chance to watch this movie or take a bullet, take the bullet. <br /> <br /> Somewhere Uwe Boll is laughing at us all.
