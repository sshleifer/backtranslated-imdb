The Van is a funny movie about a guy trying to lure the girls into his new van, to seduce them. The only thing that this film does not fail is the depiction of the van fad in the United States in the late 1970s. It seems to have been made entirely by amateurs. It's rubbish, but I loved it! I have to admit I'm a 70s trash fan! I hope this gets to the number 100 of IMDB! <br /> <br /> 2
