Depending on your personal mood when you watch this, "Christmas Evil" can turn out to be an ambitious and innovative psychological thriller OR one of the most pathetic and furiously fierce holiday themed coupons ever made. I, personally, am tempted to opt for the latter because I have not bothered to do any research and I simply anticipated a slasher of the early '80s mischievous and undemanding with a madman in a costume of Santa Claus who slaughtered people . Mistaken! The film actually deals with a boy named Harry Stadling; who is obsessed with Christmas, works in a garbage factory and believes that it is his responsibility to determine on Christmas Eve who deserves gifts and who deserves punishment. Harry's problems all started when he saw Santa Claus? his dad in a costume of course ?? caress the bare legs of his mother at an early age. After that it has just turned into a social outcast, to great irritation for the younger brother, who is forced to take a (holi) day. I understand perfectly why some fans appreciate this eccentric horror movie, but it had to be really boring? There are several too long and seemingly endless parts of the film in which absolutely nothing happens. I can forgive the lack of blood and the bloody scandal, but this film doesn't even benefit from a disturbing atmosphere or unexpectedly demented twists (with the notable exception of the finale, I must admit). Furthermore, I would have taken the concept more seriously if the mad protagonist had focused on the lethal punishment of bad children! It does not kill exclusively and abnormally. How should you take the controversial and original Christmas thriller seriously when Santa doesn't even commit a miserable child murder? This would have made "Christmas Evil" a classic, while now it's just a forgettable and pitiful piece of junk.
