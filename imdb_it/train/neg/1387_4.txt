It's hard to believe that a Jet Li "action" movie could be so boring, but this was transcendent rubbish. The plot is an amalgamation of other Hong Kong chopsocky films. Martial arts action is all special effects and no human talent. <br /> <br /> It is a story of comics about a group of super-human soldiers who must be killed because they are mentally unstable, one of them (Li) holding an incompetent army to save them and rebuilding a life as an anti-war librarian . Saved assassins re-emerge with a quality plot of Austin Powers to conquer the world, and he throws his new life to save the world. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed, and it could have accentuated the very thin plot and the special effects from 25 cents to the comic. But I suspect that even the eight years of Ninja-Turtle would have found this youthful and empty.
