I tried to appreciate this movie, really. In looking at him, all I can think of is, "This guy gives me the creeps, I would get a restraining order." It also calls up CODEPENDENCE in capital letters. Was this really the conversation before shooting the movie? "We make a film that puts two socially depressed and chronically depressed people in a relationship that deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are!" From what I've seen in life, the last thing on earth that we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self-pity. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film is clearly 80-ish; thoughtful and slow. Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments, only very few.
