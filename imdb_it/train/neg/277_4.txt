Lillian Hellman's comedy, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman, becomes a curious project of exit from the spirited Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, taking up the role of Broadway and winning the Oscar for best actor, plays an underground anti-Nazi leader German fighting the fascists, dragging his American wife and three children across Europe before finding refuge in the United States (across the border with Mexico). They settle in Washington with the rich mother and the wife's brother, although a boarder who resides in the manor is immediately suspicious of the new arrivals and spends a lot of time at the German embassy playing poker. It seems that it will always take for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest and direct refugees who teach clueless and unscrupulous Americans how the world has suddenly changed) , seems a bit patronizing - the viewer is literally put in the place of relatives, to whom a speech is given. Lukas has several speeches in the third act that have undoubtedly won the Oscar, but for most of the film he seems to do little, but he comes and goes, enters and leaves. Like his wife, Bette Davis says like no one else and works with her eyes wide open, but the role doesn't leave her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) Are alternately humorous and irritating, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has no role as a rotten wife (and the unfulfilled plot that leads to the part seems completely wrong). The intent here was to show us tactfully, tactfully, just because a man (from the second era of World War II) could be German, which does not make him a Nazi sympathizer. We take it in the first minutes; the rest of this tasteful and tactful film consists of exposure, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a heady mix, but instead it is rather dry and inert. ** from ****
