Anyone who thought that another single home movie would have been a good idea should have his head examined ... Same plot, different guy, more criminals (leading to infinite stupidity in traps). The other two films were pretty bad, and that's where it's at the bottom. People can also watch other films for the plot, as it is all identical.
