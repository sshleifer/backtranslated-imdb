Another extremely unprofessional film on computer programmers. <br /> <br /> The authors of that film do not know the true specificity of the world of programmers. <br /> <br /> 20 best programmers in the world, program that you have your satellites (for what?), program that uses freq., someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and many other stupid moments in this film. <br /> <br /> Peoples who do not programmers will not see something terrible in that movie, because there are no professionals on this. But people will see things that are not real. <br /> <br /> Programmers will find that film strange and terrible - because many moments in the film are not RELATED real life (why not film in this case?).
