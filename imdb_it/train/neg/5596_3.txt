A group of models is looking for an apartment to live in, and one is shown by a local real estate agent. Unknown to models and the agent, however, it is that "the threshold of hell" is in the apartment and when it is crossed, the demon "Dethman" is called to kill all those he meets on his way. The story is told by Sam Bishop, a journalist who was accused of the murders. Although I am a supporter of low budget, microbudget and independent films, I cannot praise this film. The creators are proud of their 24-hour filming program and at least one actor boasts on the DVD of his acting skills, but I can't understand him. Why would making a film in 24 hours if a last or two hours of editing would make the difference? And why do you pride yourself on acting that is poor, meaningless and results in the bad delivery of a handful of lines? <br /> <br /> Through much of the film, the models are shown parts of an apartment from an estate agent. The dialogue is clearly publicized because no screenwriter can invent an empty diction. The agent also knows nothing about lodging ... he focuses on aspects of a house that no one could care about, he explains the heat source incorrectly (didn't he see the radiator?) And he says the problem of pests will solved when they call "the terminator". Please write a script - some detours are fine, but this was a disaster. <br /> <br /> And why did the girls move in the models? Their careers made no sense in the plot, and this seems like a forced situation. At one point, an actress breaks the character and says something to the effect of "friend, it will be (upset)" that sounded more natural than any other line, even if out of place due to other bad dialogue. /> <br /> The demon made no sense. I appreciated the attempt to explain how "the threshold of hell" jumps into random places on Earth (including the apartment's chimneys), but why not explain where the demon comes from? His background involves a man whose love is killed by another man. How does it make you a demon? (Besides, why do we need all of these Victorian flashbacks without dialogue and looks through a field? It was exaggerated.) <br /> <br /> The dramatic pauses between the lines were horrible. The character of Sam Bishop was by far the worst, with the interviewer not far behind. Does each question require a pause, a funny face and an answer ... followed by a pause, a funny face and an answer? I was so frustrated. For me, the only point was to drag the time ... but I would rather have thirty minutes of good delivery than a horrible delivery hour (and therefore more time is wasted by scrolling the same credits twice). <Br /> <br /> Who was the character of Sam Bishop, anyway? Presumably he "saw" all this and was accused of killing the girls, but at no time was he ever in the part of the story with the girls. So how did you see them? And if he didn't, how did he know Dethman had killed them? And if you don't see Dethman, how do you know Dethman is the spirit of Apostoles? I was so lost ... was there also a pattern for a plot when this was written? <br /> <br /> The only part I found funny in this film was a scene with one of the models in the bathroom. Not that it was really important or anything, but it was the only break from the boredom I was given. I wonder what director Felix Diaz was thinking. His music is very good (see the DVD behind the scenes for his improvised way of playing), but I wonder about his ability to make films. Although the best part of the DVD was by far the trailer for his "Superhero Excelsior" (the trailer alone was better than this entire waste of time). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so hard. I would like to think that this film was a test of what can be done in 24 hours or maybe just an experiment for fun and the idea was never to make a quality film. But if "Superhero Excelsior" is an indication, Diaz can make quality ... so why did you choose to avoid it here? Perhaps the world will never know.
