Of all the films I have seen, this is almost true (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble and some others prevent it from reaching the bottom.) It is hasty, the plot is shaky and the events represented are badly done. Of course, we have to put some at the writer's door. The book that the film was filmed is outrageously ponderous and illogical. Oprah looks good on "Bigger's" mother, but it is almost at her potential. Other famous artists also seem to be at their worst. The plot that revolves around an African American who has decided to take a job as a driver. In leading the family daughter to a communist dinner, he learns. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against blacks, but he thinks so. So when she comes home she puts her to bed, but she starts complaining. The blind mother (yes) feels it, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead he suffocates her. Now fearing to be really in trouble for killing a white girl, he does what any thinking logical man would do - he pushes her into the coal furnace. So the investigators are carrying out a missing person case and checking the furnace (the idiot has not had the foresight to get rid of the ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are heinous segments of the court. Desperate for research of a bad movie, this could do the job, but if you really want to learn about cultural problems in the 40s and 50s or see good drama, there are many better options.
