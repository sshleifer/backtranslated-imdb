There seems to be little on the middle ground in which Watch On the Rhine is interested. Some like it very much, applauding his sincerity, his liberal point of view and his fine acting, or he hates his obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cartoon characters and general tendency. I fall into the second category a lot, and I found the film and the game, - concerning the activities of European refugees in Washington during the war - an overwhelming boredom, worth it especially for acting, and even then only intermittently. The author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. His plays were written for people who shared his point of view, and rarely explored ideas that had not already been held by the author and the public except to emphasize how terrible "the other side" was. Even when I'm in one hundred percent agreement with what he has to say, like in the Rhine, I still can't stand the way he says it. His characters are unreal, and while his ear for dialogue shows a certain ease for the way people talk, he does not possess a true brilliance or originality. He really had nothing new to say. I completely agree with Mary McCarthy's decommissioning of Hellman's reputation a few years ago. For those who think that the theater is dead or in extremis and craves the good old days, I urge you to take a peek at Watch On the Rhine, as bad as Angels In America, which only shows that the theater had one foot in the grave sixty years does.
