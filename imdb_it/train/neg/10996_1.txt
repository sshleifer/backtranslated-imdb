The movie Underground Comedy is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it would have been bad when the box had written the phrase "guaranteed to hurt" ... which meant that the directors would focus more on carving about you than making you laugh. <br /> <This film is an amateur plot of childish scenes, bad characters and worst jokes ... from the pathetic sketch of Bat-Man to the painful brazen Arnold Shvollenpecker, they are not funny at all. The few skits that are a bit funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but they too go on too long and are ruined by the ineptness of Vince Offer in the play. <br /> <br /> Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground ... bury it!
