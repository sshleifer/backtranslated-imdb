I had seen "The Eye" before seeing this. I really liked "The eye", it was one of the best films of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I chose this "haunted Bangkok" because it was the same director, and it was a bit popular around here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Haunted Bangkok" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. Which are not scary at all, not even disturbing (like "The eye" was) ... nothing at all. I can't even fill the 10 lines required for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
