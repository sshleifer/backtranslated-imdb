Don't waste time with this dreck. As interpreted, the characters have no ransom values ​​and watching them interact is pure torture. "Gothic" was at least entertainment, this is shit. If you like to look at the pretentious and spoiled poets who try to deceive one another, this could be your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete asshole, and because the others would have chosen to spend more than five minutes with him it is really disconcerting. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any spine, but she also comes out of the whole ordeal without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember having seen another top movie based on the same subject, but did not take the title. I was hoping it was like that, but I didn't have much luck. Not recommended.
