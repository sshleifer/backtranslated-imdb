I saw this movie last month as a free preview and I went out. It was pretty awful. Trying too hard, they played and made a horrible movie. I've been disappointed since I heard that all the actors had made respectable choices in the past, so this couldn't be so far from the brand - but, I was wrong. I was hoping that they would distribute a poll at the end of the film so we could tell them not to publish this movie. I was attracted by the free appearance of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time and, usually, I enjoy it very easily. He tried to be innovative and creative with shots, ideas and filming, but since they threw together so many ideas at the same time, he failed. I'm usually not fussy about movies and I don't usually feel the need to show my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch them. I registered on IMDb just to tell all of you guys
