Mae Clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face James Cagney showed a grapefruit in the same year THE PUBLIC ENEMY. She will not be remembered for this strange little story about a hooded girl who discovers that her past will always be with her. <br /> <br /> In a sense, this seems a little old-fashioned for 1931, almost as if you were looking at the famous inert lights of 1928 in New York. But don't be fooled. Although Ted Tetzlaff's photography is still in the big scenes, there is a lot of movement, which indicates distraction for viewers in set-ups. But in competition with the frantic stuff that everyone seems to be doing at Warner's, this attempt to bring the woman's point of view into the genre like a tear gas doesn't work, nor is the actress Mae Clarke carrying on the effort.
