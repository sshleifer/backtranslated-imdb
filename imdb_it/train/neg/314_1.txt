I took this movie for $ 5 dollars in a discount store, Adam Sandler is a fantastic actor and I thought it would be a good movie, well, it wasn't. There was absolutely no plot, bad jokes, and the other comedian said "The F-Word" every other word he said, usually cursing didn't bother me, but this was exaggerated. And even worse than the lack of plot was the part where Sandler started talking in the camera to random parts of the film, reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turned and looked at the screen and asked questions. And finally, it's the time to randomly insert photos of girls in bikinis at random into the movie. In my opinion, not buying this film is a waste of money
