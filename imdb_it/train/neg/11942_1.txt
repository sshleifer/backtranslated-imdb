Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts badly and deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is sadly pissed off in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo struggles manly with what is essentially a cartoon character. The only member of the cast with a little enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who considers him a villain and goes completely out of his role. The script is terrible, the acting is horrible and has a plot big enough to ride a double-decker bus! It's also the most sexist film I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unpleasant. She is considered a seductive seductive evil that attracts the poor, innocent married man to betray his wife. It is implicit in the whole film that she is a minor, and the message accompanying that plot is just a beggar's belief! In the end, he is not even able to redeem himself by shooting at the man who is obviously (ah!). He became demented with anger and guilt, but the script allowed him to kill himself, redeeming himself in the eyes of all the males. Horrible. Do not waste time.
