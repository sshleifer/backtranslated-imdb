I thought myself quite melancholy, especially when I watched a moving and tear-jerky film. But not for that (which surprised me!) And it also surprises me a lot to see how many people have praised this movie so much. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts in all the films: 1. Despite the guilt-reduced sense of Ben's true intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to encourage this kind of suicidal action. Some people might perceive that this is a heroic action and others think that it acts like a coward, in the end this was a disturbing action for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot of the film is too dramatized, but the logic is too simplified. From the medical point of view, correspondence of the blood group is required to be an organ donor. Towards the end of the film we learned that Emily had a posterior blood group that limited her chances of getting the donor within a short period of time. However, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, the same as his that allowed him to be his donor and, conveniently, despite the rarity of Ben's blood type, he was able to donate not only his heart but also his kidney, its cornea and its bone marrow which in all cases requires not only the corresponding blood but also the tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why do doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the jellyfish poison he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I could exaggerate in analyzing the whole story as after all this is just a movie. However, some of the disturbing facts outlined above will hopefully help you reconsider your plan to go see this movie. If you go for a soap opera movie, do it. But you go in search of intelligent entertainment, give this miss!
