Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bullying girlfriend, Kate (Eva Longoria) are examining last-minute agreements for their reception. It is the morning of their marriage and Kate is in a frenzy, giving restaurateurs a smell about her requests for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the "angel" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In a subsequent fight with the sculptor, the heavy "icy" girl falls on Kate and sends her to the afterlife. Now, a year later, Henry's sister orders a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate wanted her to start dating other women and move on. Still, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) is interested in Henry herself, much to the displeasure of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns to the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intention of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to get Kate back to heaven forever? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst that this passionate fan has ever seen. No, it's not the cast, trying to make things work. Longoria is as beautiful and funny as the arrogant boyfriend and Bell has an unusual style and humor that is equally contagious. Even Biggs, a funny actor, is completely wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted artist (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) tries his hardest and, in truth, is the main reason for seeing this clunker. Its charm, its looks and its wit are very useful to make the film bearable. But nothing can turn a mindless script and a terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you're a wool-dyed fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before spending money on it. Even free tickets fell on your lap, keep in mind that this film is an almost deadly experience for those who love the cinema of love and laughter.
