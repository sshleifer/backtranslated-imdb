First of all, I was also expecting another hero - a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it's better than HoFD. <br /> <br /> The basic elements of Hero are found in HoFD: grandiose landscapes, mesmerizing cinema and sincere acting (I mean, if you can't understand a word they say, without subtitles, but you still care - it's good acting) <br /> <br /> What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story. Worse, it's a love triangle similar to a soap opera. You have three characters who, I believe, fall in love with each other, for no good reason. This movie practically collapses after escaping from prison (I fell asleep for about forty minutes). It's almost like they changed writers at that point. The rest of the film is about how a character is "like the wind". Ick. Also, you really need to extend the suspension of disbelief to believe the action. This is not unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for the action, and then, when the fight breaks out, it wasn't so good. The beginning grabs you, but then this film runs out.
