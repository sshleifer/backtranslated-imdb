This movie is really bad. Maybe it's hard, but it is. Really. Poor script, every vampire clich√© is used in the book and no sympathy is given to the origins of the main character ... ie ole Dracula. There have been some really brilliant Dracula / vampire movies in the past, but this isn't even in the "terrible" slot. <br /> <br /> Take a selection of people who seem to have come out of a teen-slasher move, add a Dracula Lore dribble and mix in a heady tonic of religious / surreal day dreams ... and get confused in a movie - Dracula 2000. <br /> <br /> I really can't find anything positive to say about this film, as if it wasn't bad enough to have been made in the first place, it seems that it made Johnny Lee Miller has an English accent ... the problem is that I heard you cry ... Well, he is English, but he sounds like an American trying to make an English accent. <br /> <br /> All in all you can also say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it, look at it and see for yourself why it's as scary as the Tellytubbies. <br /> <br /> PS Even if La La is pretty scary!
