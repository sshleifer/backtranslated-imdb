I imagine it's Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the powerful performer he is, but empathy has a price like all things: when he's surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively lowers the standard and becomes one with it. It is a joke like a mafia killer (also because the part does not suit him a bit, being so extroverted) and simply touching he avoids making fun of himself in this. Kathleen Turner has had a career too long being tall and blonde, because her acting ability is limited to that thing she does with her eyes, when she opens them widely she is convinced that she is tremendously sexy and Anjelica Huston is the same absolute interesting) in everything, just like Robert Loggia. <br /> <br /> The film is a lousy draft (and this will be the only mention of the rag they call a script) of a gangster movie, with a cast that was probably only interested in going to the next fastest party (they have certainly gathered the celebrating elite in this). What, they fired in one day? - because this would be the only explanation.
