I really enjoyed this show, once upon a time. That is, until I realized all the flaws in it. It is so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even the least believable. Here because. ** Spoilers forward people ... ** Should we really believe that a child like Yugi would descend from a Pharaoh of ancient Egypt? Come on, come on! It is the largest nerd on the face of the Earth. And what happens with Pharaoh's hair (a.k.a. Atem and / or Yami)? The last time I checked, the pharaohs were shaved (except for a little hair on top of the head) and they wore fancy hats. <br /> <br /> And we should be convinced that a genius of the evil and rich boy, named Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while still having time to go to a shoddy little school like "Domino High "? Puh-leeze! First of all, he would have to legally be an adult to run a business. And that wouldn't make him a brilliant guy, since he's the only adult in his class. And secondly, why should he attend a school like "Domino High" when his affairs are clearly successful enough to allow him to attend a snobbish academy? Furthermore, the side plots with his little brother are so corny and lame. Every time you turn around, that guy was kidnapped by goons for the villain. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor boy, who lives with a good-for-nothing father. He says that Joey earns all the money to attend his school because his father is an alcoholic, but you've never seen Joey once do something that looks like work. He doesn't even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why choose a snob like Duke (who dressed his brother in a dog costume and publicly humiliated him on television) for a good guy like Tristan? Is she really so senseless? Various characters during the show are possessed by demonic forces, get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illnesses. (Oh, that's safe for children, NOT.) Tea is the typical type of girl next door, whose sole purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And while she has some interesting points for her, she doesn't have enough time to shine as the main character. <br /> <br /> Animation is simply horrible. All the characters seem sick and anorexic. The prospects are terrible (especially when they take close-up shots of someone's hand) and the colors look good, but not stellar. <br /> <br /> But the worst plot hole was the fact that Yami says his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. If so, how come he didn't save Yugi's grandfather in the first place when Pegasus stole his soul, and he saved himself the trouble of getting it back? <br /> <br /> Whatever it really is, is a commercial in itself. The only positive side is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Do something more useful. For example, look at the Abridged version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
