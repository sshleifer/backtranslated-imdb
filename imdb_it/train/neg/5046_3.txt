The lethargic regression ruins an otherwise compelling vintage story starring the wonderful Zhang Ziyi, in an excellent role as a woman who joins an extremist group in 1928 in China, just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and rejoins a former lover who is now working for Japan. Every little part of the drama and the forward movement of the story is sucked into the sleep-style directorial style of director Ye Lou. The characters remain still to stare at each other for long minutes, without saying anything, the cameras with steady hands forever on the faces that show endless reactions for longer than necessary, the repetition of repetitions is the triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters as the story begins and little new information is given as the story progresses, only the silence and the static shots of lovers who do not speak, who interact through silent dances but do not share any apparent emotional intimacy. A film that induces a lot of sleep.
