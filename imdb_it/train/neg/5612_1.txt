As a spiritualist and not a Christian. I really thought that I would hold back my faith, but what weight I have the visionaries. I thought the film would have great arguments, but only had a partial view from atheists and Jews ??? And who are all these street people who are interviewing and who don't know the back of their arm from their head. Where are the just theologians and priests and stuff from which he could get arguments. Non-retired peanuts who wrote books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally this DVD was a waste of time and it's not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if I should or shouldn't believe because an anti - Christ told me so. Please think that he has come to the conclusion of not finding God because his ego and his demons got the better of him. No, I'm not going to say that the film was amazing to help atheists read this feeling better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world that you care about us, poor souls who believe in Jesus, then attract us with your value, not your beating the drums.
