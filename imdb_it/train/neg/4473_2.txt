Dane tries to be tough and is extreme with all his screams and going crazy, pouring water on himself and rolling on the floor. Too much. Calm down, get together and make us laugh. I didn't fully understand his comparison with comics and rockstars. Just because they're both on stage or something? He said every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really interested in that when he was alive. He had some good jokes like the Burger King line where people scream at the drive thru. I also liked Reese's Pieces' line. If Dane didn't act so mentally, it might be more fun and I might have given him a higher score, maybe an eight high.
