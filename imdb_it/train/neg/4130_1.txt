One of the best contenders for the worst movie ever made. The character of Joanna Pakula seems to have an I.Q. of 3 which is only one less than the writer and director. The script would not have passed into a high school writing class; the "jokes" are youthful; the banal concept. These artists were obviously desperate for work. I stayed until the end just to see if it would get worse. He did it. Life is too short to pass any part of it watching this movie.
