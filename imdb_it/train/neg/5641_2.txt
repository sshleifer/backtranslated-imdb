Predictable, told a story a thousand times with the usual drama in the middle, a couple of rather vulgar sex scenes mixed with paranoia of characters, 70's style violinist horror music that is sometimes comic, I couldn't help but chuckle and me. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe, and it must be said that acting is not so bad, the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and makes you guess from time to time. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt like I was watching a movie for television drama instead of a new movie. Perhaps this is the style the directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before seeing the film could have been written only by someone involved in its production. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much, and if you could rewind the watch I wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema. I would wait for business containers in your video store, I'm sure it won't take long.
