I never understood the charm of Garbo. In his films he always comes across, not so tempting, and that annoying voice that could have drowned the section of the tuba. She was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swanson much better on the left in the age of silence. In his latest film, his performance is very mediocre and even unsafe. He tries hard but it all boils down to nothing because the script is even worse than his acting. <br /> <br /> A would be a dejected roar that is never credible and will never take off (even if Melvyn Douglas manages to fly in ski scenes, which are really the only fun thing here). <br /> <br /> There was potential but the script fails in almost all departments, wasting every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo have had enough chemistry together, but this is not even a point about Ninotchka, which I also found extremely overrated.
