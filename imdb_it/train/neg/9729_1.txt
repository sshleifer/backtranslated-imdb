Seriously, what's this? Hooper has made classic films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this terrible film, what happened? Did you dive into the crack a little too much? This film is about a guy named Sam who has the ability to set fire to the flames, (Firestarter, anyone?) The acting was crazy, the plot was garbage, and the special effects were extremely junk, they looked like something from the 70s. Should Van Damme be happy that Derailed is no longer the worst film ever and what was with the ending? started to glow blue, turned into a glowing blue blob, sucked in his girlfriend's fire and the movie is finished. WHAT WAS THAT? EH? when the movie ended I was hoping the DVD would be Spontaniously Combust to save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> DON'T THINK, OBEY, you will thank me later.
