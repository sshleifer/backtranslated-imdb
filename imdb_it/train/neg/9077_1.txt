If you like movies like American Pie, Road Trip and Van Wilder; avoid this cinematic rejection at all costs. It is an inexhaustible, petty, insipid waste of resources that should never be discussed aloud; much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easily the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; terribly bad for the entire 86 minutes of its runtime. If it had been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using swear words. Consider yourself warned!
