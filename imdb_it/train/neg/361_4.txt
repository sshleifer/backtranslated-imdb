After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the film, I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and films differ, but they were two different stories, only the names and part of the story of the book remained. Read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the film. The book offers you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you worry about them. The positions were really in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters not included. Television has warmed so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of this. The author's input does not always ensure a good movie, but sometimes it can help.
