"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama unpleasant." And for good reason: they are unbearable wooden and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And let's not joke: the critics were mostly favorable to the claims of Allen's Bergman, despite Allen's plaintive accusations against the contrary. What I don't understand is this: why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating Bergman, but the contemporary Brian DePalma was excoriated for "snatching" Hitchcock in his suspense / horror films? According to Robin Wood, it is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I should agree with that.
