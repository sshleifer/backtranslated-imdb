Basically this is a faint shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully played film with several rounds of really winning characters. Watching Detectives has none of this. <br /> <br /> The premise of a video game store geek has made its way from a mysterious and bizarre woman is a good idea, but it is never fully or adequately explored, thanks to a very weak script. the miscellany of leads, not to mention the lack of a true visual narrative style. I mean, this film is about MOVIES, yet it's incredibly kinematic! This is a serious failure here. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is simply that we don't care about the main characters because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) can't make them real or understand in any real way. So the film becomes just a series of episodes involving two people that seem, well, not terribly interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, another thing: for a romantic comedy? It's not funny. And romance isn't even too romantic. <br /> <br /> So avoid it. Even with the 90 minutes of running, it's not worth sitting ...
