I didn't expect much from "The Night Listener" and actually I never heard of it until I saw the cover in the video store. However, the film is very effective when it comes to building suspensions and tensions. Sometimes it drags on a bit, but in reality it helps to keep asking you what will happen and, more importantly: when. As the film progresses, the character played by Robin Williams is dragged into a sort of "cat and mouse cue" to the point where he becomes obsessed with discovering the truth and existence of an abused 14-year-old boy who no one seemed I've never seen him in person. The Night Listener is an interesting story, which is fantastic for creating suspense throughout the film and you're practically kept in the dark about who's lying and what's real. However, in the end this kind of disappoints and does not live up to the potential it could have had. It doesn't really give you a detailed or plausible explanation of the other main character, which would have been useful and interesting.
