This is a real bomb. We should believe that Merle Oberon is the kidnapped daughter of an ambitious politician who must demonstrate to the 1930s Tom DeLay that it is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle cannot go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their trembling and trembling minds and supported only by his kind uncle Harry Davenport. He joins his two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper appears to introduce himself. Some rodeo shots could have animated things, to the "Misfits", but no luck with this. Gary then breaks into a formal dinner, at which Merle presides, and, although invited to sit down and join the group, he reads them a lesson on their snobbery. Where does the sudden eloquence of this suspicious cowboy come from? The most atrocious scene in the film is a ghost party that Gary keeps in his unfinished home for his absent wife, Merle. It will never end? One to avoid.
