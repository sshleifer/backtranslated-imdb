OK, I'm blessed. I saw two very strong theatrical productions, one in New York with the original cast and another at the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, rock!). Compared to one of these, the film is almost unwatchable. I passed the DVD through the DVD in the last two nights and I have not finished yet. Too much foreign dialogue, and too many scenes and people added. Yes, the four main performances are quite good, esp. Mrs. Streep. But comparing theater to film is certainly an example of "less is more". The thickening of the game to satisfy the need for scenic variety and specificity of the public was a wrong choice. Please, please, go find a theatrical production somewhere near you.
