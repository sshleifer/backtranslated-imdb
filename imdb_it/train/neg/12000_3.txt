The only possible way to enjoy this movie is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal bleeding of your brain, let a bunch of brain cells die and once you're officially retarded, maybe then you * might * enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming thing was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the taxi driver and so was the English girl. Perhaps if they had created the whole movie about their escapades in India and how they eventually fell in love it would have made the movie a much more fun movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I voted for 3 is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy. <br /> <br /> Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted unnecessarily. Also the union scene at Heathrow was too much to swallow. Being an international traveler in the post 11 September world, Anil Kapoor would have shot himself long before he reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the film was to challenge logic, gravity, physics and spear an egg on the face of the public * GENERAL. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. At least I know I've been marked for life :(
