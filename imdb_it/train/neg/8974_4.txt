this film, I will not call it a "film", was basically of nothing and worked mainly for the popular acts of the time. yes, the war was in full swing (pun intended), and this film gave the troops and our audience a pleasure. <br /> <br /> but we have something with a little more substance. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed seeing a young friend full of drums. the music was good in everything. <br /> <br /> but one cameo after another gets old fast. <br /> <br /> I didn't even recognize Zero Mostel! so if you are one of the "greatest generation", as they say, you will surely like this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
