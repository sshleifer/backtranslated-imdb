All the logic comes straight out of the train window in this British horror film, set in the London subway and played by the usual reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), Franka plays Kate, a businesswoman arriving from an office party for meet friends who fall asleep in a subway station, only to wake up and find out that she has been locked up and finds herself chased by "someone" or "something" with killer intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and unbelievable are the order of the day there are very few moments that are actually nervous or scary, but in abundance they are simply boring. <br /> <br /> All in all an unpleasant film that should remain closed forever underground and do us all a favor. <br /> <br /> The only plus point here is the inclusion in the cast of the popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who has done better than this ?? this even includes "Erasmus Microman"!
