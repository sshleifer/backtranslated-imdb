These 2 points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood films don't really try to be realistic, but PLEASE, a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and does what a good parent does ... hunt the child with his wife INCINTA. Some things that were too difficult to digest: 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and to go from one to live hungry in her in-laws garden shed ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stuntman, gets bitten by a rabid dog, and then leaves. This film is an INSULT for our intelligence. I can't really believe that I contributed financially to the "people" who made this film by bringing my family to see it, we left the cinema with a frown, please don't submit to this mess for watch this recommend my advice and don't waste your "waqt".
