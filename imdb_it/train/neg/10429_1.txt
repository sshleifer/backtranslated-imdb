The first half was OK, but the last half was really very disappointed. It's funny that the producers even admitted they didn't have a clue to the finale, and this really showed. What is really sad is that I have to write ten lines of minimum comment to be able to publish it. I didn't want to include spoilers to qualify my observations because the show doesn't really deserve this effort. When Battlestar galatica first came out, I was really excited by the prospect of a better remake, it didn't happen that the first season ended up being space pornography. In the end they cleaned up a bit and actually had a fair enough drama, so I started looking again. But to finish the series with kara who is a hurricane god angel, the same with Baltar and six was rather stupid.
