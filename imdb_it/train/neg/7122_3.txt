"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you die watching - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror film: the intriguing husband marries a rich woman with a history of mental illness, then tries to convince her that she is going crazy with shrill noises, mysterious knocks and skulls that appear at inappropriate times. Add to the formula a pretty disturbing gardener who still keeps the memory of the first wife of the man to whom it was dedicated. Maybe it's just that the 1950s didn't have the technology to bring out some of the scary scenes needed to make this film, the techniques used here seem ingenious and trivial. But then again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" at the age of nine, he gave me the jebies in the same way that I'm sure this movie was made for young viewers of the same era. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, sometimes it seems tedious. But there is a great deal of atmospheric tension in the Whitlock house, generally huge but unfurnished, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best scene to play involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) who goes obsessively in the pond in an attempt to recover the hidden skull, he just gets dressed and everything, in sharp contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a double role). Makes you wonder who the real idiot was. <br /> <br /> In his good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie: how about that beautiful tramp that the Whitlocks make their first appearance in ... 1958! This at least made me jump out of my seat!
