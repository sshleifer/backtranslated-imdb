the cover of the box makes this movie really beautiful, don't be fooled. the splatter university came out in 1984, which was the last good year for horror, but this movie sucks. the characters are so annoying. only the teacher is cool. there is no plot for this film, who the hell could ever make this film waste? <br /> <br /> spoilers in advance <br /> <br /> the teacher dies in this, and was a female, we all know that we must have a surviving female, if you intend to break the rules do it in a good horror movie, not this waste
