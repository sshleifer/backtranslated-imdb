Sorry, this movie didn't scare me, it just annoyed me. It was so frustrating when I saw the potential and this, all of this, has fallen by the wayside. The children! The father! The premonition! It had so much potential and ziltch! zero, nada! I've heard it all before. Frightening! No! I can scare myself, here where I sit, than they could in the movie. Are there men who write that amount that women should be so annoying? Eh? This film was quite atmospheric. Or at least it could have been, if the director / writer had taken the trouble to work on it. We could have had good music that would have added tension if someone had made the effort. What I really want to know is why do they get the money? Give it to me and save all this trouble. Abandoned? ... No, where we have been betrayed
