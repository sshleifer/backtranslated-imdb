this film had a pretty good plot, but the pasta was very slow ... really very slow. even if someone thinks this is a cult classic, I think there are better films of that era to watch. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is not excellent, but neither is the worst. the sounds are OK. lighting OK. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone but a film student. <br /> <br /> the film contains no music, and the horses that have sex don't even make it good and the woman who masturbated on the edge of the bed was simply stupid. <br /> <br /> no winnings here, skip this total boredom. I've seen worse, believe me, but this is just a waste of time, and I don't have the positive reviews here. especially the high grades ...
