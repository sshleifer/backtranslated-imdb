European holidays (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) are Vacation's weakest films (the first and third the topmost film). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they have a weaker screenplay with bad dialogues. This causes pacing to suffer, with jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film is the fact that the "jokes" as they are, are simply glued together in a crumpled script), rather than serving as a central plot like the other 3 holiday films. Oh well, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10.
