Man would expect that a film shot with a ca. budget of 300,000,000 U $ D should at least entertain you for the time you are in the cinema watching physically. "Matrix Reloaded" erroneously demonstrates this assumption. <br /> <br /> "The Matrix" worked better, despite having obvious holes in the logic of the story. At least no one could explain to me why beating a bot (agent alias) in a simulation (aka martix) would somehow damage the computer program responsible ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers did exactly this "fighting game of the agents" is the main thing in "Matrix Reloaded": it is a fighting game on o-rama. These combat scenes can be sufficient (or quite interesting) in 5 seconds. trailer, but prolonged for several minutes, apparently falsified, poorly choreographed and repeated over and over again is nothing but boring. Despite seeing the promising spectacular stunts, there is nothing more than a simple low-quality bashing, devoid of imagination, already seen (or rather) in eg. Van Damme "film". The post-production difference (ether is 5 times faster, the camera fluctuates a lot and hangs on certain scenes, and this is repeated for at least 5 minutes) does not help here, all this has nothing to do with the meaning itself of "martial arts". In addition to these "fights", all the actors refuse to do what they are paid for: acting. <br /> <br /> What happens besides the fight scenes? Few except for the Hollywood routine. This hippie group, so multicultural, that sucked "Waterworld", is recycled as a citizen of "Zion" (the last city on earth), and on Morpheus' orders they start dancing, because this is a good opportunity to show a lot of tits and newly covered butts. The clich√© so popular of the French aka frog that speaks with this "je ne sais quoi" silent accent, which wastes its fortune due to a "liason d'amour" is bravely served. Following this (and unwanted) is the struggle between Neo and the sinister followers of the "frog", since it takes place in an Erroy Flynn as enterieur, which fortunately has many combat weapons for decoration. For Neo who poses with the hellebarde, add only 2 scales and a lot of statues (to be destroyed, thrown at evil men and the like) and get 5 more senseless and boring minutes. of this garbage. <br /> <br /> What can you expect? The usual hell of merchandising. And "revolutions" that will happen or not - certainly without me.
