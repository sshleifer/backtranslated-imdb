After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that ruined Scooby-Doo's success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for adults and children together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy who always seemed ready to hit someone. Scooby and Shaggy were scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need any annoying little nephew puppy. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they would have to kill or never thought of Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids will prefer it!
