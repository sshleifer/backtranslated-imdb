Why watch this? There is only one reason and this is for the greatness of John Saxon. I love his acting. My favorite appearances from him are in Nightmare On Elm Street 1.3 and 7 as Nancy's father, cop, Black Christmas as a cop and Da Dusk Till Dawn again as a cop. When I was rummaging in my shop at the local mall I came across the movie Zombie Death House and dusted it off right away, but before moving on I noticed that John Saxon wasn't just an actor in this movie, but for the first time heard of a director. This intrigued me (even the low price of $ 9.00) and I and I had to have it. Upon returning home, I realized that this film was not up to Saxon's other works, even his acting, which may have been confused by further pressures from the director. But it wasn't just him who sucked the other actors too. It seemed they had all been pulled out of a recent porn photo and now they have told the kids that you really have to act. The film also looks like 80s porn quality. I cannot in good faith recommend this film to casual viewers, but if you are an obsessed 80s fan who lost the culture that came from that time having been born late, or a shitty movie fan of this is for . Even if you dig John Saxon like I do.
