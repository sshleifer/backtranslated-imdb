A good story for a movie that, if done correctly, would be quite interesting, but where the hell is the end of this movie? <br /> <br /> Actually, what's the point? <br /> <br /> The scenes shoot so fast that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally, and the feeling of being detached from understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> Cast performances are questionable, if not credible. <br /> <br /> Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the movie? I imagine we will have to wait for the sequel. <br /> <br />
