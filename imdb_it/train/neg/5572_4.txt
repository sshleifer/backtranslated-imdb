Yet another colorful excuse for men in rubber suits to fight each other. This time, future travelers arrive in 1992 and recruit some people to return with them until 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan from destruction. But having accomplished this task, do time travelers turn out to be a group of double cruisers whose very creature is furious and without Godzilla to stop it? Eek! It all sounds very silly, and it probably is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle also seems pretty good. Unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just garbage rather than amusing, and the film is just as boring as its predecessors. Look for Spielberg's shaky prank.
