What was Steven Seagal thinking? I want to say first that I love Seagal. I love all his films until the mid-2000s. His first things are among the best of the genre. This however does not live up to its excellent name. Attack Force (with protagonist Marshall Lawson {Seagal}) should be a mindless action movie with Seagal in typical donkey style. However, what we get is a criminal mystery, bordering on a political thriller with little or no action. Seagal is always in the shade due to its weight. I could not follow this story. There are people who change into superhumans when they take a drug. What happened in this film. Seagal's dubbing is a disgrace, a mess and a shame. Why double the man? The story is terrible. This gave me a 2/10 because of the scene in which Seagal asks for backup despite having an army with him, and a hilarious fighting scene in which Seagal swings his hands like a girl facing the camera! "Revenge is a two-way street," says Seagal in this film ... well, forget Steven's revenge, you need redemption!
