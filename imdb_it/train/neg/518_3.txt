Bela Lugosi is not a typist in this fantastic 12-part serial, playing the role of Frank Chandler / Chandu the Magician, enjoying her role as representative of the White Magic forces pushed against those of Black, while showing vigorous fighting skills, successfully courting a young Egyptian princess and cutting a slim and agile figure in recreational gear, complete with a nautical cap. The slightly lumpy plot involves Chandler / Chandu in an unbroken series of escapades aimed at reaching the rescue of his girlfriend, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of Ubasti's idol-worshiping sect, which aspires to Nadji's blood for Ravviva an ancient mummified princess buried in the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand at such amusements, keeps the events in motion, but has repeated scenes and filming, a good part of which is in the Skull Island setting of the previous year by KING KONG, and the port venue of SON OF KONG, reduces the original action to less than 60 minutes from the duration of the series of the serial for over two and a half hours and, if viewed in a single session, it becomes ineffective for most viewers, unless be sleepless.
