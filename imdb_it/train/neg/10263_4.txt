Yes, The Southern Star presents a rather forgettable melody of the title sung by that heavy crooner set Matt Monro. He practically sets the tone for this swollen and rather boring feature, incredibly uncomfortable with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple looking for a big diamond. Add Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of wild animal repertoire and a sparse, boring photograph by Raoul Coutard, and end up with an absolutely heady game in the Senegal jungle.
