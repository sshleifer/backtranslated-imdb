Why, oh, why won't they learn? When you have an interesting and succulent idea, use it! Don't go around trying to get everything deep and thoughtful; you're just silly. <br /> <br /> Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little too much of mom kissing (Santa Claus dressed as Santa Claus) when he was a child So naturally, Harry grows obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he turns around, dresses like Santa Claus, wanders around the city handing out toys to good children and brutally kills anyone he thinks bad. <br /> <br /> Simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror films use the same trick?) Unfortunately, this film is more "Santa Claus, Portrait of a serial killer" than "Silent Night, Deadly Night". Two-thirds of the film is spent on documenting Harry's slow but inevitable breakup when I was willing to buy the premise when the opening credits were approaching. You know that a film slasher is in trouble when you find yourself pushing the killer to keep doing it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we have a boy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and show. Action leaps dramatically from one scene to another, without creating clear shots or visions of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing. <br /> <br /> Even once the film is coming, we are still treated to help Harry's self-pity, insecurity and neurotic behavior. More depressing than scary, the Evil of Christmas is to be avoided.
