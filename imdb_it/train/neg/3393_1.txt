If you really have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is in a romantic mood, let her be a boy. But be prepared to bring your hp if it's a radio. <br /> <br /> Having seen a film as beautiful as Arisan (2003), it is terrible to see again what they invented in Indonesia. It seems that the only idea is to make money, but no one seems to seriously work on the image of Indonesia in the entertainment world. That it is a "global" world does not seem to emerge in the minds of those who make films in Indonesia. And since the Indonesian public swallows everything that is presented to them as "Made in Indonesia" with a taste of the west, they get along. <br /> <br /> OK, the story is nice to begin with. And it could have become a good movie. But the director has never thought about the fact that a musical needs first of all live music Or at least a good reproduction, and secondly a good choreography? In this film, reproduction is so BAD that it makes you want to cry right there in the cinema. Every single word you hear is followed seconds later by the actor or the singer, and it is extremely annoying when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> The choreography is as if they had planned to make a movie about morning gymnastics, but in the end I thought it would be nice to turn it into a musical ... They just forgot to change the choreography. It's hard to dance, you see, they jump here and there, they raise their legs in the air, and that's all. <br /> <br /> Well, at least there's a happy ending ... But if you can convince your girlfriend that a nice candlelight dinner is much more romantic, FAI!
