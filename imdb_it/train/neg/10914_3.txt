Isn't it funny when an average person leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical, it happens to him, putting his life upside down and making him learn some valuable lessons along the way? That formula never gets old, does it? It's a really safe way to make a classic movie! Just look at the most important successes like Liar Liar and Big! ... This must have been Rob Schneider's line of thought when he made the semi-success Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed him with The Animal. Since I have already traced the plot through sarcasm, let me color it more: Schneider plays a losing cop who is suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is surgically rescued ... by a veterinarian who loads him with parts of animals, making him neigh like a horse in inappropriate moments, run like a cheetah, etc. This film is slightly more sympathetic than other films with Schneider (like another limping sequel to The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like they want the audience to hate it by launching a reality TV star as the romantic lead (Colleen Haskell of "Survivor") and entering a cameo by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene ... it simply doesn't exist. Sorry - nothing memorable except the production value. I just want to conclude this review by saying that small references to other films in a film may be fine, but when it comes to lines delivered in exactly the same way ("You can do it!"), There is a word for this - "milking. " In fact, here is another word: "economic".
