Another horror film in which a goof-ball teenager fights a madman and his supernatural companion who wants to take over ?! Yes, but the fact that this was from Canada gives it a slightly different look. "The Brain" has the annoying teenager Jim Majelewski who undergoes a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a bad "brain". Can Jim stop it? I imagine that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all they have done, they have the right to make at least one ridiculous horror film. But anyway, they will probably want to be known for having national health care and everything. <br /> <br /> The villain had a brain. Why didn't the people who made this film do it?
