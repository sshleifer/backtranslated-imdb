I love movies and I will watch all the films to the end, just to give them a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie that I can't watch to the end. The acting is terribly stale and monotonous, the CGI looks like a computer fanatic, he did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and ... the long scenes of ... just walking !!!! And this film is THREE HOURS LONG !!! I didn't even do it 15 minutes before I quickly forwarded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "War of the Worlds", allows us to call this "War of the long distances on foot". This cost $ 5 million! What is the money on, the dramatic opening song? <br /> <br /> Oh, but on a positive note, a scene you have to look at is when the aliens start killing people. It's funny, not because people die, but because when they turn to the skeletons, they fight again for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> So ... like I said, if you're a fan of the boring, stale, movie with no action, here's one for your DVD collection. But I didn't write it for you, I wrote it for billions and billions of other people who hate this movie. Not worth your time or your money <br /> <br /> I know this is the book, but the book is not so long, and I'm a complete worm / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give this a BIG, FAT ZERO out of 10.
