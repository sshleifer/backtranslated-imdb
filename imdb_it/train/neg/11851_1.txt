This was a disappointment - none of the nuances of the original. The British seem to be able to create a truly shocking film without the exaggerated histrionics of the American version. The original series combined gruesome stories and subtlety of execution with great attention to lighting and settings. I've seen the series many times and I'm still fascinated. <br /> <br /> Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the "Cracker" adaptation. Get involved with BBC America or BBC Canada and view the delights of Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then search for "Wire in the Blood" to get the truly sober and elegant performance of Robson Green. Hollywood needs to take a look at this actor!
