This film is one of the most terrible I've ever seen. Not only is the dialogue terrible, it never ends. You will think it will end, but it is not. How long, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I know I'll never look at it again. It is as if someone had taken a romantic comedy, pulled out the play, then decided to play down the romance, leaving us with the pile of shit that managed to reach the screen. But don't believe me, find out how terrible this movie is.
