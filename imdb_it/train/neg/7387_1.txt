The DVD was a joke, the audio for the first few minutes was terrible with the sound out of sync and Segals' voice wasn't even his !!!! Pathetic! When the audio synchronization was better in about 5 minutes, the poor plot, the lines and the actors should get another job because the cinema business is not where they should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good movies in the last few days they are a joke and should be an embarrassment to him and to the company that did it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one who handled this, it would be better to go back to having another party for the show, because he has no talent as ever in this. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete embarrassment for all those involved in its production and a disgrace for all those who have seen it. I turned it off in about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask Block Buster for my money! Mark from Ontario, Canada
