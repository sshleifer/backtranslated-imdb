If you don't mind having to deal with your emotions, then you won't mind this movie. On the other hand, if you like the mysteries of British crime, following the clues and seeing how everyone logically settles in the end, you will be very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment: <br /> <br /> * While the police used CCTV cameras to collect clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before his disappearance was not captured on camera. This is a fundamental piece of mystery. It is not consistent to have the car with which the children were captured by the camera and not the big truck that is so important for the mystery. <br /> <br /> * The film does everything to show the refinement of the equipment in tracking down the movements of the children, but does not have the possibility of using the same sophisticated equipment to track the vehicles that could have entered the crime scene from places visible to the camera adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is on the left. The director does everything to have the car in the crime park on the right, several meters away from the flower stand, when he could easily park immediately behind, or even to the side; how did the huge truck. <br /> <br /> * The forensic police team is so meticulous that they find a cell phone discarded in a sewer several miles from the crime scene, but can't find any blood from the head injury at the crime scene , even if they have secured the scene a few hours after the disappearance and without intermittent precipitation. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used to find missing children; this from the country which is well known for the development of the hunting dog for research and hunting. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that such highly publicized news does not ignite the supposedly innocent truck driver who stopped at the flower stand. <br /> <br /> * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and take so much effort to leave clues of wool fiber under her fingernails for her possible murder investigators, even pushing her daughter to do the same ... while she simply could not have escaped from the unattended mobile home. If he had had enough sense on his part to ask his daughter to take the carpet fibers under his fingernails, he could easily have asked his daughter to ask for help or even leave the mobile home in a crowded residential park. > <br /> * The suspect who kidnapped the child was portrayed as mentally slow / obscured - justifying her unknowingly drowning her mother ?? but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and even fully exercise his rights not to incriminate himself. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies like this that will lead to a real disappointment on the part of the fan. 'Five Days' is a very weak British crime story.
