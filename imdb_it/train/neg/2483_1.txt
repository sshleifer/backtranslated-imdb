A discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi music (!!), Americana prebellica and Agatha Christie that let out a big, big problem: it's deadly little fun. In addition to the I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most surprising aspect of "Lady ..." is the berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) tries hard: he plays a romantic role (with his appearance !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen should create a club for ageless comedians without a mirror), and he tries be moving and fun, moving and intelligent, and try to sing and dance, and it happens in NONE !! A long shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. <br /> <br /> For a while I thought I was having a myopia in shape, because everyone in the movie keeps saying that Cherry Jones is a pretty hot girl and Michael Cumpsty is this incredibly beautiful stud !! The guy who plays the male secretary of Claire Bloom is a thin and bald actor, sexy as a chair, and is the object of the passion of the two main women !! The exaggerated actor of Mike Starr as the most incompetent and policeman I have ever seen deserves to rank among the 10 most horrible performances in recent cinema history. The saddest note is to see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely wrong and offensive. At least I hope that both stars pay their bills at home (and later fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder the acting producer Sukowa has returned to Germany after seeing what Hollywood had in store for her !! <br /> <br /> If you want to see how to make a really bad movie from a really bad script with a casting berserk director, study this - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
