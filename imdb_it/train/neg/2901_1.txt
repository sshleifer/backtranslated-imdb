The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb makes me realize that their staff at Junket work hard trying to get people to watch this absolutely awful movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, I have no idea where to start describing the really terrible movie I had last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I felt something for his character and enjoyed the dialogue, but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about the cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so invented, the family this family of cutting boards from Walton and the film was so many times before I am shocked, someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and make a terribly bad film I don't believe everything you read on IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by people sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD movie.
