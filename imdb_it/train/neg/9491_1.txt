This movie really makes you appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on the remote control. It is an exquisite boredom in beautiful photos. For once, Hamilton moves relatively easily with soft focus shooting. However, what I found difficult to say about the film is that although Anja Schüte was around 19 when she was shot, the girls are portrayed much younger than they really are. This whole Lolita thing, especially because there is an older man involved, leaves me rather uncomfortable. Heroin is actually shaved in the pubic area to make it look even younger than her. Come on, sex is a beautiful time spent among consenting adults. Another thing that I found strange is that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, at least not the right one.
