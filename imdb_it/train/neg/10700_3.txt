The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his relationship with the character of Amelia Earhart played by Katherine Hepburn. Until they met, he had been a very devoted husband, but when he met the strange but charming Hepburn, "he couldn't help himself" and they fell in love. You can say it, because they look a lot in space and speak HUGE about how painful their unrequited love is. Frankly, this is a terribly dated film and virtually impossible to watch. Part of the problem is that in the days before the Code, films that adulterated adultery were very common. Moreover, even if you accept this morally suspect subject, the absolute boldness of the dialogue makes it seem like a 19th century romance ... and really bad. Sticky and with characters that are difficult to interpret (after all, Clive's wife is a good woman and didn't hurt anyone) makes this a big waste of time. The only interesting aspect of this film is the costume that Hepburn wears in one of the first scenes in which he wears a moth costume! You have to see it to believe it - and you look like one of the Bugaloos (obscure but appropriate reference).
