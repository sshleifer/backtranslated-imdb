I'm sorry but this is simply pathetic. The girl was a brat, they weren't nice characters and the plot sucked. Also, he wasn't even an alligator like the movie would have us believe. If you check some complete guide to reptiles, you will find that it is indeed a crocodile, not an alligator. Obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or knew that the creature is a crocodile. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the ending. I almost fell asleep with this.
