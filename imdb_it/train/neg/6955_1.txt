I can't see the charm of this series (which should be science fiction). It's really just "let's see what this soap is working this week" and, oh, the Cylons are involved through flashbacks. <br /> <br /> The Cylon "babe" who continues to nail the other guy is pretty lame, it's pretty obvious that T & A has been added to the show. Whenever he appears, I am baffled that the WTF should go on. And don't even try to tell me about "narrative arcs". <br /> <br /> It is a soap opera with some CGI thrown in. This is not science fiction apart from the original premise. <br /> <br /> This series is not all that worked. If you like works with fashionable, sharp-edged, risky, bouncy and vague cameras, this show could be suitable for you. Since nerds seem enthusiastic about this show, it's a clear indication that the opinions of vocal nerds have been changed by Picard's TNG.
