Horror movies can be a lot of fun with low budgets, bad acting and a little panache. I think the movie just lacks a bit of panache, because, one scene after another heavily opaque, people make unmistakable claw scratches in the air. If it wasn't so boring, it could be fun. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can go a long way with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house", more or less in the same way as Evil Dead movies had a lot of fun with a plot similar. Unfortunately, Hallow's End doesn't go far. Actually, it's not going anywhere. He spends most of an hour creating anonymous and anonymous characters with what appears to be an endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against the development of the character, not even in a horror film, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha-male, the milquetoast, the ... um ... characters to throw away that exist mainly for scenes of sex.) Spending more than forty minutes without blood, droning minutes with them was more horrible than when bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, the bloodshed implied. When college kids turn into what they have dressed for their haunted house (one is a vampire, one wears an O.R. scrub and some white pancake) it looks just like they did in their haunted amateur house costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, using a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is really nothing to talk about, nor are there really fears. <br /> <br /> I've thought of this from almost every approach. If it were supposed to be a tense and suspenseful horror film (which would explain why things moved so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and the cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it were supposed to be an authentic horror movie of blood and guts (which would explain the schlock) ... where is the blood and the liver? And the anticlimax is one of the non-exciting endings of a movie I've ever seen. It is the kind of film that, even if it does not have a narrator through the film, is suspended from dubbing because all meaningless dialogue was not enough. <br /> <br /> This was difficult ... coming out of it, I wonder if I just had a Christian horror movie. Perhaps the "I know hell exists" of the opening was not meant that way, but there are some clues (or direction errors - I'm not sure which one). For all the swear words in the film, a joke like "gosh-darnit" turns out to be a bit absurd, as do most of the crucifix he adores, God-fearing and satan, especially after some free sex scenes T & A (a heterosexual, a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it is a Christian company (the Highland Myst logo also bears a certain resemblance to the crucifix), then this film weighs heavily on the atheist camp. An omnipotent being cannot be as bad as a director. <br /> <br />
