A somewhat strange spy mystery with a predictable plot about the dangers of the Second World War. The mystery is whether Jane Graystone (Nancy Coleman) has amnesia or not. The best acting is made by Raymond Massey as Dr. Ingersoll, a good doctor turned bad. He is at the head of an espionage ring that attempts to obtain information from Jane amnesia, coded information relating to allied activities. Will he say it? She remembers? Moroni Olson (like Mr. Goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to Massey. The role played by John Garfield (as Dr. Lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. It seems so misplaced that the casting must be classified as one of the worst in film history. It is a pity that such a talented actor is involved in a role that is not suited to his talents. The film deserves a look, despite being a half-spy and half-gangster film, and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters. It is easy to forget it, amnesia is not necessary.
