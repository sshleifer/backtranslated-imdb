I'm a big fan of the B5, having been involved only at the end of the third season. I faithfully looked at all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well thought-out narrative arcs to hit television. The filling episodes were also interesting. Furthermore, the films were as well produced and fun as anything to hit theaters. <br /> <br /> Which leads us to "River of Souls". Of course, after seeing everything else, I had great expectations. It seems that Martin Sheen is acting in an Ed Wood movie rather than a serious science fiction story. The story itself could have looked good in the form of a pattern, even made for the board. However, he obviously suffers when it's time to fill this concept in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects that entertain us in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they were obviously short of time and they improvised the dialogue to fill the story. If he had done the regular season, he would have been ranked among the worst of the episodes.
