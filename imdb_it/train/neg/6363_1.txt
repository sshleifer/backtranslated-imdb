I haven't seen anyone play this movie yet and I think I could be the first. <br /> <br /> It was horrible. I actually didn't look at the end of it. It was like watching a boring or really good soap (all soaps suck). The actors were poor and the plot was bad. The person who rated him 10/10 has no idea what it is. The script was horrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation together that involved threats and you expect the good guy to say something really good and give him crap but no. He says "If you do ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look ahead. Please don't watch this movie because ... IT'S CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Poor acting, bad arguments, bad script. <br /> <br /> Don't look! Of course this is in my opinion.
