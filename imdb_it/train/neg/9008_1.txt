There were a lot of unknown movies or movies with bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them. <br /> <br /> Shooting techniques were developed and used that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ridiculously predictable and took most of the movie to go on, then let you ask "is that all?" Once I decided not to take the film too seriously and to look at it from a purely trivial point of view has become more pleasant. This is a movie that would have ended up on MST3000 if it was still on.
