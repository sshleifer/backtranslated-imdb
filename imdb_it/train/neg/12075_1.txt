This Hamlet was created for one of the most boring MST3000 episodes ever. I'm not a fan of Shakespeare, but I don't think he ever thought his work was so slow and squalid. It is also one of the most difficult films to find because there are so many listed hamlets. Like I said though this is pretty boring. It is black and white, the pace is slow and the scenario is minimal. Even the actors are nicknamed, so it doesn't help. This is the only MST 3000 that I can't see in one sitting because the guy who plays Hamlet says his lines can put someone to sleep.
