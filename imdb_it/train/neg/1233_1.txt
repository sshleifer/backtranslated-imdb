My God. the idea that this film is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. also the point that seems to have been written by a 5-year-old child. the plot, the acting and even the props and the shooting of this film have all been beyond shame. <br /> <br /> Usually I'm not that critical of any film, because every person has his style. But this film, however, was probably the worst movie I saw in 2008. I can honestly believe that this film is unknown, and I think it should stay that way, because movies like these are making the thriller a joke. /> <br /> I recommend anyone who is a fan of thriller movies or just movies to stay away from this.
