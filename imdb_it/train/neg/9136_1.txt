When the film started, I was shocked to see that it was shot with a cheap video camera! In fact, the camera shakes and looks worse than the normal home movie. Even movies on DVD should have better production values ​​than this! Heck, a large percentage of home videos uploaded to YouTube have better production values! Too often, the film seems to be made by sticking the camera on a tripod and turning it on, without the camera! Close-ups and anything resembling camera work are absent in some scenes where they may have worked and in others there are too many or badly framed close-ups. Yecch! <br /> <br /> The film is about two gays who want to get married. As if it had been done almost a decade ago, their only option was to get married in Vermont - times have definitely changed. However, the recent acceptance of gay marriage can in no way be attributed to this film - if anything, it supports gay marriage supporters instead of helping the film as the stench and never seriously tries to seriously address the problem. According to the film, religious people are one-dimensional idiots who carry Bibles EVERYWHERE and shoot people and wives who have narrow-minded gay husbands when they learn that their spouses have lived a lie. I am sure he is offering a genuine opportunity for both parties on the problem! <br /> <br /> The bottom line - nothing in the film shows any professionalism and even hesitates to call it a movie. It's more like a movie at home and doesn't even deserve a quote on IMDb or even the inclusion in the list of Lower IMDb of 100 of the worst movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the writing is horrible, the direction (if there is one) is horrible, the work with the camera is horrible and the plot is horrible. It's a movie at home !! There is nothing positive that I can say about it in any way except that it makes Ed Wood's films look like Oscar contenders in comparison and I'm sure Mr. Wood's ghost smiles every time someone looks at this casino! <br /> <br /> I don't care if you are gay or heterosexual - this film is not worth your time and I don't know how they managed to make DVDs of it. I assume one of the actors burns them on his home computer during his spare time! Seriously, this gives new meaning to the word "bad"! <br /> <br /> By the way, if the only woman in the film was a real lawyer, wouldn't the ability to read be an important prerequisite ?! I'm just saying. <br /> <br /> Finally, since gay marriage is such a serious and important subject, can we not have a BETTER movie than THIS that solves the problem ?! Unfortunately, this only encourages laughter.
