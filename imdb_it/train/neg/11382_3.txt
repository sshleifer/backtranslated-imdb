Someone notes that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. Angry eyes seem to give every enemy. 2. The grip of the hands to face, open mouth and frightened eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. <br /> <br /> I must say that I almost hate this show, I don't look at it but it's like Code Lyoko, we watched at least one, I have to say that this show is borderline racist, uninteresting and useless. <br /> <br /> each episode ends with the winning robotboy, except for one exception when robotboy lets this freakazoid go flying over a jetpack. <br /> <br /> Even the jokes are pretty raw, I think it's mostly the people who say the word "Suck" or fart, I think even the show's bullies are quite shocking. <br /> <br /> There is no one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for god's sake, what kind of school is going. Not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities. <br /> <br /> The whole show I hear is ripping me off megas XLR and Fosters. As you could say the trio of coop, jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy is similar to Megas where he beats everyone, no matter what the odds are and he is free of spirit despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> There's simply no appeal to this show, I'm surprised it's still running.
