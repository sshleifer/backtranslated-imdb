I saw this movie in New York City. I was waiting for a bus the next morning, so it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining, and he didn't want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY. So I crossed the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad, that I chose to stay and see the whole movie, I haven't seen anything that bad since. The year was 69, so call me crazy. I stayed alone because I couldn't believe it .........
