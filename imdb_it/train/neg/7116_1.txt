* WARNING * Possible spoilers below <br /> <br /> The film is more boring than anything else. There seems to be some attempt to create tension through poorly lit shots of empty rooms and empty lawns, but nothing works. <br /> <br /> MST3K has done a good job, but by itself the film is mostly boring. <br /> <br /> Amusing moments: <br /> <br /> When the fake skull detaches from a pile of ashes, the wife becomes hysterical and dizzy while the husband (who is trying to lead the mad wife) he says in an impassive voice "There is no skull there, there is no skull." <br /> <br /> When the real ghost skulls have the husband caught in a pickle, as if he were trapped between the first and second base.
