Okay, I have to say before the "monster" was revealed. saying that it really didn't fit into that category, just a strange thing that sounded annoying! And personally I think a grandma could have escaped from that thing, but anyway. Actually I was getting into this movie, even though having the main character a drunk and a heroin addict didn't come as an appeal. But scenes like when he escapes from the train, and you can see the figure at the door was a little creepy, even where the guard had just been killed and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster stalled from the moment the monster was revealed it became your average horror, with chills or limited fear. I gradually became more bored and wanted to close it. I like that most people said they were rooting for the homeless to make it, especially for the guy, he made me some economic laughs here and there. I think this film could have really been something special, instead it has become what every other horror is today! Simply boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a cheap scare here and there, or an irreverent gore festival (which is limited, almost no facts) at all costs give it a go, but for all of you observers serious horror look elsewhere, much better movies out there.
