One of the many surveillance epics that invaded the market in the mid-1980s. The routine plot has echoes of "The Magnificent Seven" (believe it or not), the action scenes are handled blandly and the special effects are non-existent. I could do worse .... but the film is still only a waste of time. (* 1/2)
