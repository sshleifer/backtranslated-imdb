I remember reading all the horrible and horrible reviews of this movie when it came out. I wanted to see how horrible it was, but it was out of the cinemas in three weeks. The only other film to manage is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie was released on DVD, I bought it to see how horrible it was. I couldn't think of the pure and horrible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that this film is not without interesting shots. There is a nice shot at the beginning showing a bullet fired from inside the gun, which I thought was clean. And the way the monsters in this movie die is a little cold to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> I would like to start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting were a sin, then Hell would have thrown out Tara Reid because it's so incredibly horrible in this movie that it's unthinkable. And of all roles, he plays a curator. Now, if you play a mute and empty sex toy, maybe I might be able to forgive you for how you treat your character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize it, although he seemed to think that if he took his shirt off in the movie, people would see him. He simply didn't realize that making this movie in the middle of the movie at the wrong time made the movie even more exhilarating. And is it a Mexican song or something during the dry humping scene? I could not say. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst directing skills you could ever see in a movie. I mean, I would give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few films), but HotD will score at least one B compared to this piece of ruined garbage. The film begins with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible storyteller) and from there the cuts are really stupid. There is this point where Slater and Reid look around a building that has been destroyed and the screen darkens. When he returns, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Eh? <br /> <br /> And someone didn't bother checking the errors in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before touching it. Tara Reid's earrings change color in the middle of a scene and after Slater moves away from a dead companion, you can see her start to get up. <br /> <br /> As for the story ... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe that frees darkness and someone "leads the way" or something and all the evil monsters open up. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this movie) that he simply gets BORING. <br /> <br /> I bought this film hoping to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think he's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
