I was lucky enough to meet George Pal (and I still have my DS: TMOB autographed poster) at a convention shortly after the release, and I asked him why he chose to make the "camp" movie. Before he could answer, two study flops intercepted me and explained to me how the studio "knew better" and how "no one will take a film like that seriously". I was reading Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (did ComiCon participants from the 70s remember Blackhawk and his band? I was in a couple of years with him), and I had more hope than we had . <br /> <br /> The fans insisted that no high-level adventure would ever be taken seriously, so the "field" was the only way. Several other fans jumped on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the small event, Pal approached us and apologized, wishing he could do more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie to the flacks, and a year after the death of Pal, Spielberg and Lucas showed that Doc Savage could easily have been the next most important film franchise ... if it hadn't been for the flacks. <br /> <br /> Tearing away the memory or the history of Doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing but a senseless popcorn vendor. <br /> <br /> But destroying the legacy of that kind was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the cradle. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still get to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons of Indiana Jones ill-informed, but it should be done in all seriousness and sincerity to reclaim the glory we should expect from the American First Superhero. <br /> <br /> SIDENOTES: Yes, there was a second script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and it's much more serious. Yes, simultaneous shooting was shot, but mostly footage was shot and very little with actors. And yes, there's a sheet of Ron Ely that jumps over a brick wall and blasts something behind his shoulder with a purpose-built bronze gun. Ely wears a duster over a white shirt buttoned with a bronze tie, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the agents of the study who accompanied George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, slaps the idiots on the side of the head and call them idiots. At that time, they were doing dorkknobs and Fu Manchu in striped and loose-fitting canvas pants, and they wore Paramount's wallets.
