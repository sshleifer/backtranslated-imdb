VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a great disappointment! And although Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the script, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a film written in lead directed by the undisputed Buzz Kulik. First, the top turnover Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His performance in a note devoid of fire and taste that Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have interpreted. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed like a Mexican bandit who finds himself in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Moreover, the second turnover of Robert Mitchum is completely wasted in the picture! Its part as an ace of the biplane that makes throwing homemade bombs from the air for the revolution is a poorly written role that could have been interpreted by any minor star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the whole film and suggests that his other Mexican revolution depicts the much superior "Bandido" (1956) which unfortunately no one seems to have any interest in publishing on DVD. In addition to missing any kind of style "Villa Rides" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is the star Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum a happy eye, but her casting is simply superficial. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might have added a couple of notches absolutely necessary to the uncertain plot. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good action scenes in the film, but a couple of good action scenes make it not a film and the image quality of Panavision, less than perfect, besides the repetitive The motif by Maurice Jarre does not help make a difference. As is the Paramount, there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yes, a presentation of the film and the disappointing DVD that could have been and should have been much better.
