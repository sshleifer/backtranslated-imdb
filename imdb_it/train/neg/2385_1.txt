I saw this movie because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I'd try the sister, Rain Phoenix. I regret having verified it. It was embarrassing and the movie has this strange plot if that's what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean sits on a toilet that they both sleep with this old man in the mountains, what's going on? I've never been so dissatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe the actors agreed to waste films, money, time and space. If Sissy was "beautiful" she didn't catch me. I thought it was anything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if he can hitchhike? WHAT'S THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, too bad the poll doesn't have a 0, it doesn't even deserve a 1. I hope Rain is better in other films, I lose it for this performance, I mean I wouldn't do much better with that movie.
