Daraar started quite well. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Apart from that, the first half of the film is a total BORE. The whole first half of the film is about Rishi Kapoor falling madly in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her ??? <br /> <br /> Things finally start to get spicy towards the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about his previous husband; and wow what crazy he is! He was a too protective and clean freak with a really HOT TEMPERATURE! He used to beat poor Juhi without good reason! One of the reasons I don't really like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) being so abused. This film in general has MODI too abuse and bloodshed; I find it so disgusting !!! <br /> <br /> Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking of renting Daraar, you should put it back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!
