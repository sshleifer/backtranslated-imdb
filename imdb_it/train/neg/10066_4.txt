I saw it recently and there is another shorter version from 1999. I have the impression that they are the same film but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> One is Japanese and no pikachu is everything can come with. Why ever vote the same movie twice ?? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was rather boring. She seemed almost asleep, she didn't express the few jokes she had at all. <br /> <br /> It was quite fun but there wasn't much. <br /> <br /> A collector (who follows Lugia, does not intend to destroy the world) and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture Lugia causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> The following pokemon movies are slightly better, deoxys (poke 7) is fantastic, with no. 8 almost here.
