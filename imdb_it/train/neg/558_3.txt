It's been about 14 years since Sharon Stone rewarded the spectators with a passage of legs that twisted the minds of many people. And now, God knows why, it's back in the game. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the successful "Basic Instinct" erotic with a sexy Stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original may not even come close to this, since "Instinct 2" is a painful film, since the mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The film's plot begins when a car explosion breaks at the very beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, trying to look sexy) is suspected and seems to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is in charge of examining it, but eventually falls in love with a game of intimate seduction. <br /> <br /> And here, without further explanation, the fundamental force that drives this "Instinct". Not much is explained and we have to go through a bleak C-class erotic film. Sharon Stone is the protagonist in her first role in which it is almost always the turn-off. Partly because of amateur writing, careless direction and terrifying chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a scene with tris scenes was interrupted so that this would not have been classified NC-17) compared to the first entry of the series. "Instinct" is compelling torture. <br /> <br /> Finally, everything that made the original film a guilty pleasure is nowhere to be found in the film. The acting here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here, it becomes extremely hateful. David Morrisey plays the worst part of his life and never seems to do more than two expressions in the film - confused and excited. "Instinct 2" is a horrible way to continue an otherwise original series, which has managed to put very well into the thriller with the erotic. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" has never seemed like a good movie and, in fact, it is not. Some movies should never go out of paper, and this is the feeling you get after seeing this. Now, it's much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg have retired, and why Sharon Stone expected a huge paycheck for this ..........- 3/10
