OK, I took this movie halfway, ma.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially that boy who is now in Teachers and the book group, even if he has at least shown that he can act if he wishes! (the part where someone has a heart attack stands out as a bulwark of the ugly movie, both in terms of acting, screenplay and general plausibility) it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of sincere and hopeless GCSE students trying to get a vote. Not so much as Human Traffic as a car accident!
