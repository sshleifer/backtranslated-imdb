Darkly comical serendipity of a cosmetic saleswoman, with strange ties to Elvis Presley, who runs into a sea of ​​Elvis imitators while talking at conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them because of her. Kim Basinger, an attractive actress of considerable importance, loves to choose bizarre movies to act, but this terrible script (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) doesn't have a shred of good humor. Stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classical comedy, but even in terms of shame, shame, the picture is rough and sloppy. If you look, see if you can count how many extraneous strokes there are of Basinger at the wheel of his pink Cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-bruised look on his face. I hope both you and Elvis have been well paid. NO STARS from ****
