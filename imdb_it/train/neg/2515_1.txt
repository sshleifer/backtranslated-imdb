This film is an abomination and its creation should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of cinema is why no one has ever made a faithful film adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It's a story of a truly compelling mystery, a beautiful old-fashioned love story and dry English humor. Because the producers have had to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant, change the main plot part about the murder charge and the circumstances of Gordon's fight to save the defendant etc. etc.? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the book should write the original script themselves and not rape another person's product.
