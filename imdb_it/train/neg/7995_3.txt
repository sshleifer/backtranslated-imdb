I remember watching this film when I was young, but I couldn't remember the title to it then going through the horror movies I find it and I think to myself "is this the title?" This film is a kind of catastrophic film / insect attack film combination with fewer notable stars in it. It's also a bit boring, since it has that atmosphere of television where you can see the fading of the film by advertising and so on. The plot has this type of resort that is invaded by ants. I think they were a little bothered by the construction or something happening nearby, but don't mention it. The most memorable attack of the ant for me throughout the film was the first to involve the child falling into the pool after being swarmed and, of course, also the Summers attack scene. What stands out in this is the stupid ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end though, like most television movies, this film is very docile and not very scary, at least unless you panic at the sight of ants.
