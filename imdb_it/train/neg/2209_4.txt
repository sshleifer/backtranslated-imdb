If you read my review of "Dinoshark" by SyFy, you know that I can appreciate the low-cost schlock that these television-made films can provide. They are stupid ... they are stupid ... but they are still quite funny in a "so bad, it's good" way. So, always with a sense of guilt for having liked (and recommended) the undeniable hokey "Dinoshark", I sat down to watch "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", an original SyFy movie on a half-man and half-hammer monster terrorizing people on an island. With the safe SyFy Channel recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it really lacks the mark ... not by much, but enough to make me advise against. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, the feared human-hammer-head hybrid, takes over a group of fake-military thugs who really become the main villain of the film. Even if the hammerhead accumulates the count of the body, he (or it or whatever you call the thing) arrives only shortly before someone is chewed and leaves immediately afterwards. The rest of the film is full, putting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. This, for me, is not as compelling as watching a walking hammer eating people! <br /> <br /> Please read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
