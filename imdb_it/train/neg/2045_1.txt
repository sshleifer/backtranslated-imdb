This film must have been the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her boyfriend went to rent Zodiac (2007) and took it by mistake. I thought it was a joke before the movie itself. this was terrible that I was waiting for him to fear and never happened. this movie had no real facts about the real Zodiac killer. The filmmakers didn't even bother to look for anything on the murders ... they just liked the name ... so they decided to write a script about anything true to its name. I'm angry that I didn't realize it wasn't the film before. I try to love something from every movie, I don't hate movies ... never ... except this one. If I could not have given stars, I would certainly have done it. 1 in 10.
