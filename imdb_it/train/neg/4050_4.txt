This is a fairly obsolete film that aims to show the yearning of youth for freedom in an inhuman English school. Oh yes it is like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you are asked to do. Yes, the young dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and wipes out their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. <br /> <br /> Basically this is how you could summarize If's good intentions ... The good intentions that don't give rise to cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory film. See how bored I am? <br /> <br /> At least that old game helped Kubrick play McDowell in A Clockwork Orange, a film with a very powerful social satire and self-indulgent sentimentality.
