The predictable parody, almost failed to impress throughout the film in eight minutes. The only thing that was worth it was the DO NOT COLORIZE line to the end credits. Too bad that something more fun was not included on the DVD, like the enjoyable profile of Romero by Jonathan Ross in "The Incredible Strange Film Show".
