Hard to call The Grudge a horror movie. At best it blew me away from the surprise in a couple of moments. <br /> <br /> If you forget the (scary) frightening dimension and look at the other aspects of the film, you are disappointed again. The acting is OK but not exceptional. The story can be quite interesting in the beginning, while one is trying to get what is happening. But towards the end we understand that there is not much to understand. Sometimes the "scary" elements have been added to the script for no reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) See this movie if you have nothing more interesting to do, like cutting carrots or looking at the clouds.
