Oh man, this movie always bites! If you've ever been afraid of seeing a slasher remake, done as cheaply as possible and cautious at the same time (compatible with the PC, it doesn't mean nudity, a classic element of slasher movies) Cut and that's it. Each clich√© is reconstructed without a hint of self-awareness and acting. Oh, acting redefines the word horror. I should have known better, as the direct Dutch translation of the title would tip me.
