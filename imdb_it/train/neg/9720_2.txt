This film is simply boring. <br /> <br /> Try to copy some effects borrowed from a creative director like Jeunet in "Am√©lie Poulain", but it's too much. The dialogues are pretty ugly, some of the worst I've ever heard, Guillaume Canet is not convincing (I almost never found it very convincing), his father plays very badly in the film, the story is stupid, the ending is ... stupid . <br /> <br /> I think I no longer dislike a movie since "le pacte des loups" (brotherhood of the wolf) by Christophe Gans (and I watch / see about 80-100 films a year), but at least that movie had some action and many good actors. <br /> <br /> I had never commented here (only evaluated), and when I saw the evaluation and comments, I thought I should write something down. <br /> <br /> I think we won't have problems selling the DVD that was offered to us: it's not a bad movie in our (big) collection !!! <br /> <br /> I am open-minded (I watch SF movies, westerns, dramas, comedies, silences, horror, fantasy ...), but this film was so boring that I felt like I lost a hour and a half.
