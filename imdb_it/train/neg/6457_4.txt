I guess I've seen worse movies, but it could be because I'm so tired of how bad these horror movies are. The thing about the killer monster is really bad, it's basically a guy in a kind of green suit. There is much worse in the acting of the film B, but don't think that for a second this was something stellar, hell no. He actually had a plot with substance, but it was still pretty stupid. It's basically just a bad low-budget horror movie. But at least it's not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, this sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. Here is a complaint I have about the whole horror of the new millennium, low grade, looks stupid. A good creepy death scene with really fake blood is so stupid. At least there was a nice shower scene
