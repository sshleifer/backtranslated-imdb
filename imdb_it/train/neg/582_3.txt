Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights on human nature, in particular on the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction in turning and turning and turning around everything, making the viewer rather sick. Because the director has not put an end to this is beyond me - but perhaps he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to get good performances from these normally excellent but improperly fused actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours should be better spent reading (or re-reading) the book.
