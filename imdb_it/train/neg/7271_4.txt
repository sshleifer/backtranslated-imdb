This could be the gay counterpart of Gone With The Wind given its epic length, but instead it is satisfied being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. The characters are one-dimensional and have no other development in the story (not even a story) than looking for each other and kissing each other. It is a pity that an interesting aesthetic proposal like having almost no dialogue is completely wasted in a film of no effort whatsoever in examining the psychology of its characters with a certain dignity and obtaining a true emotional resonance. Furthermore, he pretends to be an "art" film using the worst naive clich√©s of cinematic snobbery. But anyway, if someone can identify with his heavy banality, I guess that's fine.
