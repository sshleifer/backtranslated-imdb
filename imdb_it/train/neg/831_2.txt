To live! Yes, but don't kick. <br /> <br /> True story: some time ago a Dutch television station announced that they were about to air a new reality show. A competition rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and would have given her kidneys to a lucky person with progressive kidney failure. For real. <br /> <br /> The country and the international media have told this story like flies on an asshole, saying it was terrifying, immoral, what is this coming world, and the like. In a sense, I had to agree. <br /> <br /> As the months went by, the tension accumulated to such an extent that the government was mostly occupied by whether or not to let this show go, instead of managing the country. <br /> <br /> The show aired and until the last moment they were going forward. And until the last moment the country was in arms, the Prime Minister gave speeches, every newspaper wrote about it, everyone in the country held their breath. And the network has continued. Towards a new frontier on television. And surely they managed to do just that. They pushed the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show aired and we all saw a terminally ill woman who selected the right candidate to receive her kidneys, so he or she would live while she would die shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney rod. The entire show, which with advertising and publicity and all the discussions, built for months until a fantastic climax, was an advertisement to focus attention on the problem of the major shortages of organ donors. The man who founded this particular network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now THIS is television. Leaving everyone far behind in amazement. <br /> <br /> Don't give me a misinterpreted and misdirected video about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette show on American TV. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * As if you were to believe that they would get this through the FCC. As if I intended to believe that this would pass through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I believed in the ridiculous ending in which this woman took him off and has conscience problems because someone shot himself in the air. <br /> <br /> It has already been done before. Look instead at Running Man with Arnold. At least it had a semi-satisfying ending. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terribly ugly film, along with a ridiculous ending. So in the end she gets hit, is this what should make us make a public film after we leave the theater because there was a kind of justice? Don't believe me, but I would say this: leave this alone and look at a test model instead, you will get more quality.
