I don't often distribute "one", but if there's ever been a movie that deserved this kind of attention, it's "Gas!" This is a self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the atmosphere of M * A * S * H ​​and falls completely flat on his face in the attempt. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman was looking for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's deathless role in the original film version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the movie "Whiffs" - look for it here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marmorstein and Gould approached the brass ring with "Whiffs" that Corman made with "Gas!" but we haven't really arrived. Neither film has approached the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with "Gas!"? What is not? No one comes close to really acting at a higher level than middle school. Production values ​​stink. Someone else mentioned the headlights that magically regenerate an escape car, and there's more to it than the lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as it should in this film, and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to sleep It's not a safe cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "Last year at Marienbad" and the remake of "Solaris" by George Clooney (which was remarkable for being more boring than the original by Mosfilm, despite the apparent lack of familiarity with the idea of ​​maintaining public attention with judicious editing). br /> <br /> Judicious editing would have decimated "Gas!" at about twenty minutes. The result would be useless, but no more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they have an irresistible quality that still makes them worth watching. This is not one of them. Do not waste time. It's not even fun.
