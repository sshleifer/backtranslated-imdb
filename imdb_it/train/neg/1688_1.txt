Damn, what a bad movie it was! I can't understand what people find so scary about "The Grudge". The director plays a trick (I should admit it very well, that comes to life very stylized) and then repeats it for the rest of the film over and over again. As a result, I jumped a couple of times in the first quarter of the film, but once I got to know the drill, I practically fell asleep when The Grudge became more and more predictable from minute to minute. To conclude, I can say that there are much better films in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor "The Ring" was much scarier and that buying a ticket for "The Grudge" is a waste of money.
