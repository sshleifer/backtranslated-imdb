{rant start} At first I didn't want to believe it, but I think this is what people talk about when they say that South Korean cinema has peaked and could even go downhill. After the surprising and moving film of monsters "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host") of 2006 - which actually managed to make a clear satire from a genre of film B - successive Korean successes have become increasingly generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become increasingly fantastic. Do South Korean filmmakers really want to squander all the public and investor goodwill, which their sector has accumulated since the 1999 opening film "Shiri / Swiri", making a whole series of mediocre big-budget films like Mainland China? {rant end} <br /> <br /> The only "reason" I can imagine to make this film is to trick investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean / Oriental Asian style dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes. Now, if they had first introduced that dragon and given it more personality and purpose than in the "Dragonheart" of 1996, the film could have had some other redeeming qualities besides having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember "Dungeons & Dragons" in 2000? No one has learned that makeup is not the way MUCH special effects are used, but how well is it used? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends that they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in the legends of the Korean dragon with the way they filmed this. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with all the previous negative reviews and wonder how the Koreans felt about having their folk song "Arirang" played at the end. As a feature of a creature, I would have given at least 5 out of 10 stars if the special effects or action sequences were worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera operation and scripts (only fewer dragons).
