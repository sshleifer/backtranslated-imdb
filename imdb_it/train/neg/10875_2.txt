I saw this "movie" recently and I must say that it was the worst attempt to make films that I have ever had the misfortune to see. What the hell was going on in Coolio? Totally unprovoked shots against people in danger. Totally uninvolving, slow, boring and aloof. Worse than Spawn. viva "Evil dead II".
