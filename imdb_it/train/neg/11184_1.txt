This is a really terrible movie. I only write this so that some people are discouraged looking at it. If I had prevented a person from wasting part of their precious life watching this movie, I will die happy. <br /> <br /> Unusually boring, even though Al Pacino has been a protagonist since I starred in thinking that at any moment something interesting was about to happen. Then the credits came, and I realized that I had been completely fooled into looking at this incredible rise. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this film has achieved the highest IMDb score (over 5 stars when I last saw the vote). Do people vote ironically? <br /> <br /> Please, please, please do not watch this movie!
