This film is not terrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is the type of snicker of American Europeans. But there are those, and not necessarily the Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do not care about the French; and the character of Xavier will not affect them. <br /> <br /> Let us consider its stereotyped French attributes: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynic - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, a malnourished appearance, controls, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great appreciation of the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Ethics of lukewarm work. Check. (Forget the fact that he is supposedly a wealthy stockbroker, from watching him in the movie he seems to be putting in ten working hours a week.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite this: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage vows. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). A great sexual ego, which says that an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check it out. <br /> <br /> Whether Mo is an idiot or not, there is no reason for her to fall in love with this stupid European idiot except what the script says. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, like other male reviewers, I enjoyed seeing the cute and tiny body of Karen Allen. I will give the film four stars; two of them are for that.
