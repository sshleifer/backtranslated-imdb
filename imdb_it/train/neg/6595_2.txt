I put this film in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had put all their toys away. (The little ones don't like watching "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") My four years found a funny scene, but they told me that the rest was "too silly". This is a FOUR YEARS, folks. Anyone over the age of nineteen will want to kill their television rather than let this reproduce. <br /> <br /> To say that this film is ugly is like saying that the Holocaust was a small mistake. There are no words for how ridiculous and absolutely terrible this "movie" is. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid and the script is pathetically not funny. Since this should be a comedy, the fact that you can't even laugh at the malice of the film makes it even worse. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is the worst with some weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-bronx-cockney-cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are horrible. I haven't seen a real Laurel or Hardy movie for ages, but I know they had to be a lot better than that. What is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with ... this? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: derivative garbage. Avoid at all costs unless you have a Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
