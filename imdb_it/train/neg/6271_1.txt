There are no words to explain how bad the NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. Simply challenge the description. Something on a computer that can change personal items into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, kill them or turn them into zombies. The whole thing is so amazing that it's incredible. There is also a girl with a personal computer in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like machines, even if there is nothing to connect the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> The "film" is total garbage. Surreal garbage. Spectacular, a bad rubbish unique in its kind. There are a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which are not very hot or erotic. There is also a scene in which a woman seems to make love or wants to kiss a French tarantula, who made me roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of the worst films ever made. Up there with the equally inconvenient direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever's going on.
