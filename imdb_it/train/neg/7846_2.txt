You know, I went to see "The hills have eyes 2" that they want to like. I really liked the original and the remake was pretty fun. Obviously they had more money to spend than Wes Craven for special effects the second time. Although I still prefer the original film, the remake was done well, and it was a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and large special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Friend, where do I start? The plot, or the lack of one, is very thin. We are not exactly opening new horizons here. The military has decided to monitor the area, and all these people have disappeared. So what do we do now? We send the National Guard to investigate. In the real Hollywood fashion we need to make them the stupidest and worst soldiers ever seen. Damn, I've never seen that premise before. In short, you have mutants that kill idiots one by one in a graphical way. Once again Nicotero's special effects are great, but the killings don't matter how boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this shot was made just to grab a quick dollar. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring and not scary. For me it would have been nice if this film contained an original thought. We Craven and his son shared writing duties, and have been involved in many of my favorite horror films, but unfortunately it's not one of them.
