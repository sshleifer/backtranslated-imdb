A long-awaited film .. But he disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day .. From the trailers it looked like an action movie, but it turned out to be a comedy out & out (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves to be appreciated is the acting of these professional actors, they did their part of the film very well. Good acting, but I don't think he can save the film. India was filmed wonderfully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) They were all saturated with colors, okay. However the way the intrinsic beauty of these places was filmed made me want to find out exactly where those places were and when I could go there ;-) <br /> <br /> The action sequences were filmed in very shabby way, no one could out head & tail of the stunts, they used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but could have been done much better .. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I've seen in the recent films (The films of the 90s had better animation scenes, I imagine (the opening scene in which the car is falling "flying should be a better word" the road to the lake). <br /> <br /> E the name of the film was mentioned almost every 20-30 min, just to be sure that the public does not forget the name of the film, I guess ..
