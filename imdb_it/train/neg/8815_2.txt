Yes, I'm just going to tell you about this, so don't read if you want surprises. I took this with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD titled Silent Night, Bloody Night. Considering that Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had a lot of potential and was very close to being good, this was not as good. It started out interesting enough to watch the villain (if you can call him that) by looking at the kids in the neighborhood and writing in books about who's bad and funny, but after a while you're looking for some action and this movie isn't being released. You need character development, but this is exaggerated and you're never sure why the guy is shooting. About an hour ago he kills three or four people while a whole crowd looks terrified, and the boys he kills are not even his targets, they are just teasing him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock on the villain. Then he proceeds to try to kill the other boy, and tries to enter his house hugging himself in the fireplace. He hangs up quickly and can barely get out. He then enters the basement and then tries to kill the boy by choking him in his bedroom. He can't kill the boy this way, so he grabs a star from the tree and cuts the boys to their throats. First, what on earth was a tree that even did in the bedroom? Oh yes, the killer before this killing stopped at a party and he enjoyed it too. Well, that's all except for the people of the city who chase him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that melody he wants to play. What was it? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How do you end up wondering, well since I have spoilers that I'll tell you. He runs off the road in his van and proceeds, well, lets just say he was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
