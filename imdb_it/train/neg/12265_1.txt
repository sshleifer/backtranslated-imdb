The special effects of this film are, above all for its time, laughable and used in such an emphasized way that one cannot deny their terrible existence. <br /> <br /> Acting redefines the term "terrible exaggeration" at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul, where Julie Newman and Andrew Divoff redefine "bad guys". <br /> <br /> *** spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The fascination in this film can be found in two things: the first is the excellent casting of Carel "Lurch" Struycken in clothes of the mysterious psychic Gaunt, who can sense where and when people will die and is always there. <br /> <br /> The latter are original finds, the SF-Western combination is obviously original, if terrible, but other finds are more original, like the gunslinger Zack Stone who is able to perceive the pain of the people he shoots (although his acting is lower here). > <br /> Overal ... don't see this movie, unless you love that old and brutal Carel Struycken, as any self-respecting Dutch should.
