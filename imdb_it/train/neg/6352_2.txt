I have always been a big fan of Woody Allen and I will always be so for most of what he has done in the past, but only a blind lover could ignore how boring, insignificant, pretentious and above all horribly this film is. A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent reasons. And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate an alleged "clone actor of Allen", who is putting in Will Farrell's mouth and hints at what Allen would have done instead of Farrell if he was 30 years younger. The result was obviously ridiculous. And not to mention the dialogues ... what was thought to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual reflection, unaware of its comic effect. How sad ...
