Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the superiors in his country to subsidize this misleading attempt at a movie. The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of the attempt to make a film with such a thin material. Most of the images taken in Spain fall into two categories: those on the Spanish Civil War, which like to present past history as writers deem appropriate. The other type of film shows the viewer a lot of free sex because the "creators" have nothing to say. <br /> <br /> As the film opens, we see Pere's penis trying to cut it and put it in one of the trays of a party. Later, Sandra will show everything that was given to the public to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman who seems to be happily married, is false from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Our only interest in watching the film is centered on a previous, better-made picture of Mr. Pons, "Amic / Amat", but alas, it has nothing to do with the mess we're punished to look into this undertaking. As for the comments presented in IMDb, all the negative votes come from Spanish viewers, who talk about their volumes!
