Funny that I find myself forced to review this film, but here I am. I'm reviewing it, because just recently I had the chance to witness the rebirth of R.C. Sheriff plays "Journey's End" on the New York stage, at the Belasco Theater, with Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley. <br /> <br /> I left the film theater shattered. I'm not exaggerating, I was amazed. After almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic representation of the soldier's life in the trenches of the Somme (hypothesize), during the First World War, brought back to life vividly by all those involved, I left the theater with the shakes. <br /> <br /> Please, I'm not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I myself am a theater actor and a director, so I know that buttons are pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally and psychologically. <br /> <br /> But what I had just witnessed, came so much to life, that I had chills in my spine as I left. <br /> <br /> None of these emotions came to life while watching "Aces High", the film based on this game and also adapted for the screen, in collaboration with RC The Sheriff himself, shortly before he died. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of the screen takes place in the skies above France. Thus, the claustrophobic atmosphere to begin with is over. <br /> <br /> The only advantage of the film, are the aerial battle scenes, which seem dated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid in the flight tactics adopted on the screen. <br /> <br /> Assuming there had been a couple of film adaptations of "All Quiet on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in the trenches, and not in the sky, but that was the German "vision "on things, if one would like to be picky about these things. <br /> <br /> "Journey's End" is just the other side of the coin, and would have turned it into a great movie, if they had left it alone and intact. <br /> <br /> The transfer to DVD is poor, although in Widescreen and adapted for 16: 9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a cinema. Nothing more, nothing less. It shows off various defects, such as small scratches and stitches, even if the copy is otherwise clean. <br /> <br /> If you want another World War I movie in your collection, especially for those who love and love seeing veteran air battles, then this is a picture for you. But I would prefer to suggest "Von Richthofen and Brown" as an alternative, although this is a film full of inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> For the rest of you, who enjoy acting and drama, I would like to start this out. Buy the game. Go see the play if you have the chance to get a decent revival of this near you, but keep close to this adaptation. <br /> <br /> It is a film against war, granted, but the weakest I have ever seen in my life ever. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, as they are seen very weakly and very short cameo roles throughout the film. <br /> <br /> McDowell, the talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, offer very weak performances, not because of their lack of skill, but rather for lack of truth and solid direction. <br /> <br /> There are too many gaps in it, and as mentioned before, it drags towards the dubious end. Doubts because in the original comedy none of the men we meet and sympathize with remains alive. They are all killed in a fatal and futile mission. Everyone in the film dies, except for Malcolm McDowell, who somehow manages to stay alive another day, being the winged commander of the unfortunate group, only to receive three more pilots to fly and die for another lost cause. <br /> <br /> The end of the game leaves a naked stage in total darkness. You just hear the guns roar, the noise of machine guns and the impacts of grenades throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain rises. Lights. And here they are all. Aligned, straight and rigid. Obedient corpses ... <br /> <br /> Much more interesting and much more shocking than the end of "Aces High", which is also dragged by the hair. <br /> <br /> It's up to you to judge. <br /> <br /> For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do it, I would like to take the game and develop it, the way it was intended. Adding here and there some action scenes in the field, only to visualize the "external" horror and the massacre taking place in the "vast fields of France", around the men involved, but then, focusing only strictly on what is happening, in that little "shack" on the edge of sanity and the world ... <br /> <br /> Do you want a film like that? <br /> <br /> So ask for it. <br /> <br /> This is not it.
