I saw the comment of the "great acting" capsule. In my opinion, these are two great actors who give horrible performances, and no chemistry between them, for a great director in his worst effort of all time. Robert De Niro must be the most brilliant and intelligent illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance shifts uncomfortably across the map, as it clearly has no influence on this character, especially since the character is so badly written. Molasses-like would be an adjective too fast for the atrocious rhythm of the film. Although the intent of the film is to be an edifying story of illiteracy, observing it is a real "fiasco". I give 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 films for its budget level I've ever seen.
