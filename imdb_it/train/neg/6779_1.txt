There is a high level of expectation when sitting down to watch a play with a cast directed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further amplified when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations could be met and then ??. Anything. What should be a light comedy, plunges into a heavy and heavy melodrama, with a chuckle that can't be done. <br /> <br /> The newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or for the lack of one, in this film, but in a film in which even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and in wood , attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even as bright a light as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this sinuous, bleak and totally useless script, which drags on and carries the viewer's interest and patience. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, continues to try to breathe some life into the process, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation. The desperate, vain attempt to drag a laugh with a numb heart in the last moments of the film only serves to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This film is a great disappointment at all levels.
