I read reviews that apparently have to be a student in a very strict British school in the 60s to understand this. Perhaps it is true, if so, then this film is obsolete. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The ending makes more sense than all the children who are anti-governmental and anti-corporate without having a better solution that does not torment the company to a Mad Max type ash. <Br /> <br /> Yes, the main characters might leave, but they don't. The reasons why they go about this make no sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What a group of innocents shoots should mean it is never explained or even hinted at. It is said that war is the final creative expression, probably the only revelation that all the characters in this film have, and it makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Characters going into a homicidal campaign are not fighting the institution, they are just killing people. I thought they could use all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, which would have had a greater symbolic meaning, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> tl; dr - This film is the adolescent's daydream of fighting against the authority that afflicts them, even if they actually need it. It has no moral truth, symbolic or meaning; this film simply plays the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" who annoy you. <br /> <br /> If you think that a murder goes off / shooting at school in a similar way to the columbina or virginia technology, it's a rational and reasonable way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like, so I think you'll love this movie . If you are like me and you are working to make a life for yourself instead of blindly (very blindly in this film) that rebels against "man", this film is youthful and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also tell in parts that the funding was missing, and the story seemed to have a slight deficit of attention. <br /> <br /> All in all, it looks like a very rough draft of what could have been a good movie, but no effort is put into dialogue, character development or morality, so it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If ... I could only get my two hours back.
