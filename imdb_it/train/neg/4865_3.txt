I didn't like this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in the city and I was spoiled talking about animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not nice. They were all annoying, especially Chris Rock's guinea pig, but then what I could expect, is Chris Rock. I think I smiled once or twice in a couple of nice lines, but that's all.
