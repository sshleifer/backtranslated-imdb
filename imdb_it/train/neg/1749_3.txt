I must say that this was the worst priyadarshan film (releasing along with many other kyonki which was also his directorial undertaking), does not contain a specific plot and focuses only on the body that shows the novice actresses and some stupid comic sequences. I think the priyadarshan is becoming too repetitive in his comedy films just as Govinda and David Dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers, but they also lost their audience. So it will be better for him to focus more on the script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of herapheri and weekly malamal than giving bridesmaids as garam masala!
