I didn't see the original, but I just wanted to drop a short note to anyone who happens to scroll here: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or go back in time to tell me not to see it. <br /> <br /> I will give you two positive signs: the sarcasm of Cage's character has at least some laughter from me and the scenery of the island was beautiful. Sorry, that's all. The jokes are coming. The plot of the film is projected forward only because the other characters will not give Cage direct answers - and he endures it !!! How this could go on for over an hour of my time (much less days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is full of holes. Leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. Like anyone can read this script and think, "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this shady outline of what a film should look like" is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't go see this movie. Or even rent it on DVD.
