There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this movie. Let's face it, though, the main reasons why someone would see that it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they were smelly in this movie. The special effects were decent (and I will say that the directors did a good job making the ship pleasant), but IT also has several major flaws. For example, just before the ship goes below, you can see an incomplete blue-screen image behind your main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of REAL Titanic, but I find this film an insult to that story. The editing was atrocious - there's no reason why a film lasts more than two and a half hours (with the exception of MAYBE, a biographical film), and the script and script were horribly rigged. <br /> <br /> I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have foreseen (and not just the song "My Heart Will Go On"). There is a scene that strikes me when the ship is sinking and the bass music is heard. This could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood, it was extremely boring. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know can't be what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, I find it horrible that they would turn the beautiful story of the Titanic into a throwing chick.
