What was an exciting and quite original series by Fox has turned into a meandering tripe. During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list, and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers on Fox have decided that they needed to "fine tune" the plot. In 3 episodes of the beginning of the season, they had totally lost me as a spectator (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters added in the second season too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plots were extending the continuity and credibility of the show too subtle. In one of the episodes of the second season, they also had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated that she could not sleep biologically. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't torment yourself! <br /> <br /> azjazz
