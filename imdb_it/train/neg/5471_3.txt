Typical Troma-trash, this stunning 1980s film is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's well-known production studio, along with "The Toxic Avenger" published a year earlier. "The Toxic Avenger" is far superior if you ask me, but this crazy-crushing is still bearable; make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small city that proudly claims to be the toxic chemical capital of the world, and they certainly don't lie. Safety precautions in the local nuclear power plant are below minimum standards (even Homer Simpson has never been so casual) and toxic waste enters the nearby high school. The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical nerd, who starts gushing green stuff from all the cavities of his body, but his death is considered an accident because he had no less than two microwave ovens in his house! Oh humanity! Shortly thereafter, however, the nuclear leaks also affect the school's weed plantation and it really starts to get messy. After smoking a joint at a party, the prettiest couple at school make a giant worm monster that settles in the basement and feeds on teenage scum. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is the horror film from the back of the coffin, with dialogues so stupid as to hurt the ears and make-up effects that give a completely new meaning to the word "tasteless". If you like looking at faces that melt, crushed or split in half, this is a must see! Unlike the already mentioned "The Toxic Avenger", this film suffers from a couple of really boring and too long moments in which nothing really significant happens, such as when Chrissy and Warren try to understand what's wrong with the their hormones. Rough humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the performances are inexcusably amateur. Only proceed if you are a passionate Troma fanatic.
