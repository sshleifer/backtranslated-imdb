A pale shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, uselessly "opens it" and confuses the thrust of the show. The show is about a group of dancers who do auditions for a job in a B'way musical and examine their desire and desire to work in this demanding and not always gratifying line of work. Attenborough gives us a fresh cast of hope, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in the entertainment world, rather than presenting the most gray mix of characters created on stage as a group of "gypsies" who live shows to show , along with a couple of newcomers. The film has an advantage over the game and this is the opening scene, showing the size of the original audition and the true narrowing scale until 16/17 on the line (depending on how Cassie, who is foolishly kept out of the line in the film). Anyone able to capture a local civic light opera production will have a much richer experience than seeing this ill-conceived film.
