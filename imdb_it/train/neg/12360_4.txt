Because a person should come back to a person who kicks them, not once, not twice, but again and again. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us that to find love we must accept abuse (not only forgive it, but accept it fully). Wow! No wonder my first relationship lasted only ten years. Obviously I wasn't hugging my inner masochist. <br /> <br /> Like Bucatinsky's screenplay debut, there are many wonderful aspects to this film; however, to justify the meeting of Eli and Tom, more character development would have been useful. We are never aware of Eli's masochism, in fact, we are led to believe that he is not a masochist, although Tom's psycho-emotional sadism is very evident.
