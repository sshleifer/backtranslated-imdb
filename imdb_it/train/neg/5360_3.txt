"Nada" was the most inadequate sequel to "Les NOces Rouges" which, with the benefit of hindsight, now appears as the last beautiful film of the golden age of Chabrol (1967-1973) "Nada" is the first Chabrol's real attempt at an entirely political film, his previous work "les Noces Rouges" also had political elements but was more of a psychological thriller with the usual look at society in the French provinces. "Nada" includes terrorists, ambassadors, hostage-taking, lots of blood, not really Chabrol field. A heterogeneous cast gives the film the coup de grace: only Duchaussoy, who had already played with the director, and Maurice Garrel are up to it. Viviane Romance, one of Duvivier's actresses ("La Belle Equipe" "Panique"), is wasted as a lady (Gabrielle). The Italian actors (Fabio Testi, Lou Castel) are horrible. <br /> <br /> With "Nada" this is a second period of despicable inspiration for Chabrol. It would be "Violette Nozi√®res" before being back on top of his game.
