If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely awful movie with no movie plot, it makes no sense of what is happening. Just PLAN THE TREE. Please don't waste your money on this. Pleaseee !!! This film could have done so well if it really represented the story of the real killer of the zodiac, but I didn't feel disgusted as I watched it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies, it's best to watch a movie you've seen 3-4 times of watching this shit! I don't understand why people worry about making movies like that when they know it won't go well. The killer of the zodiac should instead be called "assassin of the Boriac" !!!
