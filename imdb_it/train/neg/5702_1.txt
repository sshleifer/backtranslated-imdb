What a disappointment! I hated mom but this was even worse! It was very tiring and unbelievable and at one point I found myself sighing and yawning all the time. I can't believe people liked this movie. The role of Nicholas Cage was not very convincing. The whole movie looked like a great tour of America's most sought after buildings. The uninterrupted flow of suggestions and combinations was not very convincing. I stopped paying attention for about 30 minutes. What was supposed to be a happy evening became a total disappointment. What a drag ... I guess I've seen too many movies to enjoy the national treasure.
