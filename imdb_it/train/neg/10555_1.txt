First of all: I love good Splattermovies and I'm not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget film is nothing! The image quality is so darn low, the soundtrack is the most annoying I've ever heard (!!!!), and as for the FX ... well, the super low quality makes some of them not so bad like they would in a real movie (the one that isn't this junk here). No idea, a thin plot like a wafer, a primitive recitation and a rare dialogue - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole film, each repeated about 20 times ... the same for many movie sequences (it could be a indication for what kind of audience this crap was made !!!) The story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, he was psychologically damaged and as an adult he goes on tour, performing in a show of self-mutilation. So far, so good ... But for these pseudo-arctic directors, this plot is just a line to stage low-cost shock scenes that have neither a message nor any sense (newly removed intestines are thrown on a woman naked and tied in a hole in the earth ... why ?? and why is it the only time you see both the woman and the pitcher in all the bloody "movie" ??? Disturbing? Yup!! Sick? Yup!! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO!!!!! Everyone should exchange with their psychiatrist as soon as possible or see "The Wall" by Pink Floyd to see how a similar topic can be creatively worked out ... I hope this was your first and last movie (!!! !!!!!), Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all the bloody heads out there, remember: not everything that seems cheap and obviously doesn't make any sense is automatically "Art" ...
