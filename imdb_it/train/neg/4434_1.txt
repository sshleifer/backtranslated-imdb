I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delicious piece of history. What I got was a piece of pure junk. This film has been confused in most points, rippled in almost every point and terrible in all points. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen who played a young male scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been deprived of his knighthood even by considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to playing Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter films are more fun than this thing they call a play in a movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography seems that a university boy took a lesson in Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost all the scenes in the film are crushed for a sort of effect; the end result is obviously the most exaggerated piece of text I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost as good as Agis; pity he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling does her best as the almost naive lady waiting. In the end, I really wish Blockbuster Video had paid back. I'm so glad I didn't spend $ 10 looking at this fiasco in the theater. If they played this Marivaux comedy from the 18th century, I wonder how many people over the centuries have had their best naps during this work. If I had been there, they wouldn't have heard the snoring game. Thank goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip boring or horrible scenes. Guess it means that I just looked at the beginning and the end!
