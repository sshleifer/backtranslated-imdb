Unless you are a mentally ill or a harder rye fan you will get tired of this horrible excuse for a movie in less than 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> The Plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is simply stupid. I mean it's not just bad, it's barely consistent. <br /> <br /> The Acting - Incredibly wooden. Literally best seen acting in porn. Ironically, this film tries to cash in on this audience that a "lesbian love scene" that is absolutely worthy. <br /> <br /> Special effects - it wouldn't look out of place in a sword and sorcery of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other treatments, do not make the same mistake I made and buy this DVD, as I will ask you for an hour and a half of your life.
