A truly terrible French-Canadian co-production, the always wonderful Rosanna Arquette plays an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - some years before the action "the child murdered her father, and the mother took her fall to the offspring She is now transferred to the north-western United States to start over, but her son still has a problem as he is devoted to his mother, so devout indeed that he kills anyone who can be seen as a threat to their bond . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Mandy Schaeffer (like her daughter) kills more than people - offers such a terrible performance that she also cleans the film, even if the script is inconsistent, the direction is useless and the music is terrifying (see saxophone the first time he shows his bikini in bikini) they don't help you, we should find it sexy and scary, but it fails on both fronts, almost completely not alarming and not even brutal enough to be funny (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer don't really convince as mother and daughter), all condolences to Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both worthy of much more than this, and both (particularly Rosanna) are the the only reasons why anyone can sit in this farce. <br /> <br /> One of the production companies is called Quality International Films - not from the three hours "Love, Lies And Murder" (from Two Short Productions) there was a credit "You have to joke".
