I went to this movie expecting it to be really terrible. And it was. I felt really sorry for the star cast - Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this film - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual but Miranda Richardson couldn't put in one of the fabulous shows I know and love it for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (of the fame of Vicar of Dibley, among others), had about one joke. <br /> <br /> The plot was predictable and everywhere, and the humor was ... lacking. (However, there was a part of the movie in which Babbo enters the house of a Jewish family ... which made me laugh just because their expressions were classic). Don't see this movie unless your only other alternative is to have a head-on collision with a train (actually maybe the train would be better ...)
