This US soap opera, "Knots Landing" has all the entertainment value of being trapped in an elevator. Each episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling, not much different from the plots of other theatrical performances of the period. As for the cast, I saw better actors in a cereal box. From the middle to the end of the 90s, the repetitions of "Knots" were astonished on U.K-Gold as a mountain of moldy diapers. I'm sorry to announce that I had to suffer because my mother was a big fan of the show and looked at her religiously. Although since then, the re-runs have been few and far between (we hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said about "Knots" is the signature melody of the catchy saxophone, later used as music for the title of the sitcom I.T.V, "The Upper Hand". Great legacy, eh?
