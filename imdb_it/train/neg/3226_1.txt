We have reached the implausibility limit with this film. In practice, the dinosaurs get on board this ship piloted by a strange old fart named Neweyes (which I needed after watching this film). Apparently, Neweyes feels the desires of children all over the world and decides that it should grant the children's desire that the Dinosaurs be brought in modern times to be seen by all for a shameless exploitation. Dinosaurs eat this stuff that makes them smarter (Too bad the writers don't have it). By the way, it seems strange that on ALL the wishes of children in the world, Neweyes gives the desire to bring Dinosaurs to modern times? Why not grant the children's willingness to stop the famine? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Neweyes has nothing better to do with all this power than he has ??? Finally, when dinosaurs come to modern times, they begin to sing, dance and destroy chaos (basically the kind of thing you could see in a bad LSD trip, I mean what else could you see a T-Rex playing golf and jump on a Spider-man ball?). They end up in the circus and Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) makes children who have become friends with dinosaurs sign an empty contract. Why? Why should children sign an empty contract ??? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs get a little ... "Brain-Drain" they will let the kids go. The dinosaurs instead of tearing apart the evil limb of Screweyes from a limb, give up and accept its terms. What?! This is stupid! They could have threatened him, dropped his contract, eat it and then leave with the children. I think the filmmakers were trying to prove that violence is bad, which is a controversial point when in the end the dinosaurs escape and a group of crows wraps around Screweyes and apparently eat it completely. Oh yes, it's not at all violent! We came back meaningless, it's not funny, it's stupid, it's stupid, badly written and contains some of the biggest holes in the plot ever made in the cinema. Even for a children's movie ... this is BAD.
