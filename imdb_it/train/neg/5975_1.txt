I never wanted to see this movie, then one day, for a joke, I saw it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions have been confirmed. <br /> <br /> To begin with I would like to question the policy of the film. It hides behind the mask of women "making it big in the city", but the only way women can do it is by using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or ability. These women are nothing but whores. Can not the somewhat less attractive girls succeed? This is not the only right message in the film, there are hundreds of shots of American flags and huge wads of money. A fine example of how the only powerful thing in America is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in this film. Money is depicted as the only important thing for young people. <br /> <br /> The bar manager says that she does not allow addicts in her bar, and then goes on to poor liters of alcohol down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. Anyone who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs. <br /> <br /> And finally, why the scenes in which the protagonist is a sexual point of view the interest in the public (when he undresses or with his boyfriend) is that his father is always involved? We watch her undress with the camera that virtually caresses her legs while she is her father's phone. She "sells" her father just as she "sells" her boyfriend. I find this more strange. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this film is immoral, fascist, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing. But what else do you expect from Jerry Bruckhiemer?
