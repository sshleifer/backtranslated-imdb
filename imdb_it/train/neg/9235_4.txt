This woman never stops talking throughout the film. He memorized every line and delivered everything without a bit of natural emotion. He also has a more exhilarating lisp, and the tone of his voice sounds like nails on a blackboard. This film has WAY too Betsy Drake, and not enough Cary Grant, who brought the little that remained of the film entirely on his own.
