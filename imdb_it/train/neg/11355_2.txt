"Nat" (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), together with his friend "IQ" (voiced by Philip Bolden) and the always-hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They want to be the first flies in space. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft landed on the moon, the Apollo 11, is waiting for its historic journey on the launch pad near where the three meet. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the film. I found it very well done. The scenery had depth, as things in the distance really seemed to be behind the fire of the scenes. I didn't see the 3-D movie, as it was shown on HBO. However, I saw that there were no scenes that exploited the 3D effects, except for a clash of characters near the end. Also, I wasn't very impressed with the character design. For me, they didn't look like anything that looked like a fly, especially in coloring. The flies were an unusual blue-gray that gave me some distraction. <br /> <br /> The cast's performances weren't bad, but that wasn't good either. Many times I focused more on my computer than on history. The writing was certainly written for a younger audience, with comic moments that will make the little ones laugh. I have not seen anything for adults, like the jokes that will have the ending line for adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this film. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, since the main goal was flies. I also hated when a famous astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the flies in the movie were fictional, and that there were no flies on Apollo 11. I liked the way he thanked the men and the women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though. <br /> <br /> If you are an adult, this is not for you. It was not created for the whole family. This is certainly only for children. But, save this for a rainy day.
