Strange ... I like all the film crew movies and dark humor; but I didn't like this at all! It's terrible, horrible and certainly not fun at all. Too bad not being able to do a whole film plot, disgust either. And it was really boring Long empty moments fill the film; may have been removed. It should be in another shorter format, for sure. Perhaps I was expecting too much from the crew - how to save the film lol -. He is also full of clich√©s abused of characters and situations ... I don't understand why people liked ... "Poetry", "hope"; No, mom, I haven't seen anything like it! ^^ All in all, it is empty and raw, pitiful and hopeless. Oh damn this ........
