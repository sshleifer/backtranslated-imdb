The TV guide defines this film as a mystery. What is a mystery to me is how it is possible that a culture capable of producing such intricate and complex classical music and brilliant mathematicians cannot produce a single film that would rise above the despicable level of garbage that this film represents so perfectly . This is Bollywood at its best / worst, I really can't tell the difference. Nauseably sweet clich√©s, kitsch on every level, plot, situations, dialogue, music and choreography. To put it bluntly, you must be a retard to enjoy it. I saw it to satisfy my cultural curiosity, but there were moments when I had to leave, because I couldn't stand it anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses. <br /> <br />
