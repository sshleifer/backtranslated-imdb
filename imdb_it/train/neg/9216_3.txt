Hoo boy, this was a real test to overcome. The DVD case has the mug of Tom Hanks on it and that's the only reason why someone should buy it. It has about forty points on the box, however, the film was made in 1982, so it still has the role of Bosom Buddies and, of course, has about forty pounds less. The plot is about a game of Dungeons and Dragons that Hanks and his three friends play and Hanks ends up thinking that everything is real. Chris Makepeace is a genius boy named Jay Jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a series of funny hats. Ooh, look, he has a yellow helmet lit with a tuxedo! He is now dressed as a pilot of the First World War! This was a really terrible movie but in a bad way. A group of veterinarians appears mainly as parents of children. There's Anne (I'm Honey West, damn it!) Francis and Louise Sorel, who actually look pretty hot. Murray Hamilton, the mayor of Jaws, has an ungrateful role as a policeman. Wendy Crewson, it's the love interest for Hanks and a blond boy I've never seen before or after. There is some syrupy music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement. There is a monster that only Hanks can see why he is, you know, crazy. The monster is played by the deceased, great Kevin Peter Hall, he of Predator fame. A friend of mine extracted this old discount container from MallWart and advised me to throw it in the trash without even looking at it, so of course I had to see if it was as bad as this. Was. The night before, I looked at Apollo 13, so later, this movie was a bit of a shock. Do yourself a favor and leave it in the trash. Oh yes, after Hanks has almost climbed from one of the towers of the World Trade Center because of his disappointments, he returns home to recover and is visited by his friends. Hanks' mother, a real drunk Vera Miles, says she's coming very well now, but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in her tennis outfit, he's crazier than ever. The end
