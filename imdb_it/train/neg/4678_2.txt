This film has had some andrenaline kickers, but it's an old story that simply could never happen. The navy's protocols could never break down so much that a crew much less an XO could ever get that far against the Captain. I will take Dr. Strangelove every day if I wish to see this plot. Sidenote: The US Navy did not support this film.
