I read the whole book 'A wrinkle over time' and then I saw the film. The film contained all the elements of the book but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours, he felt really full of too many effects and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle over time concerns a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin must work together to find Meg's father and escape from the island of Camazotz. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film is really a stinker. The acting is horrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far the situations are not necessary. I was really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and created the film, made a great book and a terrible movie. Acting is worse than any live acting on video. Yes, I have to admit that there were interesting effects. But seriously they were all done in a terrible and non-serial way in any way possible. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the film. I would like to give it a 0 but unfortunately I can only give it 1. One half could have been useful.
