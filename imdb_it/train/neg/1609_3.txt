The first part, Che in Cuba, talks about that part of his life. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and it ministers to too many indistinguishable wounds (remember that Che was a doctor). It ends when Castro wins the revolution; That never arrives in Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, talks about guessing what. It contains too many indistinguishable battles and ministers too many indistinguishable wounds. <br /> <br /> When I realized that this was supposed to be an "epic" (I never knew * anything * but the title before it started), of course I thought about the greatest epic of them all, Lawrence of David Lean's Arabia. More than that later. <br /> <br /> Don't be a racist, but apart from what I've already mentioned is the fact that there are too many characters that are, well, indistinguishable - unknown Hispanic actors who look the same way, especially considering that everyone wears beards "Che" and wear all the labors of Che. This results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (Fidel also has a much smaller role). While Del Toro is terrifying, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only visible character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You have an idea. <br /> <br /> Because the other characters are interchangeable, this results in a reference loss. When Che's best helpers are killed, you feel no remorse since you don't know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think it's a spoiler), there's no empathy from the public - he's just dead. <br /> <br /> It's too one-dimensional to relate to a human being. Besides being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral rectitude, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married with five children (he tells another character that he is near the end). What was his motivation? A complete puzzle. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh is just mimicking Lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mysterious man from Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and partners (Guinness, Quinn). He was as brave as he was insecure - that is, he had human qualities. Che is like a car, as hot as The Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongol. What makes Mongol look like a wonderful life.
