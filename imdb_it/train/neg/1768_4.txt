This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - the immortal cats that kill for a living, etc. - A sort of variation on the concept of vampire. <br /> <br /> The thing that brings everything down is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that it is necessary to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look at how long it takes to capture the Unibomber, and that's because a family member understood it. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the child (and to a lesser extent, the mother) behaves as if it were untouchable. The boy kills without a thought to leave no evidence or a trail or a living witness. How these people have managed to remain alive and undiscovered for a month is incredible, not to mention decades or centuries. <br /> <br /> It's really a pity - this could have been a lot more if it had been plausibly written, that is, to give the main characters the level of common sense that they needed to get away with for so long. <br /> <br /> Besides this, it's not a bad show. I loved the piece at the end where every cat in the city converges in the house - every time I put the food on the porch and I see our cats suddenly rushing from wherever they were before, I think of that scene.
