Without any affinity with any kind of direction, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself for the trouble of sitting for the entire duration of "20 dates". I won't waste time with the plot, you could read more reviews. But I will say that the hyper, Woody Allen's narrative of Berkowitz was extremely annoying. Or you wanted him to be fired for coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it is potentially obvious to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as part of it details his evidence to finance the documentary. Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I'll give Berkowitz credit for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrible piece of ****. I appreciate the limits and intentions of the film here, but also when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets, launches and misses at all levels. In conclusion, I am sure that many of these companions were not at ease in an appointment with a voracious and unpredictable director, and therefore I question the sense of authenticity of the film. Hey Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or it was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
