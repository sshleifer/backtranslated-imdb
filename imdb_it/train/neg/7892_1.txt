It started with an interesting premise. I always like the things of the Civil War and the ancient secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at the most. In the second half, it quickly became a C movie, then D, then F, so "I wish it weren't a rental so I could put it in the microwave!" I can't say that the acting in all cases was horrible, just the majority. Writing, anyway ... I never read the book. Perhaps the book is well written. The script was written by a 10-year-old child. It was ridiculously superficial, the dialogue was sad and uninteresting, the characters were as interesting as a bag of 5-pound fertilizer. I really hated this movie, like my wife did. I am a Christian and I have no problems with films that promote or support Christianity. This film has done a great disservice to the cause. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you liked it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
