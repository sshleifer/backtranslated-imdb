Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrait of GIDEON. This film could have been a classic if Lambert sounded as good as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump, or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN, or Sean Penn in the role of Sam Dawson in I AM SAM. <br /> <br /> Too bad because the plot is meaningful to us in life, Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters performances were excellent. 3 of 10.
