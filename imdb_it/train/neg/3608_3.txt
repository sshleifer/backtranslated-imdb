I have a nice collection of films in progress, and this has been added to it. Number 274 to be exact. <br /> <br /> The title made me go early. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great horror movie. I never made a mistake Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but this was one that was more a laugh than a scare. <br /> <br /> Poor audio quality, poor acting and poor arrangements are some of the areas that could be improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is ideal for a good laugh. If you're looking for one of those movies to make fun of, then this is one!
