OK, I admit I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (of which I'm a big fan), but I'm not one of those people who automatically give a MST3K movie a 1/10 rating. Even though I hate many of the movies I play, and some are among the worst movies I've ever seen, I was able to enjoy some MST3K movies. That being said, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. (No wonder, in fact, that the same MST3K authors have commented that this was one of the worst. Don't believe me, take a look at their site.) <br /> <br /> For me, this film is a good example of what NOT to do in the cinema. The dialogue is bad, the acting is worse, the cinematography is pathetic in the direction (while perhaps it is the best thing about this film) it is ugly. <br /> <br /> Rhythm is the worst part of this movie. Sometimes in this film, the viewer has literally had to wait minutes for something to happen. While minutes may not seem like a very long amount of time, it can be in a movie, particularly in this one. I'm sure it was meant to create a mood, but I was just very bored. It really took ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If "suspension of disbelief" means "almost falling asleep during a movie", then it has a lot of that. But THE SCREAMING SKULL is simply so horrible, there is no way I could ever have been interested in whatever is happening in the film, and therefore the "suspension of disbelief" was really non-existent. <br /> <br /> One of the worst, and probably the most boring movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1/10
