This ugly video was initially banned in Britain and granted last November without cuts. <br /> <br /> Presents the Playboy Playmate of October 1979, Ursula Buchfellner. The opening goes back and forth between Buchfellner and the images of the misty jungle. I'm not sure what the purpose was. It would have been much better to concentrate on the bathtub scene. <br /> <br /> Laura (Buchfellner) is kidnapped and kept in the jungle for ransom. Peter (Al Cliver - The Beyond, Zombie) is sent to find her and the ransom. Naturally, one of the kidnappers (Antonio de Cabo) manages to pass the time productively, while another (Werner Pochath) cries incessantly. <br /> <br /> The ransom exchange goes to hell, and Laura runs into the jungle. Will Peter save her before the cannibals have lunch? Oh yes, there are cannibals in this jungle. Why do you think it was a bad video! Muriel Montossé is found by Peter and his companion (Antonio Mayans - Angel of death) on the kidnapper's boat. Montossé is very undressed. Peter leaves them and leaves alone to find Laura, who has been captured by now. They spend time having sex and don't see the danger approaching. Courage, anyone? Great fight between Peter and the naked devil (Burt Altman). Blood, beheading, guts, a lot of the whole front, some big contortions of the cannibal priestess (Aline Mess), and the line, "They tore his heart", which is hilarious if you see the movie.
