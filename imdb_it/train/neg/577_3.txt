First of all, Jon Bon Jovi doesn't seem to be on the spot in a vampire movie. Together with the other characters not so interesting and with a poor plot, the whole film becomes predictable. If you keep this in mind and are a fan of vampire movies, you can have fun with some scenes. Don't expect any Tarantino-style chapter and no Anne Rice plot here. (I expect to have forgotten the whole film by tomorrow;)
