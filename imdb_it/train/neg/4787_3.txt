This item is certainly interesting for fans of the series (like me), but it's mostly incomprehensible. The plot is confusing, as is the continuity of the continuation. Some surprising effects, of course, but we never find out what everything really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the version of the "NC-17" workprint that contains the gore that was cut to be re-evaluated "R".
