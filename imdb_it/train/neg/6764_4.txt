NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994) <br /> <br /> Cinema Cut: R <br /> <br /> Director's Cut: NC-17 <br /> <br /> It is an unusual image of Oliver Stone, but when I read that he was drugged during filming, I didn't need further explanation. 'Natural Born Killers' is a risky, crazy and unconventional film that is not obtained very often; strange psychotic and artistic images. <br /> <br /> "Natural Born Killers" is basically the story of how two massacres were divulged and glorified by the media; there is a great scene in which an interviewer interrogates some teenagers about Mickey and Mallory, and the teenager says "Murder is wrong ... but if I were a mass murderer I would be Mickey and Mallory". Mickey describes it with a situation of "Frankenstein (the monster) and Dr. Frankenstein" - Dr. Frankenstein is the media that transformed them into these monstrous assassins <br /> <br /> Most of Oliver Stone's films examines the defects of America, the country that the director loves and admires. I imagine that "Natural Born Killers" is about the effect of mass media, technology and how obsessive a nation is, Americans are (and most of the world) about things like mass murderers and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The murderers played by Woody Harrelson (Mickey) and Juliette Lewis (Mallory) are performed in amazing fashion by two excellent actors who intervene in the lives of two brutally interesting assassins. Mickey and Mallory believe that some people are worthy of killing, perhaps in the cruel theory of social Darwinism (the survival of the fittest) - says Mickey in his prison interview, that other species commit murder, we as human beings loot other species and we exploit the environment; the script is interesting, but it is questionable how much this film admits, in the sense of making us reflect on society and human behavior, rather than on the intensity of a 2-hour bloodbath that we have seen. <br /> <br /> The last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison; we see the harsh realities of prison life; the attitude of the director etc., the overfilling of prisons: perhaps Stone is questioning the future, the path that society is leading. <br /> <br /> Two other interesting characters; First, a reporter who runs a show on 'America's Maniacs' and is obsessed with increasing ratings, which goes everywhere to capture the story of Mickey Mouse and Mallory. The other is police officer Scagnetti, a madman, perhaps a sadistic officer who is in love with Mallory - he also has a strange obsession with mass murderers, since his mother was killed during the massacre in Waco, in Texas, by Charles Whitman. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is superb; different colors, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the most evident green color of all is green, to resemble the disease of murderers (in pharmacies when they look for the antidote to rattlesnake). <br /> <br /> Work with the camera is insane; shaky, sparkling, it takes some determination to use it and accept it. Very unorthodox, psychedelic and unusual. <br /> <br /> 'Natural Born Killers' does not captivate the existence of crazy murderers, challenges it and as we, as a public, can feed this attribute ... <br /> <br /> Although the review above seems pretty positive, I don't like the movie. Quentin Tarantino, who originally wrote the screenplay for the film, was not satisfied with the modified script and asked to remove his name. I can understand why. While sometimes slightly interesting, Natural Born Killers is a mess of a photo. <br /> <br /> 4/10
