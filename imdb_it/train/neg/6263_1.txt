"Salamare Weekend" by Henry Sala is a piece of rotten Troma mud. This is a youthful, sloppy and stupid horror film about some teenage girls who spend the weekend in a villa. The professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform horrible experiments. Using a brain implant transforms his victims and their dates into zombies. "Nightmare Weekend" is a completely extravagant piece of rubbish that presents a lot of nudity and a bit of gingival blood, not to mention a laughable musical score. it's horrendous and the script is completely inconsistent. Because this piece of shit is widely distributed is beyond me. Avoid like the plague.1 out of 10.
