I want so much to give this piece of GARBAGE to zero, unfortunately, there is not, therefore, I had to give it a 1 just to warn you how stupidly terrible this impostor of a family cartoon is! The characters seem designed by preschoolers, no, wait, I saw preschoolers doing better! I prefer "The Misadventures of Flapjack" to this terrible excuse for a cartoon! I'm probably saying what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember that episode of Dexter's Lab when they ran go-karts on that volcano? yes, Mr. Fellows even cashed that idea and failed! They even snatched Shadow Lugia in that one episode that parodied Pokemon! (He even cashed that franchise!) That character is a cheap scam of Mandark from Dexter's Lab! Mister Fellows needs to be sued for a legal violation for this piece of shit !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like the Johnny test (RIP-OFF), are lying to yourself. Do yourself a favor, switch channels when this rip-off tries to dishonor your screen!
