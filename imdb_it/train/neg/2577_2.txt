This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a VHS view I had not seen before. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very beautiful story - about people seriously injured in a hospital and their various personalities - it quickly turned into a very profane soap opera with unlikely characters. /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) the stereotype of a white racist person, who spells the key word every other sentence and is so despicable that they didn't name him in the film. It's a lot of fun to be around. Then, there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a womanizer who talks fast. Snipes must have liked those arrogant "hip" roles that speak quickly, because he has played in many of them, as in "White Men Can not Jump." Then there is the sweet Helen Hunt who plays "Anna" that wonderful caring and loving person who is having an adulterous relationship with the protagonist of the movie "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> Yup, this is kind of moving, wellness stuff. It just makes my heart melt by looking at these nice people. But, if you are one of those who love squalid characters portrayed by squalid people in this unpleasant film ..... you might really like it! Add a dose of Hollywood political correctness and here you are! What more could you want?
