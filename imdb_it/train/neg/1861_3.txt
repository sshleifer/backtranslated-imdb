You know what kind of movie you get when the main character of the serial killer is transported in the electric chair (in what looks like a bakery truck), just to make the prison vehicle clash (and I'm not doing this on) a tank truck genetic engineering. The slime that springs from it melts and melts his DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film, however, is a shot over the shoulder of the snowman who beats a poor schmuck, in which his hands look suspiciously like a pair of white oven gloves . They could be ... Mmmmm, schlock ...
