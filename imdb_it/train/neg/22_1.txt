I saw this DVD in my friend's house and I thought it was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood names, not very big. Interested enough, I decide to give it a shot later ... It was a difficult experience to put up with believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits, I thought "We Turks really sucks at Hollywood style movies ... This is an insult to the genre of robbery hostage ..." but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, this was not a Turkish film; on the contrary, it was literally filmed in America with an American director and crew! This made me think-again! - How come you will be able to persuade names like Michael Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably .. This made me think further .. How can you increase that amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? Then I repaid all my meditation and came to find the answer. Assuming the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. And if you still have difficulty adjusting your budget then: writing and directing the film you are trying to produce - or vice versa I have no information on this -. In conclusion, this is not a bad movie since everyone is so eager to introduce themselves as ... It makes you think - in my case even meditating - and there are many films that don't even give that influence .. This at least makes you to think; It makes you wonder .. It leaves you incredulous .. and then it makes you wonder again ..
