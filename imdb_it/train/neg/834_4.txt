I discovered that this is a total waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" films, but the rehash of the original film's plot with a "new perspective" is a historical minimum ... soon they will come by simply releasing the original films with new animations and new songs and calling it a "new version of the movie we all love". Nathan Lane surprisingly returns to his role as Timon once again. Timon and Pumbaa the animated animals of the world of the original "Lion King" embark on a narrative journey to tell the original story in the way that REALLY happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. Vocal talents are impressive for a video function, but then again, when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane being in something real commercial substance? Overall if you liked the original you will hate this. It is offensive because it is unfair to both children and adults. And this sums up.
