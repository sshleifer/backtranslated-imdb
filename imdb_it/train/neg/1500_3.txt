Oh, it's so ugly, it's fun. The only way one can explain such a thing is a porn party with drugs that led to the resolution of making a movie just for fun. I mean, you can see topless porn actresses having sex, then being killed by human mutants. There's a lot of blood, including the classic "there's something wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she was" and the accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find fun things like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods and then he finds himself decapitated by a thread tied between two trees (which makes a metallic sound later, like in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what is inside an actress, simple genitals are not enough. So we see many summary autopsies on the bimbos killed. There is no dialog box. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when he accepted a role here. I think this is a movie to watch with the button fast forward and only look at juicy things, just to remember the old horror films of class C.
