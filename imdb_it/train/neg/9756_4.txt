Despite the title (English), this seems to have little to do with the Devils and much more to do with a power-hungry ruler who seeks the Philosos Stone and wants gold made of lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have few problems in making people condemn people to death when they think they threaten their position or when they need virgins for their blood. He is fundamentally encouraged by his beloved and by an alchemist he has hired, and it is more greed and madness that seems to be his problem rather than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least a bit exciting like rides and grown-up men trying to beat each other down with big keys, and the film looks good at least, but otherwise there is little to recommend. Little introverted and nothing to be afraid of, and in an unusual way, for a film by Molina / Naschy, not really an involuntary humor. Therefore, 4 out of 10.
