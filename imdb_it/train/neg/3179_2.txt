I saw this movie by chance yesterday in a cinema. I had some hopes for the film because I really like Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and the book on which it is based. The film starts well, it seems that at the beginning it's a nice thriller. Quickly, however, the film becomes a mess with uninteresting plots, characters that have never been made and that nobody in the audience has taken care of (like Marjoke) and a terrible montage. The film has faded to black pieces that are simply too long, a messy chronology that jumps back and forth and many scenes that add nothing to the plot and could easily have been eliminated. After suffering from history, you will be treated to one of the worst endings I've seen in a long time. It must also be said that the film has many explicit sex scenes you are probably used to if you watch a lot of Dutch movies. It is difficult to talk about positive things about this film. About a third of the audience had already left the theater in the middle of the film and I didn't hear a kind word after the film was finished. Avoid this movie at all costs. it really destroyed every faith I had left in the Dutch film industry.
