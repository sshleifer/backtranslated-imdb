This is the first film from Guinea Pig from Japan and this is the most serious, in my opinion. A group of boys torture a girl for several days before killing her. And at this point, I will say that these films are NOT real! They are fake horror films that try to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting but also unrealistic in many cases. For example, when they kick the girl on the floor, we can clearly see how they kick and block the floor next to the girl! And how stupid it is! Sound effects are also unrealistic and make no sense. Other scenes include intestines of animals thrown on the girl, the girl exposed to loud noises for many hours, the tearing of the nails, the worms placed on the wounds in the girl's body, the pierced and mutilated eye in horrible details and things like that. Very sick and petty film and has absolutely nothing precious or cinematically meaningful. This first entry is the sickest and most amateur guinea pig, even if it's not as bloody as the next part, Flowers of Flesh and Blood, which tries to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil's The experiment is perhaps the sickest thing I've seen and the closest thing to smell is. This is still (obviously) false s (n / t) uff, the only difference with the real "sniffing movie" is that nobody really dies or hurts in this movie. I cannot recommend it to anyone as it is so simple and repulsive. Those who consider this a great horror film do not understand anything about cinema and its true meaning. I saw it as a curiosity (like the other parts of the series) and now I know how insignificant the waste is. They only work at shock level and this is not too valuable a cinematic result. Devil's Experiment is perhaps the sickest film I've ever seen and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting film I've ever seen. So these are pretty extreme in my book, but that's all they are.
