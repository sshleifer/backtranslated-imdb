This film contained mediocrity, laziness and thoughtlessness. If you're going to make a vampire movie that has already been done thousands of times, then it's better to do a good job. I will be the first to say that this film has not been cut. Some horror / scary movies fail to break the patterns of "let them do something forbidden and abandoned for fun because all the stories are just lies" clich√©s. This, unfortunately, was no different, and like all films of fear, once you venture on that road you can't go back. <br /> <br /> And the ending? How do heroes do the same job over and over again throughout the film, but then mysteriously get involved in the moment and fail to do the job at the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 that I will never look at. Terrible movie
