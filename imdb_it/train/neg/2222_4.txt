Carlo Verdone once managed to combine a superb comedy with intelligent and subtle social analysis and criticism. Then something happened and it turned into another boring director "holier than you". <br /> <br /> My Best Enemy can be more or less summarized in a row "working class = kind and warm, while upper-class = snob and devious." But love wins in the end ". <br /> <br /> Such a trivial clich√© for such a clever director. <br /> <br /> There isn't really much to talk about in the film. Each character is a traveling stereotype: the self-made-man who forgets his roots but who will become "good" again, the despised wife, the rich rebellious girl who falls in love with the honest but poor boy ... Acting is barely average. <br /> <br /> Seriously disappointing in every respect.
