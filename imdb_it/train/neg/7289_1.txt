This is a film of immense fascination for a relatively well defined group (of which I am not a part). I went to a preview of this film without knowing what to expect - in the end I found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional (often decidedly "twisted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic saga like this should really give its viewers something more at the end. Ultimately, images like this concern the human condition - this image projects almost no new light on any of its most significant facets.
