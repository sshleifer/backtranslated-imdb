Redundant, eternal shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you will find in this film. In other words, it seemed technically poor to me. The musical parts are directed in an amateur way (no synchrony in the sudden dance, bad post-synchronization, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. In the end, it has few points and even less sense. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are actually efficient, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand in the end. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, not true for the film. That is to say that the discrepancy between the trailer and the real film is something very close to a rip-off.
