Yes, Madsen's character - while talking to the woman at the TV station - is right: the LAPD is a corrupt, violent and racist police. And this film doesn't change anything about it. Ok, here are the good cops, the moral cops, even the black ones, who are a Christian, a martyr. But this is a fairy tale, admit it. The reality is not so. And the most important thing for action fans: the shooting is boring. It's just shooting, shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, so you'll have at least something to do. The only moral of this film is: the LAPD is good now. No more bad cops. If you like non-critical, euphemistic spots for the police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 points for camera and editing).
