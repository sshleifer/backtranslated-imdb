This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So he goes to discover that his neighbor is a photographer. This film could have had a fantastic plot, but then the plot dries up with all hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin. If they brought out scenes in which someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. Whenever I thought a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really boring to have so much drug use in a movie. It has attracted attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. Lesbian things didn't bother me. I was looking for a film about art. I found a film about drug use.
