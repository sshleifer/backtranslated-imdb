The last of Johnny Weissmuller's films Tarzan is a good thing, as this is undoubtedly the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years. There are no sirens here or like a beautiful woman on the island who tries to escape the clutches of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be his bride. Find Tarzan and Jane, who are trying to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially evil High Priest, but he is not used to all his advantages. Also at hand and worthy of mention is an extremely annoying guitarist / singer who goes to sing every now and then. Even the "great" Robert Florey cannot help this. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (of four)
