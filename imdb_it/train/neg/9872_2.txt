It is hard to believe that the film in this book can manage to overcome its terrible nature! The plot is so invented and incredible. . . starting to do a lot of guilt on a small child to save his pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and perhaps more people (including the clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Then we have a wife who, apparently, in the length of a ferry ride, passes from being relatively happy to throw away the tracks. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, helped, supported and supported by a group of politically correct friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina did not help the story, although it may have helped the filmmakers' budget. The very beautiful buildings that presumably housed the monastery did not seem logically suitable for an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger, who I really like, is painfully thin in this film and his hairstyle certainly belongs to another decade. Furthermore, there is simply no chemistry between her and one of the two protagonists. I didn't really like the book from which it was taken, but I read everything. The film that I kept browsing back and forth had to leave whenever the mushy music got too much. Unless you like an incredible story, a wooden acting, a twisted mixture of religion / mythology / allegory, my advice is to skip this. Oh, and maybe a little criticism of the carp, but a caring dad wouldn't have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat? The best part of this film is the scenario
