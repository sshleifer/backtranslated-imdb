An outrageously scruffy karate / horror thriller with a lot of graphic violence and free nudity and a completely absurd and bizarre "plot". This is a lowbrow, low-level entertainment that will appeal only to viewers with particularly extravagant tastes, but it's a bit cheerfully naughty and I have to admit I wasn't really bored while watching it ....
