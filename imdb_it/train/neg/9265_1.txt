After listening to and appreciating the commentary by Omen II of Harvey Bernhard, I was shocked to discover that he too was behind this absolute piece of trash. It's like a really bad TV movie that you might catch a glimpse of in the middle of the day when you have the flu and you're too sick to reach the remote. I think the point where Michael Lerner is faced with what I can only describe as a Les Miserables high school cast, my mouth open in disbelief. And then my mouth was going up and down because I was laughing so much. To say. I don't know why I have to write a minimum of ten lines, I summarized my point of view synthetically, there is nothing intelligent in all this modern verbosity.
