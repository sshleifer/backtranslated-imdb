This 2003, made for TV movies, was shown on a female channel, of course. As a man, why do I even try to watch this? I don't know, but I should have my head examined. And the director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice like he does. It takes away any strength and conviction that a man can have by having several boring women who let him in. The first is that Joyce Hyser is the wife. I couldn't wait for him to leave her. His revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing for most of the film. The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz, the coldest person you ever wanted to meet. His appearance didn't allow our main man to make that monkey over her and his acting was so obvious, he could miss only a fool. Definitely a loser. Tembi Locke was pretty good, but slow in absorbing the slut that seduced her husband, still played as a loser boy, by David DeLuise. To complete the cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but gets excited about our hero. Stephen Jenkins as our hero, or should I say victim, was not so good. At first I thought he was just a bad actor, but later I believed him. He never got the ground part and was repetitive all the time. Even though, as a man, I was furious when the two women got away with it. Men, watch out for this channel that puts men on the ground and women go away even with murder. LMN is the channel. Caution. Note: after looking at it for the second time by mistake, I am convinced of my first thoughts. Especially for the writer / director, Simon Gornick. I still believe he disgraced the male species and should be whipped on horseback. Only thanks for this film is Tembi Locke who has no chance to show his talents with the horrible acting of Jenkins, Hyser, Hiltz and DeLuise. Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse. Down with the Gornick movie and its empty stars. Please LMN no longer show this trite.
