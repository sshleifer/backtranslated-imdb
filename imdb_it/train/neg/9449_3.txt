Seuss was alive, Dr. Seuss would surely be angry. Cat in the Hat proves to show how film productions can take a classic story and turn it into a pile of mindless madness. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like an unlucky show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The children in this film are fine, somewhere between the lines of boring and boring. The story is just like the original with a couple of changes and like most movies based on other stories, never change with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He's a stupid villain who would never get anywhere in life. This film is like a comic book rejected by the newspaper if you think about it. The film really looks gaudy! Sure, there are fun jokes for adults like when the cat cuts its tail and the censorship goes out before he utters a bad, slightly funny word. At least the Grinch had done the sperm, and the movie was really good! This film is a cartoon snot with bright colors and mediocre bad action. Was Mike Myers even in this movie? And another thing, fish. What's with that stupid fish! The first time you see it, it's a real fish. The next time you see it, it's all animated and talks. But it looks like a animated piece of rubber playing dough! This film is a total wreck. Good joke, bad joke, ugly, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised he also had good jokes like the joke about the water park, it was good. So please if you have the choice, look at the Grinch instead of this mess.
