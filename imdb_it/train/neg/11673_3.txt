1st watched 17/05/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): the fairly obvious story of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much-announced event. The replay of the disaster is not bad, but the drama that surrounds it is sometimes silly, misinterpreted and too theatrical. The story is very similar to that of the most recent Oscar winner, except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the real disaster that was occurring until almost too late. Good only for nostalgia purposes and to get an idea of ​​what James Cameron was competing (barely ??) in his recreation.
