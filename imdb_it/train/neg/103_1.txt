Without wishing to be a troublemaker, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and cliché movies I've ever seen - this is one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the press is poor and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you could do better yourself". Maybe this is a challenge for everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie crap? <br /> <br /> I bought it for £ 1, but remember, you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You would do well to avoid this turkey, even at a bargain basement price.
