Black Candles is rather a confused mess by the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others .. I'm just looking at the ones I've seen. In any case, we have a couple that makes love and then somewhere near a pin is suspended on a voodoo doll and then punctures it, and the man gives in. I'm not sure if it was good for both of us at that point. We advance quickly towards the point where the man's sister came home to investigate and listen to the will reading, or something like that, and of course all the others, except her, are involved in something, which is devil worship . It's really hard to say who is who in some moments of the movie and sometimes gets a little confused. To make things more interesting, there is a scene of simulated bestiality (I hope it's simulated) with a black goat, certainly a pleasure for the crowd. Ugh. Sometimes this recalls "Rosemary's Baby", minus the child, because the landlady always gives women an herbal tea and the place also smells like those ugly satanic herbs, because this continues to be noticed. However, herbs are not the only thing that stinks about this film. The end seems to be back at the beginning, and many viewers might find themselves wondering where they were during the middle part. It's not unwatchable, it's not very nice, and I guess it all depends on what you like to see in the movies, and here there wasn't much that did much for me. 3 out of 10.
