I'm a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the protagonist of a recent film, not just a little bit, made me happy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I did a film appreciation in college and the only thing I can say I didn't like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of the city and there was no background traffic or lookie loos. <br /> <br /> I must say that acting leaves something to be desired, but Arnold is an excellent actor, I have to give him a bad direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. <br /> <br /> I love Arnold Vosloo and made the film visible. Otherwise, I would have written it as another bad movie. <br /> <br /> I found the brutal and useless rape scene, but the actors who got away eventually were pretty good. But the sound effects of the shoot-outs were quite negative. There are some flaws in the film (continuity), but they are negligible considering the low level of the film. <br /> <br /> All in all I liked the movie, because there was Arnold Vosloo. <br /> <br /> Jackie
