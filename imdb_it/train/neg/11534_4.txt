* NOTICE * Contains MANY SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I would like to start by saying that I have enormous respect for Gillian Anderson's incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress, which is why I can't understand her reasons for agreeing to do it once she has seen the script (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> The premise of the film was, in my opinion, a great idea and there were some really exciting themes, but it ended up like a collapsed souffl√©. It exemplifies why I hate 99% of British cinema. It seems too long, it's boring, for the most part, and it doesn't happen long after the first twenty minutes. Just when you think there is a chance to accelerate, it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon. With a small, imaginative director and a minimalist storyline, there's not much to do to keep the audience from hanging out in their popcorn. As for the script, I can only assume that the writer was trying to save some trees, with the media scene reading something along the lines of "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Adam stares Adam running in the woods) (Alice follows) Alice: ADAM! ADAM! "I suspect that, word by word, the actors were probably paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile ads. Those few lines didn't have many variations with frequent use of the word f that would make the friend of Bridget Jones, Shazza: There are a few main character establishments before the main sordid event that leaves the audience devoid of much sympathy for the characters as well as an automatic reaction "Oh, it's terrible". <br /> <br /> Alice is not the kind of woman who likes the courts She has a great job, an expensive London apartment with a roof to die for, yet she appears on the screen as presumptuous, embittered and dissatisfied, before her life turns into the worst After the attack some layers are removed that explain how this is the way to start, grew up with an old soldier of the boots who thought that teaching her to shoot with the gun was the maximum and expression of love, so instead of following in his footsteps, he ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel as if her life was worth living. Instead he found a group of stereotypical middle-class Toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security / entertainment system (ie becoming Mrs. Robinson in Wanna-be a Cockney amateur electrician) Someone hands me a handkerchief. The only thing that saves this character is that it is played by Gillian Anderson. In the hands of a minor actress it would have been intolerably one-dimensional, but Ms. Anderson actually succeeds in injecting some fleeting moments of humanity into this lifeless human being, especially when she sincerely apologizes for her street fury in a vain attempt to prevent his attackers from continuing their assault. <br /> <br /> I can't say that even Adam went much better. Danny Dyer played it well as a fish out of water, Jack the Lad, but a good performance could not save him from the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background. <br /> <br /> The film was based primarily on the value of shock, but times were off and seemed too elaborate from beginning to end. As for the shock, the most shocking thing about this film is the shameless demonstration of how Mrs Anderson has become painfully thin; it was disturbing to see the brutal attack scenes. In a side note, only in a British film does a band of violent sexual assailants take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer up their comrades - to talk about an upper lip stretched to the extreme! If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery is donating money to make, then I'm not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pounds every week. <br /> <br /> To say I hated this movie gave him too much credit, I didn't care enough about any of the characters to guarantee that strong emotion. I want you to go back a couple of hours of my life, please!
