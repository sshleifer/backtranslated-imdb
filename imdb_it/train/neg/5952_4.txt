You realize that you've been looking at the EXACT SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers coexist on an island, but you would think that after seeing the scruffy, stinking heroes, crossing the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would have been enough to get you commit to something of a a little more original (and interesting). <br /> <br /> And I'm not even talking about the validity of the shows that I find questionable for the record. It is difficult to suspend disbelief for "Bushy Bill" while eating a mouse when the entire crew of producers and television operators is housed in a bio-air conditioning dome that sips icy mochcinno with moxy. <br /> <br /> the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their sinuous lives. I just don't understand. But if you find yourself fascinated by furry and unwashed people, I suggest you turn off the TV and take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their real habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and, for free, you can sit and marvel at their extraordinary ability to recover various cigarette fragments from a plethora of garbage cans, eventually hitting the "pay-dirt" and modeling a Dr. Frankenstein-style cancer -stick , all the while begging people for food changes when the smell of "Aqua Velva" in their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part? Just like Survivor, every week a member of the tribe "Leave" the "Island" when they are sent without ceremony to pack up at the local Institution when the frightening state of full schizophrenia rises! Now THAT IS ENTERTAINMENT!
