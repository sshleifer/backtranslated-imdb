Cribbio, only in the 70s ... Antonio Margheriti brings us this bizarre hybrid of spaghetti westerns and kung fu that evolves around a treasure hunt. The spices of this coproduction between Shaw Brothers and a unique Italian company include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall events and some very domesticated T & A. Extra campy moments are served by the opposing Lee Van Cleef wig, by the leather-covered psychopathic leather rapist Yancey Hobbitt (lovingly hammered by Julian Ugarte, the man who was supposed to make darker European genre productions than he did ), I want - a witty dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects that accompany various small events (in particular every jump made by Lo Lieh). <br /> <br /> While this small piece of action falls at the expense of the territory of Turkey, it is nice to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and the charisma of this duo cannot be denied. Don't expect too much, and you'll get a lot of it. <br /> <br /> This is my truth. What's your?
