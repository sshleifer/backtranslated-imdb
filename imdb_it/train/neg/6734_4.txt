I found this film a great idea, which it did not produce. They seem to have found a way to create suspense, but they haven't been able to stage their profits very well. In one case the police are on the clock to find the kidnappers' hideout. They laboriously go to the dentist to the dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the accumulation, the police arrive at the same time as it is released, which is very anti-climatic to say the least. There are also great narrative scenes that bring us "inside the thought" of the terrified husband and wife, which takes away the suspense rather than increase it. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice over is an insult and robs the viewer of any possibility of a personal experience with fear, as Hitchcock has shown over and over, is much more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the entire film, and get the fast, rather bland ending. I mean just ... "ends up" in snoring.
