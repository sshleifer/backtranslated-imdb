A soldier is on the side of the road, making sure that every 1 obeys the speed limit (doing his job); then he pulls up a woman who looks like a mother (there is a child in the back seat); then he is telling her what is wrong and BAM ... they are killed. Ok, this is the beginning of what I personally thought would be a good movie. When I was watching this movie at the theater I was with some friends. This was our first release after the summer, so we wanted to go see a good movie. We decided to see a suspense / thriller that seemed good to everyone in the group ... this was one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Not only did I waste $ 7.oo on a movie ticket, but I had to suffer brain torture. This film started with mystery and suspense and I seriously thought "this can't be bad" ... I was wrong. The whole problem with this film is that it doesn't make sense; even if you manage to overcome the bad acting, the "not so scary" plot and the horrible mess of this movie, you'll still be puzzled. It's not because you're not smart enough to understand it, it's because no human with a brain can understand what this stupid movie is about. Right now you might think "Oh man, I have to watch this movie just to see if it's as bad as this person says." RECEIVE YOUR HEAD NOW !!! I'm trying to spare you the trouble of watching this movie by telling you that it's so bad that it makes no sense even to consider seeing it. Please, people don't make the same mistake, I thought this movie has potential ... it doesn't. I give this movie 1 in 10 (if I could give it zero I would do it), and I don't recommend anyone to see this movie, you will save yourself many sleepless nights trying to think of w.t.f. what is the movie that drives you crazy.
