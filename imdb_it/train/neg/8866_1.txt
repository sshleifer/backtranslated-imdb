In theory, "Director's Comments" should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who recounts his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he worked on he worked on "Bonanza", "Flambards", "The Duchess of Duke Street" and "The Bounder". His comments are not the least informative, due to his habit of wandering off the point. <br /> <br /> But in practice, it has failed sadly. It's a joke show and the joke isn't particularly funny. The scripts are completely lacking in wit, and Bryden cannot convince as an old man. Every time something fun to say freezes, which is like every five seconds, it emits a hissing laugh. Rather than being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If old senile people strike you as hilarious, then this is for you. <br /> <br /> It didn't help that the mocked shows were, with the exception of "Mr & Mrs" and "Crossroads", quite good. For the joke to work, they needed to be really terrible like "Charlie's Angels", "OTT", "Telly Addicts", "Neighbors" and "New Faces". <br /> <br /> time, so fortunately we are spared from the horror of future editions. Wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if "the director's comment" was one day the subject of a parody?
