This film is a bad memory of my childhood. This is one of those movies that show children on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for a break, and would rather watch anything, NOTHING. At least it's like when I was in elementary school. I just remember hating this movie. Sure, I haven't seen him in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use him anymore on rainy days, but I just want to warn everyone: you'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than to entertain them. Trust me, choose something else. Although the subject is somewhat controversial, the plot is so docile and slow that I can't remember anything except that I didn't like it so much that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn you all against it.
