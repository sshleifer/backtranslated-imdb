slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the film of the book. This is certainly a case where the film should never be made at the expense of the book. The best part of the film was the scenery, excellent. The worst part was the slow interactions of the actors that combined with infinite and meaningful looks. The assembly is abrupt and irregular. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard, at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script. It was surprising that, although set in Peru, hardly a person of Peruvian descent wanders around the set - even in the flashback scenes that represent Peru in the 17th century. If you have a sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
