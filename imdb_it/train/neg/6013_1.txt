I've read every book so far in the left series, and the film doesn't do any of them justice. Sure, I've seen worse movies, but this was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have made a good MST3K episode. The script was a horrible adaptation of the book, and it seemed that the actors were reading their lines instead of telling them. The characters were rigid and unlikely. The effects were of cheese and looked terribly fake. The ending was terrible. First of all, he didn't even go through the first book. Second, it didn't make sense. If you hadn't read the book, you would have no idea what was going on. It must have been the most approximate film-style ending I've ever seen in a movie. I am angry that I actually paid money for this movie. If by some miracle, he gets a wide release, they should completely see him again and let Hollywood take over. Those two aspiring film producers and the aspiring director should leave the film to the professionals.
