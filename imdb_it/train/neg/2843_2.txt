Oh yes, Sakura Killers is a goofy, horrible ninja movie, don't go wrong. But it's also incredibly pleasant. This is largely thanks to the extraordinary presence of a Chuck Connors, who has been included as a protagonist in the film, but actually only shines in some scenes. I suppose it should be a type of Obi Wan Kenobi ("The tough ninja-buster", the copy of the box exclaims) but his "wisdom" is ridiculous. "Move without thinking" ??? My friend says this is a sign of mental retardation, not supreme concentration. <br /> <br /> But his two helpers, Sonny and Dennis, have such a horrible dialogue that "Brooklyn", as we call the Colonel, tends to shine in comparison. Above all, watch Dennis's logic regarding the "genetic splicing" with which the Sakura are involved. If you know something about cloning you will die laughing. And yes, this is an important point of the plot, folks. <br /> <br /> A terribly funny film, Sakura Killers is a difficult gem to find. I don't want to spoil the "trick" ending for you, except it's a perfect set for a Sakura Killers 2. Too bad Chuck Connors is dead. Sad Because he has the simplest ways to wipe out the ninjas.
