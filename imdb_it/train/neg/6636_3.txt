Some of the worst, least natural recitations I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the clumsy lame dialogue given to the characters of a note. Add to that the low-cost production values ​​and you have a film that doesn't even seem to belong to television. Not much is expected of a Lifetime movie, especially one so old, but this is almost deceptively bad. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise, is a terrible love story and cliché of a type that even Harlequin would take into consideration under them. You can guess how the rest of the movie will go by simply looking at the initial pairs of scenes. Surprise, the only female character who concentrates and the mysterious stranger ends up falling in love.
