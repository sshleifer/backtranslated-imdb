The poster that called this "Plotless andlessless" literally took the words I would use in my theme line. The only thing I would add is "without passion". For a film made by a real married couple and with many graphic sex scenes, this film manages to make what should be a sultry situation in one beyond the cold. Dafoe and Colagrande seem bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer could also take a Valium and have it done. Also, please, the women of the audience have seen WAY too many swabs used in their time, and any guy who gets excited seeing Willem Dafoe extract a bleeding swab from his wife's vagina really needs treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the film (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to Dafoe perennially sleepy what a "deconstructed jambalaya" is. (All the ingredients of the dish are still separated rather than boiled together.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: spooky house, isolated, dead spouse, disturbing violins on the score, wacky guardian who comes and goes as he likes, dead in car accidents and almost dead, characters with a secret past. Basically every click on a thriller you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything is there and never fits into a coherent plot or even an artistic mood. At the restaurant, Dafoe broadcasts "deconstructed jambalaya". The potential tenants of this casino would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf.
