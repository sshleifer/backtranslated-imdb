Burning saddles! It is a struggle between two alien brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of whom can light the fires mentally; compensate for infantile differences, with Deppy Winger caught in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (the television magician behind "Moonlighting") stifles the dark plot comedy in Vince Gilligan's screenplay with such a smooth presentation, the film resembles a voice from a student too enthusiastic with a fifteen million grant dollars. It has the pungent energy of a great commercial film, but a shapeless style that makes nothing emerge from the characters if not their bizarre eccentricities. These are not even characters, they are plot functions. Barely released to theaters, the film is a disaster, although strictly as an example of style with respect to substance, it looks good. Winger is the only protagonist of a cast that seems really perplexed. * 1/2 from ****
