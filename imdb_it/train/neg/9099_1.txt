This review also contains a spoiler for the first movie - so if you haven't seen either of the films and want but don't want spoilers, please don't read this review! <br /> <br /> While this is assumed to be the film's first meeting with Christian and Kathryn, the film is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions. Actors who played Ryan Phillippe Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are really poor substitutes. Neither of them succeeds in bringing out the attitude of a child rich in frail and haughty ones who made the original actors. It's absolutely terrifying that some of the dialogues have been textual, not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this was really Christian and Kathryn's first meeting, then why did Christian fall in love with a girl at the end of the film? He was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original film (with the character of Reese Witherspoon). <br /> <br /> In addition, the tie-in with the photograph / "You could be a model" comments In the end he was totally lame and added nothing. Overall, this film was a waste of time. I can't believe they did a Cruel Intentions 3.
