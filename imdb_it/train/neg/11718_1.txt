It's incredible!! ..yes, someone before me wrote that it was a long time to sit and watch this movie .. it is! Do not do it! I'm totally annoyed! I liked Wesley Snipes, and I found it amusing that he interpreted the meaning of his name in a movie. Anyway, I wanted to see this movie (only at home of course) but now (right after) I'm absolutely disappointed! It was his worst movie ever. Inwatchable !! Bad actor-game! Bad cameraman! Bad scenery! .. Just a good thought: that wonderful girl! It must be a mannequin for sure! Eeeeh !! MB ..10 minimum lines?! I don't want to waste you are now reading my opinion! I hope I was clear and undersized, because English is not my native way of speaking. So have some time and watch good movies, how do I feel about it too .. Peace!
