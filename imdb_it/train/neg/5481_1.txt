<br /> <br /> Not only do alien visitors look exactly like a human woman with hooded arms and not only are alien visitors able to speak English perfectly (with an Australian accent) they also call their stars with names SAME that our terrestrial astronomers gave them! <br /> <br /> And overcoming all this, all the alien life knows how petty, wicked, wasteful and destructive we humans are. And they are quite willing to tell us how ugly it is. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, don't do it. Well, unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this film or exploratory surgery without anesthesia. <br /> <br /> This film tries to get a moral, ecological point, but only manages to make you yawn and pray that it will end soon.
