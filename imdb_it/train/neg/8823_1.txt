This is one of the worst B bombings I've ever seen in my life. The ending is something you have to see to believe. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Harry Standing and Phillip Standing sitting on the stairs with his mother watching her father get out of the fireplace while wearing a Santa costume. He puts the presents under the tree, eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney. Phillip goes to bed but Harry goes down only to find his father dressed in a Santa suit that his mother likes sexually. Then, Harry climbs the stairs, breaks a snow globe, grabs a glass fragment and cuts himself. <br /> <br /> Then go to the present. See Harry. He is a lonely man who sleeps in a Santa suit and looks at small children with binoculars. He has two books. One book for good children and the other for bad children. He writes everything they do in these books. The boy is an idiot. He also works in the Jolly Dream toy factory. His brother Phillip has a family and two children and lives in a beautiful house. <br /> <br /> When Harry discovers that his boss cares only about profits, he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few children. So, he travels to a church and kills 4 people. Then he goes to another house and puts the presents under the tree. The children take it but go back to bed. So, Harry goes to the bedroom and kills his father and leaves. <br /> <br /> While walking towards a house, a group of children identify him and approach him. Parents are nervous and try to convince their children to come back to them so they don't get hurt. How do they know that Harry is the killer? Of course, you have to be suspicious because you never know who it could be. Harry gives the presents to the children and the father pulls out a switching blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the children. <br /> <br /> When Harry escapes, the city torch lights up and follows him to kill him. They don't even know he's the killer. When Harry reaches his brother's house, his brother and he talk a little and Phillip strangles him. He only loses consciousness. Phillip loads Harry into his van. When Harry wakes up, he leaves. <br /> <br /> The ending is something I couldn't believe. Once again, you will have to see it to believe it. <br /> <br /> One thing that bothered me was the black Santa. Exactly, the man in the Santa Claus suit they saw was a white man. So why did they bring a black man? <br /> <br /> Jump and watch Silent Night Deadly Night and Santa's Slay. You'll get your money's worth seeing those two movies. They are better than this pile of garbage! I give this movie 1 star out of 10. I wish I could give it 0 stars because that's what this movie deserves.
