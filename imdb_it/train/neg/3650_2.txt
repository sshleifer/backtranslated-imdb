No laughter. Yes, I saw the whole train disaster, but only to avoid asking myself if Cleese had come to his senses in the last part. (No, he hadn't.) <br /> <br /> This could be historically interesting for you young people out there, to see that British humor included black jokes like these thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> What amazes me even more is to read the comments of the other reviewers, who recognize that this is not very good, but then turn around and give it high marks. If the vast majority of the comedies you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your tortuous lives. <br /> <br /> The humor level of this show appears to be aimed at small children, yet the topic does not. So who is this for? People who like repeated and complete take-aways, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only for a short trip in '77) and other "low" moods. The three marmittoni are still fun, and they were also for me as a child. They made some effort to make the jokes work. This however is removed by the schlock. I'm afraid it's the end of civilization, if this stuff is really accepted as useful. Then you will tell me that tabloid TV is popular. :(
