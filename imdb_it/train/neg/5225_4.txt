This voice of Drummond is lacking in continuity. Many of them have their own elements of stupidity, deferred marriage and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that occur in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another. The house looks more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol which is such an obvious suspicion that no one even seems to look. He's a stranger and behaves quite suspiciously, but Drummond and the people don't seem to take anything in hand. However, it is a reasonably good action and a good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie should be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in Rathbone's films Sherlock Holmes, it's so funny that it's hard to imagine anyone having the taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became partners?
