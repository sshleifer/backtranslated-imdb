I took this movie on Sci-Fi before I went to work. If you are interested in seeing Dean Cain dive and avoid being engulfed in flames at least a dozen times, this film is for you. If this does not increase your interest, well, I fear you may wish that YOU are about to be engulfed in flames, because this film is pretty ugly. Acting, to begin with, is terrible, horrible, terrible. The characters are all completely hateful, and the dialogue is worse than your typical science fiction movie Z. Towards the end, the film began to remind me of "Hollow Man" (complete with escape through the elevator shaft), except with a Drago, not a naked and invisible man. Unlike other similar films, however, this wasn't even terribly bad ... it was simply ugly.
