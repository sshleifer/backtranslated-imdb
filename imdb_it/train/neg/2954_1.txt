I watch MANY bad movies, VERY MUCH !!!!!! It's a bit of a hobby, really. Almost every Saturday night a group of friends and I get together and watch the garbage from all over the world - NOTHING. Turkish superhero films, Brazilian vampire films, Italian gorilla transplant films, Kevin Costner films, ANYTHING (except perhaps Raising Helen), but I've never seen a worse movie than THEODORE REX. Never. And it's not even incredibly bad in an Ed Wood way - just SUCK. Now this film was famous in Hollywood when it was made because Whoopi took off his gloves and made it clear to the press and whoever else heard that she hated this piece of courage = tried to get out of his contract, she whimpered, moaned, but despite this his fat sit in this dark-skinned policeman's futuristic uniform that is horribly visible, eh! And you can only see it boil during filming, do everything but look out of the camera for his agent so she can yell at him. The dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible that a third grade class could do a better job if the cookies promised.
