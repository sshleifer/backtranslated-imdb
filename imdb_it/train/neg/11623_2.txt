From everything I read about the film, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the film was very unprofessional. Especially writing! Without writing well a film has no chance. The writer / director stated in an interview that he did not want to reveal how the title refers to the story. Believe me, it wasn't a big surprise. I kept waiting for the back-story for teenagers / young adults to take place, but it never happened. As someone who went through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This film would not have comforted me when I first experienced the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your Christian life!
