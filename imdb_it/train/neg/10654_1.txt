Great hair, big tits, bad music and a gigantic safety pin ....... these are the words to describe this terrible film in the best way. I love cheese horror movies and I've seen hundreds ... but this was supposed to be the worst ever. The plot is very thin and ridiculous, acting is an abomination, the script is completely ridiculous (the best is the final clash with the policeman and how he discovered who the murderer is - it's so damned written), the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measure, the hair is large, many boobs bounce, the men wear those cut-off t-shirts that show their stomach (nauseating that men really wear them !!) and the music is just synthesized garbage that plays and again ... in almost every scene there is trash music, tits and paramedics that take away bodies ... and the gym doesn't close for mourning yet !! Seriously, this is a really bad film, whose only charm is to look back to the disaster of the 80s and have a good laugh at how ugly it was all that time.
