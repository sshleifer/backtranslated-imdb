This ambitious film suffers most from the greatness disappointments of writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson. Highly derived from much better material ("Nashville" by Altman, "Network" by Lumet), this massive elephant takes too long to get anywhere. A couple of detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help things. Not even the irregular level of performance. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and plot could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her irresistible anguish. And how many times will we have to see Sad Sack shtick by John C. Reilly ("Chicago" and "The Hours" will be enough)? Is Tom Cruise different from the comparison? his misogynist, Holy Rail was a little fun. Speaking of impure mouth, the script was so laden with "F" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. We are not even talking about that horrible soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying voices from Aimee Mann. His extended version of "One", a maudlin number at the beginning, pushed me to distract myself at the beginning of the film. I should have listened to the handwriting on the wall and save myself for another three hours when I was pushed to the brink of hell. A saving feature, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance of the group, of the unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damned fan of coca cola on self-destruction. His credibility has far surpassed all others. This film took itself too seriously and didn't know when to finish.
