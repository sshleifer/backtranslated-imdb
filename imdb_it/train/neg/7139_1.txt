Redline is a Fast & Furious knockoff, without any redeeming qualities. It doesn't need to have a twisted plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs SOMETHING! This is the equivalent of a porn movie, where the plot and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except this is worse, because it's not worth it. Incredibly boring, impossible running sequences, and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful machines, which almost acquire negative points for appearing in this film. Sure, it's sexy, but who's so desperate for a female on screen? I feel like the director was sitting there with a hat full of dialogue and plot fragments, and he was waving an 8 ball every time the scenes changed. No serious person who runs or knows anything would have watched this movie and enjoyed the race scenes.
