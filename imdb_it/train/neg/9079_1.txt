What are people talking about here? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I left the theater. What's up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not so hard. Anyone who has illuminated this film should be taken to the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" a classic. It sits up there with such garbage as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of all time. AVOID ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would distribute money to the people who left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay it wasn't happening. Looks like I won't see that money again or the two hours.
