A sentimental school drama set in Denmark in 1969, "We Shall Overcome" offers a pathetic Danish vision of American culture. Frits (Janus Dissing Rathke), a naive and flower-obsessed thirteen-year-old, comes out with half of his ear suspended from the brutal office of master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a school director, portrayed as a fascist tyrant, has the local community under control. Lindum-Svendsen has gone too far this time, and with his father, recovering from a mental breakdown (of course, there was not enough drama already ..), and the overly stereotyped hippie music teacher Mr. Svale ('Hello, call me Freddie '), Frits stands up for justice. <br /> <br /> Tell you what. It is so unconvincing, excessively (methodically) recited, and so full of unhappiness, that as a "family" image this grotesque - full of clich√©s - excuse for a film fails miserably in convincing the non-Scandinavian public. Sorry, kind Danish readers, to crash in this way in your sentimental journeys .. But it is absolutely NOT a story about a "boy who becomes a man fighting the system". The boy never becomes a man, but rather remains a naive, bizarre frown. If you call a church of small people, led by a dictator as a cartoonist "the system", I'm sorry if I miss something. <br /> <br /> If you like family photos, go see Happy Feet instead ..
