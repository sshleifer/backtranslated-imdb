'SherryBaby' is a rather painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who has been released from prison to investigate after a drug-related sentence and fights to stay clean, to find a place in life and in particular to win back love of his daughter, who takes care of her brother's family. The only reason the film has to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the height of her career, who fits the role very well and brings the whole film on her shoulders. However, this is not enough, since the plot is too simplistic and predictable, and the emotional emphasis is put in the wrong place - I kept asking myself throughout the picture if I should be sorry for the former and maybe future addict mother as she wanted the director and screenwriter, or the innocent boy in the middle. Even the acting of Maggie Gyllenhaal couldn't convince me that I wouldn't care more about the boy.
