I'm happy to read so many negative comments about Tritter's plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like the gruff nature of House and his intelligence, but they really don't like the vindictiveness of this continuous plot. It fits the true nature of the hospital's history and makes everyone angry with the police authority. He needs to have a more considerate nature instead of revenge for everyone in the hospital. Furthermore, there seem to be many questionable legal aspects of what Tritter is actually doing. He alone cannot block the accounts and have the authority to prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the revenge he shows is hurting very sick patients at the hospital and it's not a good plot to portray. I voted the episode terribly not because of the story itself, but when you insert the piece Trittor turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt, people say they hate to see more plots. Please change it. Download Tritter.
