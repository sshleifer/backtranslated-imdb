It has its merit; Morvern Callar is both the credit and the disappointments. It is so enigmatic, so original. Is it his method of dealing with the pain of a lost person that makes her so distant and unrecognizable? Or is it like a review that called it revolutionary? Personally I would call it dysfunctional. <br /> <br /> Morvern is completely peeling off. Disposing of her boyfriend, not thinking of informing the family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral, she turns off selfishly on a trip to Spain. It looks so lacking in any relatively human bar greed. The only element that allows the public to see the human side of her is her intimate friend who takes on vacation with her. Even if her friend is eventually abandoned and Morvern has nothing to bind her to humanity. She might even have committed suicide. <br /> <br /> Although he managed to make Spain look as dull and insipid as the United Kingdom, the director's shots were superb, lighting and color made the film visually stunning. <br /> <br /> It is really a pity that the film contains nothing that keeps interest. It's just over 90 minutes, but feels much longer. They manage to make Morvern look interesting to catch your attention, but do nothing with her, alienate her from you to the point that you don't care about the characters or the movie.
