Evidently many people like this a lot, but I found it infantilizing and discreetly offensive codswallop, rescued from the forgetfulness of Jane Russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers, especially the opening (but there is a sharp decline in the invention more forward). I don't get along with Monroe - she should play a stupid blonde who isn't that stupid, but she's just stupid. Russell cannot convince when he says he has never been in a gymnasium, but it is still quite wonderful. Men are incredibly uninteresting, as is the plot. It is not atrocious at all, but so messy that, if this is a classic, God will help us all.
