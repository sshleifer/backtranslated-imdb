Someone is beaten. Right out in full view this other guy shoots him. He has bodyguards and they hit the killer, but a reporter is interested. She goes to the hospital where they took the boy who was beaten. She enters and curves a bodyguard, but doesn't want to talk. I can't understand why. It's not like anyone else is interested. She is the only journalist there. However, her editor discourages her from working on this sickly story. But hey, she does it anyway. She goes to see the murderer's sister and mother. A few minutes after they left to have a lot of time massacred ... someone blows up their trailer ... a huge fireball. Then look for the bodyguard from the hospital. She finds him hungry on his boat, but a minute later they are both underwater sucking an aquarium because three boys are trying to beat them (and they blew the boat big - a huge fireball). The reporter and bodyguard hit two of the guys who are trying to hit them. <br /> <br /> In the course of the next hour another boy is thrown against the street, there is a shootout with several shots in a warehouse, some car chases with wreckage and death, a fake suicide, etc. etc. Lotsa hard, a whole kind of carnage. <br /> <br /> Big things, but what the journalist and the bodyguard can't understand is: why in hell the original guy was beaten. What is the motivation? Of course, it could help us understand why the journalist is also interested. Through most of this he is the only reporter in history. No one else in the media worries. Not even with all the big fireballs and corpses. True, the original boy who was beaten wasn't exactly a celebrity. His work was a bit boring. He was just the president. Yes, the one who lives in the White House. Oh, and the bodyguard is a secret service agent. <br /> <br /> Is that the spoiler? <br /> <br /> It should be. After all, there are no cameras, no other journalists, no bloggers ... just another one of those police crimes ... <br /> <br /> So what's the spoiler? <br /> <br /> Let me think ... <br /> <br /> No! Wait! The spoiler is that his wife did it! Yes ... the First Lady. She was irritated because the president was joking. And she gets along. He's really strong, eh? But how on earth could he understand that? Why would anyone care? After all, only a journalist is interested. <br /> <br /> I give this move a "1". He was so stupid that I had to keep watching. And he just got dumber! This is the real spoiler! But even if I told you, you have to see it to believe it!
