He doesn't even care about this movie, it's bad if judged on his own merits, but compared to the original 1972 (which is a classic) it's terrible. And by the way, someone commented that the 1972 movie is bad compared to the book. This is silly, movies should never be judged against the books from which they are taken. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if this were necessary, but apparently it does). If you used this criterion for all films, then "2001" would suck and "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".
