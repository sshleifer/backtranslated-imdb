The early 1980s by Richard Pryor running down the street due to a fire must have hit him in some way. In his way of getting up, he jokes that he is laughing out loud. It seems he has done something that involves the projects he has chosen. The Toy is the weakest I've ever chosen, except I guess Another You. <br /> <br /> A film in which a white man buys his son a black man? A lot of underlying political inaccuracy before you was such a thing. He is seeing Richard become all sentimental which finally got me out before the end. I wanted to see Pryor getting along with this brat, instead it becomes the nauseating misunderstanding! At least Gleason has had its moments. Ignore this and look at Pryor with Gene Wilder or any other stuff from the 70s. This is a waste of time for any movie watcher!
