I enjoyed this show! I think it was nothing wrong! Except that Spidey does not beat anyone, but only for that the show does not suck! Some people just think that this show is bad for it. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! A bad Sandman never appears but I like him a little! The best Spidey show ever! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there are some episodes that were really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot that was embarrassing to watch. And I don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. Morbius's first sucks plasma instead of blood and I don't like vampires. And it annoys me that he was the main villain of season 2. Obviously I have to mention Hydro Man! It was terrible! I prefer to see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I don't like Spidey like the Spider-Man! <br /> <br /> But I guess all this was bad!
