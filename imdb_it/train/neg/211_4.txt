An incredibly obvious "drama" about a bunch of high school kids (I think) who love non-stop hip-hop, break dancing, graffiti and trying to become a DJ at Roxy - or something like that. To be completely honest I was so bored that I forgot! Even people who love music agree in saying that this film was played terribly and - like a drama - it was not a success. We should find the children nice and friendly. I found them tasteless and boring. What I really hated was Ramon. It does graffiti on subway trains and this is considered fantastic. I'm sorry? It is smearing public property that is not his to begin with. Even these "big" children draw on the city's electricity to be able to organize a big dance party in an abandoned building. Uh Huh. So we should find a group of amiable and amusing offenders. I could forgive all this if the music was good but I can't stand hip hop. The songs were - at best - mediocre and were non-stop! They are ALWAYS playing! He got to the point that I was quickly sending through the many infinite musical numbers. (Cut the music and you have a 30 minute movie - maybe) There are some fancy numbers - the subway dance fight, a really fun Santa Claus number and the Roxy climate show. If you love hip hop, here's your movie. But you're looking for a good mixed drama - forget it. Did AS also get a PG classification? There is an incredible amount of swearing in this.
