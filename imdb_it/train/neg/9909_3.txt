This was not a well done western. You have this nut that goes around the sun in a buggy with a parasol on it, killing people for its reasons. You have this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard, cutting pieces of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of a place where wolves are hunted that are not there. What's the point of this movie? Couldn't Bruce Dern find something better to do? This was a waste of movies.
