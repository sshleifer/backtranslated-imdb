Unfortunately he was misled. This film stinks from start to finish. It was hard to watch because I was watching Clarissa explaining all day about Nickelodeon. I LOVED it. Then the next thing I found was a spread in Maxim and it was wonderful! I didn't really hear anything about her until I saw this movie by accident. I could not believe that he would let something like this be seen with his name everywhere. Everything was wrong but it still seemed that someone somewhere on the team was really trying very hard to save a sunken ship. Too bad .. I hope you continue acting and I'd like to see you with a real cast in a real movie.
