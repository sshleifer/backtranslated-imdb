Protégé runs in a linear fashion; you don't expect any frantic action, and you won't even find yourself breathing heavily because there are simply no sitting moments. <br /> <br /> There isn't much of a crucial point, so don't expect either. I would not criticize the acting: the show would have been much worse had it not been for the acting of Wu, which was the only saving grace of the film. And, oh, that pretty girl too. <br /> <br /> Humor is at best weak, and the show must also pass as an anti-drug campaign using the usual shock tactics (esp scenes with Zhang) to tell us things we already know - that is, medicines break families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean, you will fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may all sound a little harsh, but I feel that the show is far from simple and somewhat uneven (* SPOILER ALERT *: take for example when Andy Lau was taken to the station police: what? I have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997 ', and THIS is the way it was captured No, no pursuit action, just a leap, which undermined the role of Wu as an infiltrator in the first place, I suspect that the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that, after all, it's a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a production company in Singapore.
