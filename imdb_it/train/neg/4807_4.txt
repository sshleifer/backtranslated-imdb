"Ambush" is not a normal action movie. It is very ugly to be ordinary. One man walks toward the other with a burning machine gun. The other man fires a shot and shoots down the man with the greatest firepower, without even a fold from the hail of lead that rains on him. Guess what the good guy is? Duh. Such is "an ambush" through and through. Not a good action movie, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels with its cast of B-movie veterans proceeding mechanically as if they knew they were a real loser. Not recommended to anyone. <br /> <br />
