Del - "You're the dumbest smart person I've ever met." <br /> <br /> Calvin- "Well, I had a brain, but they lost it in rewriting." <br /> <I think what I find most striking about this bastardization of Asimov's work is the way the character of Susan Calvin is portrayed. In books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to reflect on a problem. Here is only a damsel in distress, waiting to be saved by Wil Smith. <br /> <br /> There are references to Asimov's laws of robotics, but they are an afterthought for CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is likeable, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story is not so beautiful. You'll find out long before these brilliant characters do it.
