Gymkata is without doubt one of the worst films ever made. But not the bad kind of bad movies. This is so terrible that it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas clearly doesn't have a profitable acting career. He should go back to gymnastics. But who can forget these memorable scenes like the chalk bar, the horse with stone handles or the five-minute chase scene through the madman's village in slow motion. I don't think he was meant to be so bad, but who can say. It's not art, but if you want something quarrelsome and frothy that will make a good conversation, rent gymakta. For an evening of fun.
