Unfortunately, lower than highs. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike other modern horror films. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor / actress was exciting and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that the film becomes exciting only after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another down (or you could consider it an increase if you want) is excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the boys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not "The Dreamers". <br /> <br /> Unless you're desperate to see someone take off their swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl stay naked for no reason, or you're a huge fan of Debbie Rochon, that this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.
