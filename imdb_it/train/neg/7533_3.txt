The film has some nice aspects. Perhaps too many for my taste. It seemed that the writer / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of ALL his characters. Not once, sometimes ... but always. <br /> <br /> This is the work of television, not of cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I enjoyed the performance of Sascha Horler as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> It seemed to me that Justine Clarke's performance was weak. His reactions to things were felt forced, as if the director were trying to vocalize the themes of the film through the expressions of his protagonist. Also I can't believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the choice of pop music slapped on entire sequences. This is a lazy device, especially when pop music does not come from anywhere in the film and / or where the lyrics of the song seem embarrassing. <br /> <br /> That being said, there is a ventilated quality of the film that evokes Australian warmth and local attitude with originality. Create an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially with the use of wonderful animated sequences that save the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and artisan charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue feels so overwhelmed with work. "I wonder if there is a god? Like a guy sitting there in the sky telling us what to do" or whatever the line was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most embarrassing moments was the friend who came home from the cricket with a bunch of flowers to tell his wife "I'm quitting smoking". <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking advertisement? A TAC ad with some tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark - it was all too much.
