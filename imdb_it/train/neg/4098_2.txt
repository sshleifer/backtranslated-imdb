Although this is "better" than the first Mulva (which doesn't say much anyway, I'd rather look at the dry paint) is still crap. Do yourself a favor and avoid anything from these guys at Low Budget Pictures. I was sucked into buying some DVDs to support some indy filmmakers and I regretted it. Some have not even been officially "released" (they are not bootlegs purchased by filmmakers themselves) and I can't even list how bad they are. Avoid anything with Teen Ape or Bonejack in them as they appear in other little indy movies they are friends with. If you are friends with these guys, chances are you were in their movies and you enjoyed making them. But for those who had to watch them? There's no way. Bad video, bad sound, bad acting, bad plot ... etc Etc. These are not even funny. I only gave this 2 because Debbie Rochon is in and that's it. Perhaps it doesn't even deserve 2. About a 1 / 16th star to show that it was slightly better than the first (which I wish I had evaluated in the negatives). If you want a decent film with no budget, go get something from LBP's "friends" at Freak Productions like Marty Jenkins or even Raising the Stakes. Those are actually decent.
