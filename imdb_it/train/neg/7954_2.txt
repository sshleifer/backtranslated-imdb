OK, this movie was really "unique", we should say. Carrie Fisher was by far the most talented of the film, although he is said to have had a cocaine problem during the film. but she said she doesn't remember much. well this is his excuse, but what is someone else ??? I can't imagine everyone had a coca-cola problem. Whatever was not so bad, I suppose the plot was OK and I had some pretty funny moments. even though the part where the guy gets that thing pushed into his head was a little too violent for my taste. oh well I guess I was disappointed because Carrie's fisherman is fantastic and this movie did nothing for her.
