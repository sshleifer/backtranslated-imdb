Oh, I heard a lot about this movie. I went to see him with my best friend (she's female, I'm male). Now please leave me a difference opinion from the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen "take off your clothes", we both felt a strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (with it, not with it), we dozed off (and it would have been better to stay in bed), we were convinced that we spent money unnecessarily. And we had. The plot was inconsistent, and the characters were a group of people who couldn't be interested in it. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This film does not even deserve one in ten votes, but this is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has a reputation for being excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even a minimum of taste or intelligence.
