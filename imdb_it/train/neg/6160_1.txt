I wouldn't say this is a bad movie *. Unfortunately for me, I have the feeling that the more you know about fencing, the worse is simply due to the fact that it becomes totally unrealistic. I have fenced since I was 14, and this movie portrays very badly. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have a fencing background), but most of the other actors - especially the students - seem just lost.
