It wasn't remarkable enough to be truly horrible, it was simply incredibly lame. The story was not badly hurt, but the execution was simply horrible. <br /> <br /> To begin with, it moved too fast for us to be able to emotionally involve what was happening. It was just badly traveled. The dialogue was so bubbly, simply flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the characters, omnipotent cripes, have made Deadpool boring. How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? It wasn't even funny. He wasn't crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a pair of swords that he didn't even know how to use correctly. <br /> <br /> Gambit was boring. And since when did telekenisis to make the cards float and fly around, or super strength to jump hundreds of feet in the air? And what the hell did all the stupid moves of the helicopter do? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist in the realm of physics. A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you can't fly by spinning the super-duper fast. Which Gambit would not be able to do anyway. Neither Deadpool, especially when used as a substitute for real combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film is proof that wire work should only be used by combat coordinators who know the WTH they are doing and know best how to use it in every single one. shot. as a substitute for real fighting choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical fighters in the Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson), and some of the worst combat choreography I've ever seen in the recent memory of a movie. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left everything to the special effects boys. <br /> <br /> And then you had the escape, with all these mutants that did nothing. Even the mutants that were shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did everything when they left. Only Emma-really-lame-for-this-film-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And since when was Logan so cute? And the fool, "The bullet will take away his memory." Don't you think Xavier and the X-Men would have noticed the large bullet holes in his adamantine skull when they X-rayed X1? I felt sorry for Liev Schrieber's man, who actually brought a good Sabretooth considering the script. It made one of the simplest Marvel villains real. But he failed to save the film from his epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this was the "reckless" level of the suck. Decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible execution.
