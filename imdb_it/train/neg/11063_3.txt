I have the "courage" to inform you to stay away from "Dahmer", the biographical film based on the real life story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer 'moves farther away in relation to the mentality of its focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed over 15 young males and ate parts of their bodies, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the directors of this terrible spectacle that should have examined their heads before deciding to highlight this horrible "dahm" project. This is not an easy film to digest, although Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery starters of "brainsadillas" or even with some real "Mr." Potato peels'. * Failure
