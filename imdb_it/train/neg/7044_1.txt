How sad to see the beautiful and talented Tina Louise reduced to making this horrible excuse for a movie. Tina still looked fit and attractive, but for some reason she looks really scared. I can understand his fear; fearing that this third stinky dose would somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of the cute Adam West. Once again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in good shape for a man of his age. His acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it is difficult even to listen to the dialog box. <br /> <br /> The film is a rip-off of Brando's classic film, The Wild Ones; the band of outlaw bikers is out of control in a small country town. The bikers here seem like a heterogeneous group and we certainly wouldn't want them to go out with my sister. The acting is rigid and made of wood, and the texture is as old as the sand. Hellriders is a hell to watch!
