After reading the other reviews for this film, I believe that high markers are probably paid as studio lackeys, since the film I saw was absolutely terrible, with wooden acting, a lackluster script and predictable directorial, one of the few points in addition it must be the breathtaking scenery of this film presents some wonderful backdrops with great breathtaking views and dramatic skies and wide open grasslands, unfortunately when the most memorable thing in a film is the foreground part behind the actors this must be a warning sign for the quality of the film, all in all a really uninspiring addition to the western genre that even at the very reasonable price you can get on DVD is best avoided.
