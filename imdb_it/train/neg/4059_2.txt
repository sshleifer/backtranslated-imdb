Rarely has such an extraordinary cast been wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped aboard, only to be torpedoed by a script that looks nothing but a Hollywood joke. Attaching the name of Martin Scorsese to this was probably the draw, but the final result is much less than the sum of its parts. Resembling a nightmare that went terribly wrong, each scene seems more invented than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing but abstract, elegant, self-indulgent abstract art, and the whole film is definitely boring .......... MERK
