This past weekend I saw "28 weeks later" which was very good. After that I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I told you it's one of the most boring horrors you could ever see. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and plot. The alien creature was unreal. And the scenes of mild struggle compared to a fight in the schoolyard. And to make matters worse the boy named Cody had a loose and uncontrollable tongue that distracts attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; rather go and watch 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Mesake C.
