I just finished watching this movie. It wasn't ridiculous, but I'm really disappointed. I'm not really sure why anyone could make a film like this. It was marginally fun, but I feel like the people who did it had a lot of disagreements about what they were doing. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who takes the coffee; etc. It almost seems like they wanted to make a couple of different films, but only time and money to create one. <br /> <br /> Someone else commented that acting was really good, but I would disagree. Then again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during filming, maybe they are better actors than those to whom I give credit. <br /> <br /> The back of the DVD gives the impression that the film would be a mystery ... something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure. It starts like this, but then, from nothing, it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or ... what was that other show that wasn't so nice ... A bad episode of The Outer Limits. <br /> <br /> My main complaint about the film is that it is just so played. There is the wicked man with spiked white hair. There is the love interest, which, when it appears for the first time, the wind actually blows through his hair. Seriously. Once you realize that it is a Christian film, the end is also quite easy to spot. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been hurt, especially in the opening scenes, a way to give the maximum. It wasn't atrocious for most of the film, but there was the occasional shooting of an old lady, praying, her arms in a dark room while lightning strikes, the kind of thing that makes you a little embarrassed you're watching the movie.
