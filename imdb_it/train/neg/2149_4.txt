Well, the money machine has done it again! Disney cleverly uses idiots like me who feel that we have to own every video (good or bad) printed with the Disney moniker. Why do I keep looking forward to these "sequels" that make Don Bluth look like a bad day like Leonardo Da Vinci? Cenerentola 2 is composed of three plots (already a wrong choice!) Doesn't one of the most captivating Disney creations deserve at least a linear story? Of these three, only the last comes almost to the quality of the animation and narration that I would expect. The music is atrocious and modern (in the sense that in 2 years it will already be dated) and adds nothing to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Damn, I can't wait for the follow-up to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky's themes, we will receive music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you're listening, remember that we're not all indiscriminate children out here. How about throwing a bone or two at fans who have been around long enough to know the difference between craft and shit?
