I started watching this film while waiting for a barely tolerable Hammer horror film ... and I wasn't far away. There is a lot of blood glimpsed, and they have thrown a lot of nudity, but the last half of the film presents some ironic twists. Holy cow, they actually put some thought into the story, and they didn't fall completely into the predictable things that were expected at the beginning. And I dare say that some of the "free" nudity were not so free, because they adapted to the plot and the setting. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad film overall, but as bad movies go, it's a smarter shadow than the really horrible tripe like Lost Women and Robot Monster.
