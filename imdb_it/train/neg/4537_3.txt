I really didn't like this movie. I saw him in a field and we're not excited about it, we started laughing. Sure, some parts are moving, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible and the whole idea of ​​the film is terrible (now I know it was based on a book I didn't read, but I hope the book was better than that, because frankly, I thought this movie was very bad and boring). As I said, I went there with a group of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, I also got a caffeinated drink, but still struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me standing (apart from my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) were the shots, which were also quite useless. I just didn't like it.
