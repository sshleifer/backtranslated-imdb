Cast to die in a film that is much less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before leaving she starts telling her daughters the story of her life and her secret love ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that has the appearance and the expectations of be a great movie simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it looks like something that's not the pot-boiler that it really is. Not bad as such but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all giving good performances) you expect more than a whining story that is little more than a harlequin love story. <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
