The Incredible Melting Man sounds like an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a bit poor, but I found it impossible not to like it. <br /> <br /> The acting and the script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year movie with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes some time to melt, but when it does it's reasonably impressive; we also have an inventive death scene involving electrocution. Also noteworthy is the music, it is crazy - a mixture of cheese-tasticity tasticity. <br /> <br /> Notable highlights: <br /> <br /> * Be amazed by the slow-motion nurse who jumps through a glass panel for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Let yourself be amazed for a day in the life of a severed head. <br /> <br /> * Pay attention to the cannibal psychotic that melts humanoid. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Marvel when our hero takes a break from the lunatic chase to get a bowl of soup and complain about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This film is only 70 years old to hate it. It's gaudy and trash but I thought it was a lot of fun. You could do a lot worse.
