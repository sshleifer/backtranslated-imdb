I live in Ottawa, where this film was made and I really wish it hadn't been. This is a terrible blow from God. I really try to support independent films, but there is this stigma related to anything indie and this stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie does nothing to lose this curse. The actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, rather it evokes the tired clich√©s of the films of the past. I'm really tired of menacing characters with an evil appearance who hide in the shadows and fall prey to the unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I can remember one particular scene, right near the end of the film, where the whole scene is illuminated by car headlights. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but unfortunately it was to show the reduced budget of this film. As for a film that dares to be called horror, a spectator will find it hard to find a real cold blood, apart from some scenes with corn syrup and red dye. <br /> <br /> The most important thing that drags this film is the rhythm and the lack of development of the character, the basic plot is that the children are kidnapped and that the parents must track down this Bonesetter before a certain period of time. to get their children back. Not that this concept annoys me, but I didn't find it really credible that when the two main characters, both lost children, can find time to distinguish between them. This is done in so little time that it is inconceivable, my first priority would be to bring my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before going out with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is ... and I will not hold it against Kelly, but the film is shot entirely on boring videos, without emotions and that really takes away any moment of tension that would have simply exuded style on the film. Even though this film was given a million dollar makeover and the story and the boring acting were redone and the lame one couldn't keep this film afloat. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel, which was reported on his website, a sequel that was half written in one sitting. <br /> <br /> Lord help us all.
