I have a terrible "Boom!" Video recording, and I want to see it in all its widescreen glory. So I voted "1" and I hope you will too. Together, we can bring this movie to the pits of cinematic waste, and hope that someone can see an opportunity for BIG MONEY to release "Boom!" in its extended version of Director's Cut. The film is one of my favorite howlers, you only look at the people involved, the director, the actors, the cameraman, and you say to yourself: "Yes, I think you can make fun of someone for a long time". The producers are evaluating the release on DVD of "Boom!" it should be noted that, wherever it was shown, there were crowds of tar in the theaters. But it hasn't been up to Frostbite Falls yet.
