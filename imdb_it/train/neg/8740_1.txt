My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the biggest laughs in a while. The film should not be funny at all, but it is simply so ridiculous and devoid of any realism. First of all, Phillippe (I forgot what his character is called and I don't really care about) uses his normal employee ID to examine all the maximum security terminals. Not only is he pathetic, but he is overcome when his enormous efforts culminate in finding the scary Lego room, which houses super computers. This is simply fun. The tense mood we should try is completely ruined by the childlike room. The ending, like everything else, is very rough, especially when the bad boy's lawyer presents himself "right on time". Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to tease, definitely see it.
