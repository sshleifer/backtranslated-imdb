Oh dear! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends was screaming like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while we were playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I've ever seen in my life "and changing the" Quest "to" Test ". It's strange that I'm wrong, but actually I have wrong, he was not changing anything, he heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day, while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network would be released What was the plot of this show, so I I have ventured to watch it, and here is my answer "I WANT MY DAMN BEHIND" (Because I saw this shit and "My Gym Partner's a Monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen before, the beginning, with the stupidest song in the world, then the plot Oh, where are my manners? I did not tell the plot of this show Talk about a boy who has incredibly INTELLIGENT sisters, who have a laboratory and they experiment with their brother OHHH, now I understand why it's called Johny TEST, is the test of his experiments on sisters. <br /> <br /> You know, honestly I miss Dexter's La b (before it was turned into the NEW Dexter, even a total crap). This is a bad copy of that old show, except that this show is incredibly bad. Don't watch it, do something more productive in that half hour than watch this shit.
