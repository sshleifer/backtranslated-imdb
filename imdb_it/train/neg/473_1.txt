This is what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour. He was unable to avoid snoozing. I had talked about how execrable it was and in the end I gave in and played, having finished the adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine if you do, the apex of the hack-work. Something so uninspired, so terribly frightening, that all you want to do after seeing it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work with the illusion that this film is watchable. It is not, not in any form of narcotic or brain damage. I would recommend it to someone ONLY to help them understand how unbearable it really is. You do not believe me? Collect everything. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a nation, we in America do not always represent Middle Eastern peoples in a refined way. But how about a child with a sheikh dress who bows in a salaam style to a pile of bottles of Castrol motor oil? You'll find it here. TAKE IT? HER ARABA OIL. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Having a child flying planes in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their right mind would think it was a funny joke? It's not even close to "cleverly offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to hit anyone who's been paid to write that piece in your face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, a group of five singers called "Landmines" takes the stage of an official dance. Okay, are you ready? The joke is that they sing terribly and out of line. Why did I write it in capital letters? Because the joke is POUND, POUND, POINTED INTO HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS sight gags. They start quite mediocre; glasses that break, glasses of punch that shatter ... then there is, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence from A WOMAN'S SHOES COMING OFF. You read that right - the music was so bad, in one frame, the woman's feet have shoes. In the next - the shoes are off !!! Take it, because the music was so bad, his shoes came off! What F ???? <br /> <br /> Then there is an endless assembly of archive material to bring home the point that the SONG IS POOR. If any human being had actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be amazed. This film is honestly a practical joke to see how fast people close their doors. Robert Downey Sr. directs the play in the way his son commands respect by remaining drug-free. Bad. Other things to watch out for: <br /> <br /> 1. Popular music can be downloaded in all cases. Every time Liceman appears, he plays a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song. Moreover all the actors do their best to behave as if it were really cold for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's horrible accent. He seems to be trying to talk like a child while rolling a marble on his tongue. There are no nude scenes, and there are several scenes in which the boys complain and contort themselves from undertaking his split, as if they were in an acting class in a community school and have been directed to behave like retarded aroused people . <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his revolting dog like a condom. Remember; when this movie was released, launching "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "edgy". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a hungry and hungry child pedophile when Hollywood thought "pedophile" and "homosexual" were one. Embarrassing flat-out. <br /> <br /> 5. Watch the finale. There is nothing wrong with your VCR. This is actually the ending. Tell me it doesn't make you want to blow up everyone who's ever made a movie, ever. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk. Up The Academy has been known to make other films, such as The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less fun simply by placing the videotape near them.
