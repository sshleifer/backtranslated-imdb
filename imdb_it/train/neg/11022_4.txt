In his way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, entitled Hallam Foe? I can't see his character "mister" title), is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell, like Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, like Kate, her vicious partner in love and fantasy, are convincing. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to whatever happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives like Hallam does would deservedly be beaten to a pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be rejected and scared - she'd probably call the police. <br /> <br /> These things are not, however, what happens in the film. Poor Hallam's mother died and his father married a woman with whom he had an affair. Hallam obviously hates his stepmother and lets him know. She has sex with him. Kate is a kind of employed person who places Hallam in a dishwasher and plays sexual games. Looks like his natural mother. Everything ends happily with Hallam who "solves" his "problems". Forty years ago, the comedy and brilliantly played film, Virginia Woolf's Who's Afraid, had an equally optimistic ending, with the characters making themselves wiser and better after being torn apart. The problem is that it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the ending is plausible due to the intensity of emotional revelation. In Mister Foe, emotional revelation never really happens.
