This film is an idiotic attempt at a sort of action thriller. A bus tour to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white garbage hijackers driving dune buggy. They hunt them in the desert and then steal all their valuables. The plot changes constantly. One minute they are trying to kidnap a rich daughter, the next they will look for a $ 90,000 stamp. The dialogue is horrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
