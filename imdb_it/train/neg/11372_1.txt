I have been using IMDb for years and have never wanted to get involved in film commentary so far. This documentary has so many problems that I don't know what to say. I am not a Muslim, nor am I an expert on Islamic studies, but I know enough to shed light on the obvious one-sided point of view that this documentary embraces. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film begin with the fact that it is a documentary. Most of the documentaries I've seen anchor around some valid points and then surround those points with questionable interpretations and misinformation. This is certainly the case with Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, there are fundamentalists all over the world, and some of them are Muslims, but building a documentary on all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading. This is really a documentary on the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more. <br /> <br /> For those who would like to explore more objectively some of the issues raised in this documentary, here are some points that can help. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside that region. More Muslims live in China, believe it or not, than in Saudi Arabia. About 40% of all Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Koran used in the documentary is questionable. I saw the documentary while watching another translation and the differences were surprising. I had been advised of the translation used in the documentary and now I know why. Surrah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that the unbelievers will go to hell. But the translation I read instead: "Those who reject the Truth between the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in the fire of hell". The difference is that those who reject the Truth are those people who know God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The film says that there is no morality inherent in Islam, but this is not true. Although it is true that much comes from the Koran and the Hadith, Islam also recognizes a concept called "Urf" or "normative behavior". Obviously what is normative can be interpreted in many ways, but "Urf is thought to be a" good "behavior, what a normal person would consider right or wrong. <br /> <br /> The documentary presents Shar'ia ( Islamic law) as a unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow. This is simply not true. There are many schools of Islamic law ranging from the progressive and the modernist to the fundamentalist in the way they interpret the law. <br /> < br /> The Hadith tradition is similar: There are thousands of Hadiths and each law school accepts some and rejects others.Using the Hadith without a serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate, real and applicable, is indiscriminately choose and choose quotes from the story that fit what you want to say - which is what the documentary did. <br /> <br /> What I hope people understand is that fundamentalism is the problem, not the Islam or any other religion. Christianity has the fundamentalists who shoot abortion doctors and so on. I know this is not the same as a suicide bombing, I just understand that the rectitude of fundamentalism is probably the problem. If you feel you have the answer, then everyone else must be wrong. But if you feel you have an answer, you can work together with other people's opinions on politics, religion, God or anything else.
