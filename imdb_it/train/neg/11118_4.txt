This was a popular film probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, a losing character that closes all the fans, etc. The funny thing is that you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you replaced someone but "white" like anything else would be considered racist by the PC police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be good if not better than any black basketball player, is as interesting as his principal counterpart Wesley Snipes is. <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of funny lines put down, providing a lot of humor. The negative part of the film - which does not bother many people - is the extreme vulgarity in this film and the cheekiness of all the characters. This includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean and nice people in this film. For this reason, I cannot honestly recommend the film, at least not to friends or to those who are offended by many bad words.
