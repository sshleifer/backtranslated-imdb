It might be a bit hard for me to say, but unfortunately so far in his career as a director he is true. Just take a look at what you've done so far. They can barely pass the 3-star mark. <br /> <br /> Why did I see this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes play Greg Grunberg. Lucy was exceptional in this film, her performance brings the whole film. I hope you get a "blockbuster" and break into the biggest series of actors, you clearly have the skills. Greg was not so impressive, typical television acting style. <br /> <br /> The film is strangely classified as a horror. The only "horror" is a brief flashback, and they last a maximum of 2-5 seconds with some blood in them. Personally I would call this a "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story, bad direction, editing and acting (appart. From Lucy) destroys it. You don't get a real connection with the actors, something that is very important in a story like this. You sit there watching without hearing anything. It's like watching a bad TV soap ... actually I think TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: stay away from this movie ... or better yet stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with.
