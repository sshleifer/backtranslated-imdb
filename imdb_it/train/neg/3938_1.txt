Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish from a movie. To begin with, the script was definitely written to be turned into a B movie, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a stellar vehicle to rise from television) and Hutton (looking for the "two" of a "one-two punch" he had hoped to define his career after "Ordinary People" who became attached to the film. Poor lines, big wipes from one scene to another (Come on - who uses the wipes after the twelfth Telecommunication class?), And the simple bad acting sinks this film. Also Duchovny is not immune to the plague of bad acting which is this film. Only Timothy Hutton is above the material. I have to admit that I felt Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voiceover. While I found myself laughing when I was sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the punch line of Duchonvey's dubbing: "if you need a doctor, make sure you call 911." If only the studio had called 911, this movie dog would never have been made. Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
