I'm not going to waste time writing a theme and wasting your time. I would like to say, however, that all those who are intent on watching this film have been totally ridiculous. Johnnymacbest, you can't play that card, and I mean the patriotic card of nationalism, to keep people from watching this movie. this is a film that expresses its free will in this country (oh yes, I played that card) even if the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches a camera, but the world is full of controversy, and it's the same thing you heard before, like the GTA controversy. It's a comedy, you laugh and be disgusted, not all disgusted together, its dark humor and obviously you don't have the heart to take it, the past is past, yes people remember who was lost but it's time to move on, that was !!! 7 !!! Years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Also am I crazy and who needs a soul?
