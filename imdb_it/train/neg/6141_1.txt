One night I was waiting for my friends to return to the apartment and "Gymkata" was on; I watched too much. It's really fun and really terrifying. Think of it this way - if you had an idea for something so bad in your work and you kept doing it in a terrible way like this, how long would you last exactly? Not as much as this movie. It is a must see, of course.
