This is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context for events and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused and clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the director's comment. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot to do with human atrocities and tries to show how wrong it is, with an emphasis on child abuse. Includes some footage of real and horrific acts of violence, including wartime executions. Even if it works in the context of the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is NOT for the faint or easily offended stomachs at all, and should under no circumstances be shown to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climatic with respect to the content of the rest of the film. If you're not listening to the comment as it happens, you'll probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-shot, "sit the guy down and let him talk, no cuts" kind of comment. Although this is not necessarily negative, the director often ends up in disruptions and often spends a few minutes at a time complaining about his college, shooting conditions, producers, bad movies and a dozen other things. Constant negativity distracts from what is otherwise an essential tool for understanding the film. <br /> <br /> The film was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 film for a period of four years with an extremely low budget. For this reason, the quality of video and audio is poor. This alone doesn't make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
