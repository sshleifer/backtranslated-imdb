I was very excited about this movie when I first saw the previews. Normally I see such a good preview and I buy the film outright. Something told me about ... you can watch it first. I'm glad I did it. Keira Knightley has ruined all future films for me with this role. In the movie 2nd Pirates when it came out, I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated him more for it. I think it has to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino. <br /> <br /> I dominate who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't know or I'm really interested. I don't know who he was in real life or who he was in this movie. I didn't care about his character and even Keira, who was particularly naked, wasn't worth it. The management was definitely lacking. The writing was trivial and superficial. The assembly was horrible. I don't care about style as much as the excessive excessive use of it. There is a place for this. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing (I don't know if there's an official name) would be Fight Club; just out of my head. Even the enemy of the state had a semi-similar style of assembly. It was used with taste and was not used as a crutch. I mean it's the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who liked this movie. I imagine the idea that you completely love this movie or that you completely dislike it is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.
