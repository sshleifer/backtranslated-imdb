This film is a mess. I'm surprised he also has a theatrical version. Without Robin Williams he would have gone directly to the video. It is poorly written. It's badly directed. The worst offense is that he has taken an interesting topic and reduced to a ridiculous thriller and BORING that has no emotions, no suspense and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour the film is part of a series of ridiculous pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not full of suspense and there are no chills - in fact the worst thing about the movie is that it's simply boring.
