If this movie was a comedy, I would have given a 10. Oh my, where do I start? Let's put it this way: I saw a lot of terrible horror films, but this makes Troll 2 look like a fool. 'Save Private Ryan. It is as if a group of porn film producers decided to make a horror movie, changed their minds halfway through production and decided to make a comedy, then returned to horror, and then decided they should be limited to porn (softcore). Everything about this film is simply terrible: the soundtrack (someone shot the guy who invented the Yamaha keyboard), the script, the direction, the cinematography, the acting. There are simply no words to describe it. Oh wait, yes there are: Holy $ *%!.
