Now I've seen all four Bo Derek vehicles driven by her husband, John; all are quite terrible, of course, but this is certainly the hole. With the usual inconsistent plot, bad script ?? by the director, of course ?? and acting, not to mention the star's free nudity, takes care of her losing much older husband Anthony Quinn (he accepts his suicide with a shotgun saying he has always admired Hemingway !!) but that continues to appear and speak with her. In reality, he wants to return to another younger body, but in reality he does it only in the last scene! Derek is as adorable as ever, and continues to play naive (!) ?? especially during an intermediate section that has been persecuted by a hit man in a spa. Quinn is also typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but this is easily his nadir; besides, for most of the duration, it acts from behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably suggesting that it is in a kind of limbo)! His 'substitute', therefore, is obviously an attractive-looking stallion who doesn't have a lick of talent or personality. The cast also includes Hollywood veterans Don Murray (like Quinn's best friend and Bo's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (like Quinn's guardian angel in the afterlife) ?? plus an amazing cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who supposedly needed this in his resume ')! Also, John Derek was his director of photography in the film, which the credits are full of useless (and mushy) expressions of gratitude for the many people who helped and who GHOSTS CANNOT DO. the council at the 1990 Razzie Awards!
