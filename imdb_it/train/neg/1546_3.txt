I rented this movie for a few laughs. I had never seen the SNL skit, but with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World, it couldn't be that bad, right? The answer: it was. This film was certainly not a way to relax after a hard day's work. I just waited for a plot and a fun part, but there were none. The highlight was tiffany amber thieson, and that's it.
