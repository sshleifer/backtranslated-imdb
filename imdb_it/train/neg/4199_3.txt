Very little effort that offers virtually nothing to anyone but a huge Stanley Tucci fan, who tries, but cannot save the poor structure, dialogue, direction or talent of our protagonist. <br /> <br /> Practically the only trick of this misleading tale of a naive new seller of an alarm company, are its extravagant secondary characters. But without a realistic background, these characters are useless. <br /> <br /> Nothing to see here, keep moving ... <br /> <br />
