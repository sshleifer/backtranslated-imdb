I buy or at least watch all the Seagall films. He came out with a handful of good movies and then went down in poor stories, a bad job with the camera and a walking character, he almost lost me. Some movies do remembered how to make a decent movie. Now it's forgotten again. This film is seriously obscure (at whatever level you want to name). There is a lot of slash and gash here without a recognizable purpose unless it is intended as a warning to the army. <br /> <br /> Seagall may have had a guess for many of his scenes because it was often too dark to say and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Unfortunately the only interesting character was the villain who killed his guard to escape custody and then proceeded to create confusion everywhere. Do you agree since we place an armed guard in the detention room with a prisoner? However this bad boy was at least colorful and very concentrated. There's a lot of blood if you like that king of things. It seemed to me that the bad guys tore the same gash every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their unfortunate victims. I call you back to my summary. Basically it's a horror movie disguised as an action movie. Dec 6,2006
