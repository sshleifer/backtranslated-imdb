After finishing the book the same day I watched the movie, I knew what would happen. I had high expectations for the film due to the evaluation. The only reason I gave this 2 in 10 star movie is that it was okay trying to be a movie. I have a couple of main points to not like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson barely fits the character of Jack Torrence. Besides, I would never have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I imagined Wendy very differently. I can understand why they chose Jack Nicholson, the smile, the pointed eyebrows, but it shouldn't really look "bad". It should look normal, and it becomes bad. Also, they make one of the worst movie pairs. Danny was fine, but he needed more life. He acted in a drunk way. <br /> <br /> 2. The script They cut so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book I was anxiously waiting for in the movie have been deleted, changed or mishandled. Some of the things that were in the book that I couldn't wait to see (the hedge animals, the roque bat, the elevator) weren't in the movie, and they were 2 hours and a half !! I was extremely irritated. <br /> <br /> 3. The finale. The end was completely changed, Halorann is dead, Jack has stuck to death, Wendy has never been hurt ... The Overlook has not exploded. The Ending was so beautiful in the book, and the film messed it up so horribly, I was stunned. Hallorann should never have died, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack would use a roque mallet. You've never seen a mallet throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things that I don't like about the movie, but there are things that were fine. The camera angels were fantastic, the blood coming out of the elevator (it didn't happen in the book) was nice, but maybe I was too irritated because the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared. I recommend reading the book before seeing this film. I congratulate Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract for no longer Stanley Kubrik. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights I could have screamed at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
