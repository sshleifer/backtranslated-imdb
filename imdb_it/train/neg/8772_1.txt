There is nothing new to say for me: 4 hours of people dying over and over again in the same hill. The cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / god was wrong. He should have eaten a humble cake (if not for his sake then for the men who died in Kargil), hire one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hire a real writer, hire a real publisher, hire a musician who was not related somehow (and who seemed to have heard some bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian drugs), he hired a real professional team, threw away all the fireworks and told a true story. Unfortunately, like the heavyweights of the Indian Army, he made terrible decisions for his actors and terrible for his audience. We are all dead over and over again. <br /> <br /> Please, don't do it again, sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: The next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest hiring more than one Nepalese to represent the team. Surely there are many Nepalese men working in Bombay - the last count was between 40,000 and a half million.
