This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was watching this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was ugly and there wasn't a single nice character. I could get more entertainment by looking static. I gave this film a 1 just because the scale didn't go to negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
