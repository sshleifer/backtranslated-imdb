It is worth watching this movie if you are amazed at the special effects. There are some interesting images. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it is typical of the 90s / hollywood to make a bolt of glare without substance. True to the title. <br /> <br /> It is not worthwhile to choose the story. It's like performing a brain operation on a dinosaur. There's not much to begin with. It is nothing original and not very special. So don't go in for the story. Just look at the effects. <br /> <br /> As has been said, in the end it appeared a little flashy, diluting the purity of the great FX treatment of an invisible (and sometimes invisible) man. However, if you ignore the "standard" pyrotechnic, it is a sight to be seen (or not to be excluded). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an FX movie worth seeing for that purpose and this alone.
