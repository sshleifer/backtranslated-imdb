This movie sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely unlikely. In short, these people are "terrified" by this pathetic "crazy killer", but completely fail to react in any way. And this after they took a raft during a camping trip, without tools, and they showed up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters' headphones. Furthermore, after their boat has disappeared, they panic about being stuck in the woods, but then their daughters' boyfriend shows up and apparently never thinks they could just come out of the woods like he did to get to them. As I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend call you to watch it.
