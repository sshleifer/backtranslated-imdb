Jungle Fever is too stylized, stereotyped and presents itself as essentially dishonest. Wesley Snipes was wrong about the command and there was no connection between him and Annabella Sciorra. Although there is a lot of talent in this film, it's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos. Furthermore, instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing, Spike Lee chooses to wave it like a flag in a whining and irritating manner. I passed most of the film but I couldn't finish it, and this rarely happens to me.
