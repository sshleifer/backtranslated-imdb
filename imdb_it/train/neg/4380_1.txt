Plot: a loving couple decides to engage in some extra marital hijink in a flashy car. Then they get stuck (literally) in a compromised position, while the car moves aimlessly through the countryside until the unfortunate couple is saved by the authorities. <br /> <br /> Done. This is the whole movie. There may have been dialogues here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious now that this film is not only useless, but actually physically painful to watch. The fact that he starred in two of the UK's best emerging actors (one of whom has sadly passed away) only adds to the horror. <br /> <br /> Ian Charleson distinguished himself in the much-deserved Oscar - winning 'Chariots of Fire'. Let us remember him for that role, and we strive to pretend that this particular celluloid abomination never happened.
