I thank God I didn't go to the cinema for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on TV and couldn't believe my eyes. I wonder if any films could be worse than this. they spent millions of dollars on this film for nothing. horrible acting and terrible scenery. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man who works at that movie company;) it's a very big fiasco! in 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of film? embarrassing...
