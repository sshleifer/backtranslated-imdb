Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, revolves around three "couples" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Start good enough for me. Interesting. Couples are divided into a heterosexual couple, two male heterosexual friends and a straight guy who is "harmless" pursued by a homosexual. <br /> <br /> The "het" couple really don't have much role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when they have sex or play together, but they seem to have no real purpose since they are so marginalized. My hypothesis is that they represent a more everyday illustration of how sex / violence is integrated into a couple's life. The couple is not very aggressive and is not even fired in any way erotic. As characters, they don't add much to the theme or plot. <br /> <br /> The two male friends make up most of the plot. They engage in some kind of gay homicide by convincing a homosexual to have sex with them in an alley. This turns into violence. And violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need to release violence grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is that violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that some of the characters are in real danger. It just doesn't work. Since the whole theme of the film is about the relationships of characters with violence, this is a big problem. Unfortunately, makeup doesn't help either. Sometimes it's okay, other times it's very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had lipstick smeared across his face. Confusion. <br /> <br /> The most interesting pair of characters is the "pair of stalkers". Here Calson seemed to have more things to say and was able to develop a more coherent plot. Maybe it's because the characters seem to develop more and have a resolution at the end. Shiner may have been a lot better if he stayed with these two. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It's admirable. Most low-budget films do not aspire to much. I don't think Calson has achieved his goal. I found nothing particularly controversial or disturbing. Shiner was not convincing. This does not mean, however, that the director cannot achieve something with his next film. <br /> <br /> It seems to have something to say.
