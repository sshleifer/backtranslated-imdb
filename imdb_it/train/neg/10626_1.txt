this documentary is based on sponge cake as soon as you put a real test on it the integrity is slowly reduced in a large pile of shit, for example Bart Sibrel states that they must have had more light sources because the shadows seem to cross if this was the case there would not be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 passed through the Allan van radiation belts that spent 30 Min there not the 90 Min claimed in the documentary and received a radiation dose more equivalent to that of an x ray. <br /> seriously some research to find out what happened really don't let this pile of documentary crap print your opinion on what really happened
