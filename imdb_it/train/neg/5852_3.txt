Bradford Dillman plays a scientist who wakes up one morning in the middle of a bloody crime scene; having a partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", which a character claims to define elective memory loss), the scientist finds a private detective in the column in the hope of recomposing his life together. A horrible concoction based very loosely on the book by Walter Ericson "Fallen Angel" (shot in 1965 as "Mirage" with Gregory Peck). It was probably too vivid for television - the one with drugs and hippies added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to broadcast it, which is how this low-budgeter ended up in theaters. Director James Goldstone goes mad with hyperkinetic images and camera tricks, while publisher Edward A. Biery goes crazy with zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their explicitly colored tricks cannot cover the weak points of this updated plot, and the acting is sadly too mature. Dillman, under pressure to remember the events of the night in question, goes through a seminar of tic actors, stuttering, wipes and crazy laughter as he spits out a dialogue like, "Dream ... a dream ... drugs ... yes , drugs ... SOUND ... bells ... help! "As an infamous fellow student with a Cheshire Cat smile, Pat Hingle is almost on Dillman's stage in the Grand Thespian department, constantly addressing everyone in the baby talk , wandering like a middle-aged peacock and twisting his mouth in agony. Hope Lange's scientist / loving love receives a small drift, but not before she cries out to the indifferent lover Dillman: "What should I do, Ape Man speaks? I want you!" This is a frantic "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 from ****
