What's happening to RGV? It seems to repeat itself in every film. Are you short of creative ideas? If he has it, it's time to take a back seat. I went to watch the film with great anticipation - obviously not once I imagined that it would be close to the original. I knew it wouldn't happen, the promos said it all. But even then I thought it would be a real pleasure for RGV, after all, isn't it the same guy who ran Sathya and Company? Or is he? I have my doubts after seeing Aag. I won't talk about the plot or the plot, since most of it is taken from the original, if you're dying to go see this, you could play a fun game with friends: identify the scenes from the original one and give personal votes ! So Veeru becomes Heero (how trivial?), I suppose Heeru wouldn't sound so good. Ajay Devgan is rather a disaster like Heero, the comedy is tense and the chatter that was really effective in the Company's sounds is fake. The chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari) does not exist at all. In fact, the most charming Nisha tries to be the most irritating she becomes. This reaches a peak by the end. Raj is not really bad compared to others, he is a guy to look at in the future. I was really disappointed by Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, it looks like a caricature of Gabbar Singh. There's a scene where he's drinking something from a shawl-covered bowl, instead of inspiring fear, he looks like a beggar with his bowl. The only performance that really stood out was Mohan Lal as Narasimha inspector. I'm afraid I don't have the patience to write more.
