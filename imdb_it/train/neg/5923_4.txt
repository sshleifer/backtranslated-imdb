During the civil war, there were many cases of divided loyalties; obviously, many occurred "in the border states", where the north met the south by coincidence with geography. From the border, young father Owen Moore leaves for the Union Army. Shortly thereafter, Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separated from his regime, wanders the enemy's property, desperate for water; finds an escort where Unionist's young daughter Gladys Egan sits. When the Yankee soldiers track him down, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate hideout. Later, when she returns to kill her father, the child's kindness is remembered. A sweet and small story by the director D.W. Griffith. The footage of the location and humanity are shown lovingly. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (13/6/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
