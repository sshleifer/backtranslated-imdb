The forest is not only your standard cannabale stuff of all time, but it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two couples walking in the forest on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibal woodcutters and the ghosts of his deceased wife and two children soon terrorize them. There's something you don't see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an "A" for the effort even though the film itself is flat on almost all levels, the acting is just average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead woodcutter's wife (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent) . /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking in a valley and a forest. They realize too late that someone is persecuting them. Both are shipped in the typical slasher rate. Our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the movie, except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw, a pitchfork and a rusty blade to send his wife's lover who betrays him. <br /> <br /> The forest has a good plot but the film does not work and I found it rather boring with simply crappy acting. 4/10
