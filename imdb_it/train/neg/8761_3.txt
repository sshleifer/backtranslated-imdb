My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies that nobody has ever heard of. Of course, sometimes it led to some fun discoveries. Often, the best that can be said is that they certainly last an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> He brought home "Advice From A Caterpillar". She was excited because the box said it was fun. Fortunately for us, the propaganda on the boxes never lies. <br /> <br /> This film was an exercise in patience. This is one of those movies where, unless you're a pretentious and superficial person who likes to watch movies on you, you'll hate every character in the movie. Until the introduction of the beautiful character. Which annoying and annoying character will fall in love and act in such a way that, in the real world, it would take anyone away. <br /> <br /> MOON SPOILERS FROM HERE ON <br /> <br /> So a group of emotionally dull, arrogant and pretentious artists swear love and find success in their careers. Then, they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving (almost perfect boy) character. Then we look at the woman, the annoyingly pretentious artist (in her 30s?) Out of her mind when she falls in love. So she tries to escape from the handsome, intelligent, emotionally mature man and be with the married man with whom she had a big but empty sex. He is rude to the man and does everything in his power to drive him away. In the real world, it would have been quite successful. I certainly wanted to run away from her and I didn't even have a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it's nice that the man fought for his love, I never wanted her to have him. (Not even my girlfriend) He didn't deserve it. And, because I wonder, did the director think that the "almost perfect guy" should be punished by having a relationship with her? When the artist was asking the "almost perfect boy" to leave, we were screaming because he too was going away. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the film is so annoying, childish and stupid that it fails. <br /> <br /> Besides that, let me tell you that Andy Dick made me laugh a few times even though his character was also pretentious to the point of annoyance. As for the other characters, they were well played, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laughed a few times in the film. Unfortunately, not much laughter happened until the last 10 minutes or so. But when I had those laughs, I had prayed for the film to end too long. I needed to get these characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the people you hate fighting with a love for people you don't deserve, then this is the movie for you.
