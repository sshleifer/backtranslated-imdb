This film was practically a waste of an hour and a half of my time. Generally I like cheap horror monster movies, but this film was a disappointment. The main flaw is the lack of explaining the creatures. When they entered the house and found the man he could rent, he explained them. He doesn't say anything about them except that they killed his parents, and if I didn't miss something he didn't say how he managed to escape ... Without mentioning the fact that he doesn't give any clue or why the only survivor remains and basically feeds the creatures after his near-death experience. It would have seemed like he would have had the opportunity to leave after "the cross accident".
