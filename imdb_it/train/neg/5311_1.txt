This is almost the worst movie you've ever seen! 2012 Doomsday currently pulls the rug out of this for me. The props are a perfect example of what Frank Zappa called "cheepnis". It seems that the space scenes were made in a 1950s power plant, just before the demolition. Music really sucks. The acting is in wood and ham. The characters they portray are superficial and unconvincing. The plot is predictable. It is immediately and blatantly obvious when they copy techniques and ideas from other films. The quality of the direction is a beggar belief. <br /> <br /> But you have to see it, if only to experience what must be one of the biggest waste of a tiny budget ever. This is a priceless example of a stupid movie!
