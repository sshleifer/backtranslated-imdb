It was nice to see some of my favorite stars from 30 years ago including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked wonderful. But it was so. They were not given any characters or good jokes to work with. I didn't understand or care what the characters were doing. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller female roles were fine, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were quite competent and confident in their small secondary parts. They showed a certain talent and it is sad that they did not perform in better and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think that Dorothy Stratten had the chance to act in this unique important cinematographic role. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have some fans, and I was very open when I started watching it. I'm a big fan of Peter Bogdanovich and I enjoyed his latest film, "Cat's Meow" and all his first films from "Targets" to "Nickleodeon". So it really surprised me that I could barely stay awake watching this. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that this film is about a detective agency where detectives and clients are romantically involved with each other. Five years later, Bogdanovich's ex-girlfriend, Cybil Shepherd, had a hit television series called "Moonlighting" that stole the idea of ​​history from Bogdanovich. Of course, there was a big difference in the fact that the series was based on tons of witty dialogues, while this one tries to settle for slapstick and some screwball lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It is not no "Paper Moon" is just a very clear version of "What's Up, Doc".
