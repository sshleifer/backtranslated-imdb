Don't be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just extra glorified. Their scenes were probably shot in a day or so. Whatever their motivations for being in this film, if you have an actor like James Woods it is better that you make good use of him. For me this is a sign of bad direction through and through. The plot itself wasn't so bad. And the acting of most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. however was terrible. It was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was meant as a serious film that can't be a good thing. The action scenes weren't bad, but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting. Again better direction was needed. Even the pace was wrong for a film like this. The main character took almost half an hour to get into action. For an action thriller of just 90 minutes it's too slow. The only saving factor is Angie Harmon. He does his best to make everything work. Too bad the director left it hanging. Yes, this film could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as a director to make it. And for an action / coordinator of his stunts you'd expect at least more exciting action scenes. Don't waste time with this. To avoid!
