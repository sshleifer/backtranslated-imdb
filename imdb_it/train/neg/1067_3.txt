Only a handful of segments are working here. A segment with a garage worker from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent and Bob Hoskins makes his point of view, turning it from time to time until the last shot turns things upside down. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that only some clips invoke Paris. The others are so scattered in theme, tone, volition and production that you can also watch "The Years Best Commercials, 2006." It's really everywhere. It does not develop during the execution time, and nothing reigns in the directors. No construct successfully joins the pieces ... the tedium is established. I'm at the hour, twenty minutes point and Elijah Wood is in some stupid, over-commercial vampire vampire, overproduced. It has a lot to do with Paris like the old ladies knitting in the Antarctic. The fantasy is presented I believe first in the segment of the Coen brothers (Uh, thanks to J & E for ruining another film) and then I made too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you don't need fake shit to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it by neighborhood if the Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with the vampires of some loser director? There has never been a more over-represented genre than the vampire movie. Every three years we receive the same lame vampire cliches. <br /> <br /> The worsening of things is that the transition from one segment to another is rather lacking in art. Transitions are lost. This does not feel intentional, it feels sloppy.
