First of all, I'm not here to make this movie. I find it totally enjoyable despite the poor quality of production. Acting here is as abominable as the monster that chases them, though the monster itself is rather well done ... incredibly well done to that. In fact it seems a bit like another world, like an alien family on vacation landed in the Himalayas and while dad was out taking a ... participating in the call of nature, Spot got free and they didn't have time to chase him. That, or is the Caucasian brother of the Wishmaster. I have not yet decided which one. <br /> <br /> Actually, it looks like it was shot somewhere in the snow country, yes, but more likely in Canada, somewhere, than in China, anywhere. The trees and the views tell me Canada, and it's okay that the area never looks like the look or coldness you'd expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we can forgive the lack of position. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, apparently (as we have just established) science fiction directors do not travel often, since they are not aware that commercial planes fly over time like what is described in this document and the resulting accident in reality would not have happened. But like I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie, so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The film is quite graphic, sometimes, and it turns between "Alive" on the Donner Party, "Predator" about the alien in the woods and every bad wushu movie in which they fly around on wires. Apparently the Yeti can jump like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster, jump higher, live longer!" <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the Yeti has lost its teddy bear. He searched up and down for this, but it doesn't seem to make a corpse work. Poor Yeti! You can't help but I'm sorry for that. It has survived and evolved for thousands of years just to succumb to the severe loss of the teddy bear. He lost his bear. Or maybe he wants to mate, but that thought is BANISHED! Can you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unclassified male. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But then again, what is normal-Yeti? I don't know, but it has a definite quality of Michael Meyers that is completely unsettling. And he has this fabulous way to clean his fur. FABulous Dahlink! It's perfectly white sometimes when SO shouldn't be. It is annoyingly superhu -... super-Yeti. <br /> <br /> All in all? This was a lot of fun to watch, it has some great killings and some honest plot elements. Despite the horribly gravel production style, this is actually quite fun. Can't help wondering if they are planning another? <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV scale. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 4.4 / 10 on the scale of the movie from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon:.
