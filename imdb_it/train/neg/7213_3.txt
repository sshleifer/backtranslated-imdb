While I certainly consider The Exorcist a classic of horror, I must admit that I don't consider it so high as many other horror fans. As a result of this, I have not seen many of The Exorcist's scams, and if Exorcism is something to go on, I will have to say that it's a good thing because this film is boring to die for and certainly not worth spending ninety minutes on its! In all honesty to the other exponents of the exorcists, this is often considered one of the worst, and therefore perhaps it was not the best place to start. It is not difficult to guess what the plot will be: basically it is the same as the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl become possessed by a demonic spirit (which is the spirit of her late father). The village priest is then called to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this is played by Paul Naschy, which is pretty much the best thing about the movie. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the Spanish derivative Yellow 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I didn't see any of his other films, but based on these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strengths. There are not many good things I can say about the film itself; mostly just limping and the exorcism scene is not worth the wait. I certainly don't recommend it!
