This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Has the Avengers held this honor questionable ?? but not anymore. The acting in "Jill the Ripper" is terrible and has only been eclipsed by the plot. This film is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. He doesn't know if he wants to be an S & M movie or a really bad thriller. Look only in case of extreme drunkenness or if you are in bed and need a distraction covered in leather. This script should be reworked into a porn, it would not take much effort and would have a longer duration. A porn, even an ugly porn, wouldn't hurt Dolf Lundgren's career in the way this movie has.
