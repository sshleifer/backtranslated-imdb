I saw Cabin by the Lake this afternoon in the United States. Considering that this film was made for TV it was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in to the air tonight and was extremely disappointed. I knew I wouldn't like the movie, but I didn't expect to be baffled by the use of DV (digital video). The film would have been tolerable had it not been for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot to be linked to these shots, but there seemed to be no logical explanation. (ATTENTION: THE FOLLOWING MAY BE A SPOILER !!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the ending open on the sequel is ridiculous. I can only predict that Return of the Cabin by the Lake will be able to see if the film was projected against nothing but the infomercials at 4 am.
