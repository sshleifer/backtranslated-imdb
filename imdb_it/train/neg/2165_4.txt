This film was a rather strange viewing experience. The film is obviously based on a game. Now I'm sure everything in this movie works well in a comedy, but in a movie it doesn't seem particularly interesting to watch. The film is too "stage" and they didn't even bother to change some of the dialog boxes to make it more suitable for a movie. Instead what is presented now is an almost literally redesign of a theatrical show, with exaggerated characters and scenic dialogues. Because of all this, the plot doesn't work and the film becomes an almost boring and obsolete viewing experience. <br /> <br /> It takes a little while to realize that this is a comedy Watching. At first you think it is a drama you are watching, with bizarre characters, but as the film progresses you will notice that the film is more like a tragicomedy, which goes much further towards the genre of comedy, rather than the dramatic genre. <br /> <br /> The characters and the dialogue are really the things that make this film an extravagant and exaggerated that sometimes becomes really unwatchable. Of course, the actors are fantastic; Peter O'Toole and Susannah York, among others, but do not really elevate the film to a "quite watchable" level. <br /> <br /> The story seems totally confused. Basically the story does not talk about anything and focuses mainly on the characters brother / sister played by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York. But what exactly is the story about? The film seems a useless and obsolete that has very little to offer. As I said before; I'm sure the story is beautiful and interesting to see on stage, but as a film it's not suitable and it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The editing is simply terrible and chronometric and it becomes badly laughable even in certain sequences. <br /> <br /> We expected more from director J. Lee Thompson, who obviously made films far better than this rather failed theatrical project translated to the screen. <br /> <br /> It really isn't worth it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
