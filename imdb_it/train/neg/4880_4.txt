After "Central City" lost the head of the mafia to kill, the socio-criminal Robert Armstrong (as "Doc" Rogers) decides to take drastic measures like Edward "Baby Face" Morgan), to manage the family business. The naive Mr. Cromwell is brought into the city and installed as president of his father's "Acme Protection Agency", a front for the gangsters. While Cromwell innocently sells insurance, his "employees" run an extortion racket. Cromwell falls for the beautiful client Mary Carlisle (like Virginia Clark); and, is the duo in great danger? "Baby Face Morgan" captures the star Cromwell and Mrs. Carlisle towards the end of their once "promising" cinematographic careers. It's a small, fast, light and harmless criminal drama. <br /> <br /> **** Baby Face Morgan (1942) Arthur Dreifuss ~ Richard Cromwell, Mary Carlisle, Robert Armstrong
