Vipul Shah has done a truly remarkable job as a director in the past. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were fun and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, he produced. His latest release as a film director 'London Dreams' is his weakest career. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' has a mediocre plot, talks about how success turns friendship into hatred. Okay, it has the potential but when you look at 'London Dreams' you wonder what's going on? This film has perhaps the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah down as a director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is horrendous. How can someone forgive a person who has decided to destroy you? I will not do that. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask his diaper friend for forgiveness, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, rather than slapping or insulting him, Salman welcomes him with the Baja band and says that was the reason behind the whole fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as GOD? If yes, then you have failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is this: would you like a person who destroyed you with such a great welcome? Write what you feel, do not deceive us {the audience}, we are sensitive enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical but the music of Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song remains in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is superb though. He carries the film on his shoulders and really does very well in emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a retarded at the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman completely overwrote it. Asin is wasted, and what does a great talent like Om Puri do in this movie? Rannvijay hams, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is fine as the vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream remains a dream!
