After watching the 10 minutes of this film I was baffled, after seeing the 30 minutes that my toes were curling - I simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really horrible. Indeed it is so terrible, that I had to observe everything to be convinced (!). During this, I realized that it reminded me of a lot of Danish comedies from the 60s and 70s. The scheme is as follows: take an extremely popular comedian, create a script that puts this comedian into as many grotesque situations as possible, add lots of jokes (especially one-liner) and livens up with a couple of pretty girls - movies that, and you a success! I don't know if this film was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with some great comedians) there seems to be a market for this type of film in the United States.
