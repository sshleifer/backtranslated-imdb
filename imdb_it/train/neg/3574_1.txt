I simply couldn't finish this movie. I tuned in after what I would say is my nomination for the most misguided attempt at sexual recognition: a scene in which Pia Zadora, on a picnic, stands between two guys who want her. One (the good boy) asks her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she would like a hot dog, which she then keeps for her. At horse level. I hope not to spoil anything to say that he turns around, and takes the hot dog, with a smile. Simply pathetic
