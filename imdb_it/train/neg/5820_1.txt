This film is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I am studying French in college so I understood all the dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I must say that it is really difficult to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the film. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I don't guess professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Even though I rated 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't deserve such a low score. This is simply a futile effort to lower his current overall rating by 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate assessment because the film is a true non-event of around 100 minutes in length that you will never return. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that I'm sure some college students are breaking his nut by making a film twice as good and half the length. However, if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to revolve around IMDb, you could also give a "10 in Lost in Translation".
