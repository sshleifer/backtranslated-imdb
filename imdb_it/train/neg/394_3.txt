I am rooting for films that fill the gaps in the film world. So, after seeing the trailer for "Water Lilies", I expected to appreciate this movie because I thought I had stumbled upon something unique: a film that honestly plays lesbian love for teenagers - a kind of female version of "Beautiful Thing ". <br /> <br /> The main characters are 15 year old French women. Marie is slim, reticent and pretty in a tomboy way; Floriane is extrovert, athletic and beautiful; and Anne is loyal, plump and basically immature. The erotic interrelation between Marie and Floriane is always latent in this film, if not on the surface, then just below. <br /> <br /> "Water Lilies", however, it is not the dawn of lesbian love on two teenagers; it is sexual frustration, suffering, boredom, adolescents who work for cross purposes and - in at least two cases - mechanical sex without joy. It also shows that screenwriters and filmmakers have their own creations when they become too manipulative. <br /> <br /> In the extra features of the DVD "The Lord of the Flies", director Peter Brook says: "French cynicism begins with the excitement of sex", meaning the French, consider children as angels as they consider adolescents and adults with pervasive cynicism. Part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker Celine Sciamma swallowed a powerful dose of this cynicism. <br /> <br /> "Where is the joy?" I wondered while watching this movie. Yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyous and triumphantly erotic in a new and life-affirming way. These positive aspects are missing in this film; there is no balance. <br /> <br /> Organically, this film wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. But Sciamma is too impressed by his cynicism and intelligence and ruins the film. First, what's the point of showing only the naked plump girl? I know that there is a consolidated tradition of tasteful adolescent nudity in European cinema, as films like "The slingshot, The rascals, The devil, Probably, The little thief, The murmur of the heart, Friends, Beau Pere" and "Europe, show" Europe "; but this instance is a small authorial intrusion - "You see, audience, I can make a film where I show only the unattractive naked person". No equally distributed nudity or nakedness would have been an honest choice. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in a club where Floriane and Marie dance. What follows is not just Floriane who cynically manipulates Marie; it is the filmmaker Sciamma who cynically manipulates his audience. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the greatest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty occurs when Floriane warns Marie that she is about to ask for something that is not "normal". Marie understandably asks, "Who cares to be normal?" Then Sciamma sounds fake with his audience and the frenetic moment of the film, because Floriane's request is a fake, derived and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question that the film, the character of Marie and the spectators who invested their time deserves. <br /> <br /> Here are also two moments that falsely clamor on the spectator's nerves: 1) Since when did the French - of all people - bathe wearing swimsuits and a turtle to boot? 2) Which teenager - of any nationality - would have thrown herself down on an apple core that was thrown in the trash to get a taste of the beloved's mouth? <br /> <br /> The three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, they can become excellent actors. Louise Blachere (Anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. Adele Haenel (Floriane) could become a protagonist, or a bomb, or both. Pauline Acquart (Marie) possesses an intensity and a magnetism that are unmistakable. In the future, he could interpret anything, from a crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress, to a reluctant politician who rides a dizzying rise. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Water Lilies" was very disappointing. An honest filmmaker will make an authentic film about two young women who fall in love! No - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged boy - but such young lesbian girls can have something quality they can look at and identify with. And yes, to fill a gap in world cinema.
