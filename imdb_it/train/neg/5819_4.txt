This is the story of a dysfunctional Jewish family. The parents have divorced and the mother stays back home in the east. His father, Murray Abromowitz, moved with his children to California, and moved around Beverly Hills so that his children could get the best education possible. <br /> <br /> Things get really fun when Murisa's niece Marisa Tomei comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The film is about the various family adventures complicated by the affluent neighborhood drug scene. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter is a woman who wants Murray to move in with her since she wants a partner. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno arrive towards the end. They play respectively to Murray's brother and sister-in-law; they are also Tomei's parents. In front of the children, Reiner lets slip by reminding Murray that he has paid his bills all the time. <br /> <br /> The film ends with a sour note as the embarrassed family moves away from the fantasy and runs away around Beverly Hills with their car. I imagine the film promotes independence and a good old self-esteem.
