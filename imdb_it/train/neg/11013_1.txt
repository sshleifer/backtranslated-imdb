I like bad movies, but this has NOTHING. Despite what the morons have said, it is NOT fun. I know underground comedies and movies, but it's so boring that the director / writer should NEVER be directed to re-direct anything except local cable access! To love movies and comedy is to despise this film. I could never understand how little fun and boring this job was. If you like this movie, you ARE such a simple chicken coop, there is NOTHING here. ZERO! If you need to compare underground films, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or Early John Waters. The film begins by defining satire and I challenge anyone to show me satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUN, you can say or do SOMETHING, but if it's NOT funny you're not satirical, you're not nervous, you're just pathetic and this movie isn't just fun. ZERO!
