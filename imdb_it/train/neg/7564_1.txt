The Wicker Man. I'm so angry that I can't write an appropriate comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> The plot was ridiculous, thinly bound, and completely - only lame. Nicolas Cage ... too bad for you! I assumed that, since you were in it, it would have been at least dignified. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> I felt like huge parts of the film had been left on the floor of the editing room, and even if it was complete, the film was simply extravagant and silly. <br /> <br /> In the end you have your mouth open, your mind confused and good taste offended. I've never heard so many people leave a theater on the day of the opening with so much hatred. People complained in small groups in the mall, four floors below the theater near the entrance. It's so ugly. <br /> <br /> I heard it compared to: Glitter, American werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry he wouldn't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
