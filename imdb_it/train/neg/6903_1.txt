Probably the worst New Zealand film ever made <br /> <br /> The Jokes They are not funny. Used by other films and simply trivial Acting is bad even if there is a big cast <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting and boring has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza like the acting was done 1,000 times before <br /> <br /> I watched it when it came to TV, but it was so boring that it could only take 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sucks <br /> <br /> Don't watch it, <br /> <br /> Look at the dried paint instead
