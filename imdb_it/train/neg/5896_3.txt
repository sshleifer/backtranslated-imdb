A missed call, another Asian horror based on mobile. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a mobile called "Pon". A missed call was just as boring as that. Maybe the phones aren't scary or something, but this move was boring and sad. No tension or thrill for me, and the final monster was disappointing, vulgar and not vulgar. The film dragged on a bit in different parts and seemed too long. He didn't hold my attention. It seems like phones are hard to scare, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine scary. And it is ridiculous to compare this with "The Ring", it seems that every Asian horror film is compared to it and so far I have not seen anyone who is up to it. To horror filmmakers - take the phone out of the ordinary like a horror device.
