The best thing I can say about this film is that it has a fast pace. He didn't fall flat. The best things are the supportive interpretations of the actor who plays Edward, the proud future Edward, the always wonderful Holland Taylor, and the actor who plays Taylor's husband. The actor who helps to criticize Messing's potential outfits in a youth scene brings a delicious and absurd quality to the process. Ok, it's all positive. <br /> <br /> Dermot Mulroney, whom I adore, is much more believable by expressing contempt for Messing than in any scene where he is trying to be either a professional or a supporter. As others have noted, it appears that he has no emotional investment in this venture unless he wraps it as quickly as possible. Messing, on the other hand, sincerely tries to bring the film and create the illusion of chemistry with Mulroney. She is adequate to do so, but she is simply not strong enough to pull off all this without help. Give him an "E" for the effort and a "C +" for success. Given Mulroney's indifference, the only thing that could have helped Messing would have been a brilliant chivalrous performance by Irons, by the actor who played his ex-boyfriend, Jeffrey. Instead, his performance is weak, kneeling, whining and unscrupulous. <br /> <br /> If I tried to analyze this further, obviously I would have paid more attention than most of the people involved. It is innocuous enough to pass the time if you have nothing else to do and less hateful (and less creative) than The Wedding Singer, but you are much better looking again at "My Best Friend's Wedding".
