This film really has no beginning or end. And it's really VERY incredible. Mary-K and Ashley should be interns working in a mailing room for an Italian fashion company. But, for some reason, they are housed in a 5-star hotel (conveniently located across the street from the Colosseum), and all the other interns they work with are just as abnormal modelers as they are. One thing I found obvious in this film is the way one of the twins does NOT end with the boy. I guess they tried to twist their usual plot a little. Good try.
