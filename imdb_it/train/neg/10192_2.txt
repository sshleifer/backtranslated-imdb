One of the Lamer wedding movies you'll see. He beats his time period too much so that it was not updated before he reached the theaters. Ethnic stereotypes are like a joke by Henny Youngman, except they are not funny at all here. Molly Ringwald, well, what else needs to be said. It gives a hint to nonsense, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, because "I just won't be" does it in this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles affectionately at her moxy rather than ringwalding his neck. He is also an exceptional cast, take a look at how heavy Ally Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
