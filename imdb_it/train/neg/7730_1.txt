Despite much style, flash and glitter, this French musical cannot speak. The songs are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is not interesting, as are the many characters. <br /> <br /> People break into the song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the cast wears fake wigs and hairpieces, and the sets seem hopelessly linked to the studio. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so it had a negative effect on me. Definitely a shame, to have such a talented cast in such a weak final effort. <br /> <br /> It goes to show, I suppose, where the followups (in this case, for the great classic, "Umbrellas") often go wrong. You can't resume it, just recreate it.
