When I ordered this from the Blockbuster website, I had no idea it would be so terrible. Who knows? Maybe I forgot to take the drugs for ADD that day. I know that from the moment the cast climbed back into their station wagon, wearing 70s-style wide collars, flared trousers and feathered hair, I knew that this gem out of place in the disco era was the glory for the dumpster . <br /> <br /> The first preaching of how bad things were was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at stake to devastate the universe, forcing the quality polyester and porn music on aspiring spectator. From the opening scene with the poorly made effects to the "monsters" of another world and then the house that jumps from the universe to the universe was painfully painful as watching a production of the elementary school of "The Vagina Monologues". <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the sure sign that was going to happen was when a small ship appeared. The "ship" was suspiciously composed of what looked like old video recordings and parts of video cameras and would have attacked anyone in his way. Of course, if I moved more slowly than the interstices hit by Bob Barker, but he had menacing armor in pencil and the ability to throw an eerie green glow that could stop the bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting the simple balsa wood in a now or two (with some assistance). <br /> <br /> Going forward ... As the strangeness and the bottom of the bell continue ... We have discovered that they are caught in a "Space Time Warp". How can we collect this little nugget of scientific information? Because the older male protagonist tells his son that, in a more or less formal way, he remembers how "you won the big game" with a cup of joe or a frozen bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was he a scientist? No, but he did know about horses and apparently intruded like an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theories. <br /> <br /> The recording I saw on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer seemed to have been shot from a theater screen with the VCR on a cell phone, apart from that, it was really, really, really bad. (There is not enough "really" to describe it, really). <br /> <br /> I know some out there love this movie and compare it with other cult classics. I've never seen this film in its original version, but even then I think I would have come to the same conclusion: bury this fast.
