Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say that he fixes on the past girl. Remember the day the relationship ended. The dream sequences lack only nebulous transitions. He fondly remembers their favorite songs and the places they went to. I'm not a consultant, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets a middle-aged lady (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his horror, starts to take an interest in him. Did I mention what the hell Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't even move his arms when he walks. It's just weird Also to make it short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old friend gal) and kill her ... err ... I mean compare it. It does. That was really scary. He believes her married, yet STILL flies halfway across the country to meet her. He is routing his home to make sure she is alone, before he "falls" on her. She has an awkward conversation with her that ends with her sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the film mainly because of the unintentional comic value. I'm still entertaining his wife with my impressions of Dave ... "I listened to another Dave & Mary song!"
