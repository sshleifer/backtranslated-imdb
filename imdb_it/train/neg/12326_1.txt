A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex ... but it's all tied to a stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> Easily one of the most disturbing sexual comedies ever. Does anyone know that this film is shedding light on child molestation? I suppose it's OK because he's a teenage boy - if we had one with a man who seduces a teenage girl there would (rightly) be scandalized. Sorry, but having done it to a boyfriend does not excuse him. He is still sick I realize that Brown was of age (he was 18 when he was created) but LOOKS 15. I find it simply disturbing that some people find him OK. <br /> <br /> Tracking acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful - but she can't act, Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I've ever seen) and constant nudity becomes boring and isn't even remotely erotic. <br /> <br /> I saw this a theater in 1981. I was 19 and with my 14-year-old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). He wanted to see it - I didn't, but I decided what the hell? We went in and actually bought tickets for three teenagers who were obviously under age. My cousin thought it was boring and the other three children left in half! Let me clarify: three ADOLESCENT BOYS have left a film with tons of female nudity! This should give you an idea of ​​how bad it is. I'm surprised this was ever released. A 1 all the way.
