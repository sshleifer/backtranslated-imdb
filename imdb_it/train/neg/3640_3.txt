I didn't have any basic knowledge of this film before buying it, but it sounded good and I wanted to see a Viking movie really stoned for a while ... alas, this movie was not what I was looking for. I had hoped for the best, but instead was given a boring Nordic soap opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minutes duration. The premise of the film is quite intriguing: it is a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so angry that he curses the warlord's son, named Barek, to death and rebirth as Berserker. This Barek boy is therefore forced to live mad, mad and violent forever. The film is shot with enough competence, with a rich cinematography and almost-good performances by the actors, but again I found myself bored and questioned when this dribble would be over. The filmmakers had the chance to do something rather fun and semi-unique, but they dropped the ball. Maybe it could have been improved with some low-cost exploitation tactics like free nudity and a lot of blood ... I mean, we're talking about "Berserker" here, right? The Vikings had to be BAD enough, with all the rape and looting, so should the Berserkers not be even more extreme? All in all, unless you're a fan of The Young and Restless (etc.) Or, indeed, you're a crazy Berserker who likes torture, I'll probably avoid this piece of celluloid.
