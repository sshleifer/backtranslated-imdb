In a word, this film was boring. Life and spark were missing. A big problem is with the two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever. It was boring, and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The images were interesting, but they didn't improve the scenes. If anything, the images tended to detach the public from what was happening on the screen. None of the action sequences seemed true and, therefore, the film could not create any drama or sense of danger. <br /> <br /> The film had potential, but needed a better script, better acting and better director. I kept thinking during the movie, you know, this movie would work if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical acclaims for this film. I think critics are praising the film because they * want * to appreciate it and they want it to succeed even if it fails on so many different levels.
