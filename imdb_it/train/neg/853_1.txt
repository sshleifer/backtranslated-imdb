Ok, honestly I don't see why everyone thinks it's so beautiful. It really isn't. There were two positive things that came out of this movie. 1. Jack's performance, he was very good, I can tip him for him. 2. Danny's performance, he was good. Not that he was stupid enough. And what was Stanley Kubrick thinking of drawing Shelly like Wendy? It was so bad. It looked the same every time it got scared. The problem with this film was the ending. I would have had more respect for Kubrick if I had concluded otherwise. And, the film was simply stupid. The problem with the film is that the book was much better. So you don't see the film reading the book and you will be much better. 3/10.
