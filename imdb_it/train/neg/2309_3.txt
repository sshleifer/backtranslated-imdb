I have a high tolerance for the strange, but frankly some films go far beyond, bizarre, to the point of hurting the brain. This is such a film. Trying to figure it out or explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs - it's incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very nice Japanese animation involving a cat. However, unexpectedly, tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things happen - I wonder if I'm missing something in the translation. However, even if it is so, because we need to be treated with images of a magic trick that involves the dismemberment of a woman with a clever clever, defecation, vomiting, lighting of animals, etc. This seemed really random and rather horrible. Strangely, and I don't know why, some see it as a work of genius. I simply don't understand.
