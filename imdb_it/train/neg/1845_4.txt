Losing control is another offer in the genre of the erotic thriller that could be considered the pulp fiction of the film world. Usually, they involve an indirect route towards murderous intent, interspersed with copious spoliations. This is not a complaint, especially when performed by the extraordinarily beautiful women who invariably inhabit this fictional world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) is suffering from a writer's block. Just by chance, (or is it so?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages with her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to divulge any information about himself, but Kim firmly refuses to stop the relationship. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) thinks he will do wonders for his book sales. As in most films of this type, the epilogue approaches the end but some things do not add up. I've seen enough of this type of film to think, no change there, so - but I like them. They are so demanding. <br /> <br /> Cast performance varies. Doug Jeffery brings the film as a psycho / sociopath that you don't want to go through. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince as the woman in danger. Clay Greenbush like the PI didn't convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, a note of caution on the DVD in question. Both the coverage and the status of the R-rated disk and execution time as 93 minutes but the execution time is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes seem truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is interrupted just as it begins. 4 stars.
