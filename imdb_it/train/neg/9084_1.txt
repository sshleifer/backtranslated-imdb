This was the worst movie I've ever seen! Molly (molly room) couldn't act AT ALL! he had no emotions it was all blah blah blah as if he were reading from a boring textbook. The smart boy and the guy who loves food (the names weren't worth being remembered) were so annoying that it drove me crazy. When ever we talked about something scientific or food. Mollys Dad did not show enough emotion for his missing daughter. The police officer and Mollys' father said the same thing four times. it was just awful. Everything has been repeated a lot. Beatrice should have made something bad happen to her because she was so bad. I just missed a moment of my life watching this movie!
