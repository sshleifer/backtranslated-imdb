Previously I was not aware of the fact that in the early 90s Devry University (or ITT Tech?) Added the film to its wonderful repertoire of technical degree programs. Well, this film must have been the product of the Valedictorian class. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the flip side. Don't waste your time with this movie. Terrible horrible. <br /> <br /> The director adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has had dreams about Boogeyman and her victim since the first movie. Over 50% of this film is in stock from the original film. The rest of the film is the main character who has bad dreams while his therapist drafts a narrator. These scenes are shot through a filter so dense that the characters shine. They would have made Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So to recap, terrible. Don't watch this movie.
