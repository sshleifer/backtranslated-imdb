The back cover of the DVD (missed this when it came out) greets Hitler - the Rise of Evil as "A Triumph" (The New York Post) and "Mesmerizing" (Newsweek). <br /> <br /> Well, no matter the Post, but in reality, whoever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art should be fired. <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start. Why try to paint the image of Hitler's evil with colors that didn't exist? He was evil, but now his character is portrayed in a way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love for animals, the delicate and subdued way he treated women) and so on. <br /> <br /> The actors are fine, so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned in their one-dimensional characters. A kind of curse here with Peter O 'Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed film (or in this case television production, to be precise). The first was obviously the legendary Galigula. <br /> <br /> The list of historically inaccurate scenes would suffice to fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here. <br /> <br /> This is OK if it's on telly and you have nothing else to do, but trust me - it's best left on the shelf of your local Virgin store.
