Having finally viewed this film in its entirety, I am completely disoriented by the worship it has received from both critics and online users. Is he the worst westerner ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But "the last great Western American", a phrase I have seen applied several times? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A film that tries to tell a story like this needs credible characters who speak a credible dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most banal and the clich√© I've ever seen. The film can be measured in groans per minute; as in, how often does an actor or actress be forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? There are so many examples of what distracts you. The cheese lines arrive in waves; predictable, not original and often. <br /> <br /> If bad dialogs don't bother you, then how about bad shootings? Few Westerners can show you shootings that are absolutely incredible as they desperately try to get you to take the action seriously. It's okay if there is a comic side to these shootings, as in Silverado, but in Tombstone the very punctual and very rigid choreography of the first weapons is just another reason to leave this movie out of the list of good Westerners. The final showdown somehow redeems the director on this score, but at that point I was so uninterested in the film that it was beyond saving. <br /> <br /> Apart from these defects, I can say that the images are sensational - the film is well shot and the settings all look fantastic. Acting is acceptable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. However, if you are looking for the last great Western American, do yourself a favor - go rent Unforgiven instead. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
