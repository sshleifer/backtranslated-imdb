Not only was he invariably boring to listen to, but he had no jokes. I swear, an Asian boy who tells me that Mom Mom's jokes would have been more fun than Leary's shit. (Well, maybe it's fun for a couple of minutes but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary said he stopped taking drugs during one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still high in something ; it was just a crackhead that gave mostly drug-related curses. One of his jokes was something like: "I wouldn't use crack, especially having the same name I have in my ass" - Oh man, how did you invent it ?! I swear the only guy who needs to close the f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank God I didn't have to see it live. This guy really sucks. <br /> <br /> If you have fun easily swearing and "jokes" where you can invent yourself, then waste your time with this junk.
