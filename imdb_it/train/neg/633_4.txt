The Good Earth follows the life of a slave and a poor peasant in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the main roles. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, like most of the main actors, that I can't stand listening to him as he speaks. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Hollywood failed to overcome their racist beliefs to launch Asians in the leading roles. Taking anglos and making them look like Chinese is like telling Anglos that puts shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans.
