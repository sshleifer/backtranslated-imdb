One of the worst films in which I saw the poor camera work, the poor use of the filter, the film was grainy, the script was terrible, I mean, how predictable is the great battle at the end ..... <br /> <br /> some fight scenes were in place I think .... <br /> <br /> some scenes were so bad that it was comical ... like Sorbo taking the horse and riding at the end ... I really mean ... a horse? Oh, I can't forget how bad killers run around on the same vehicle throughout the movie ... one would think that after killing key witnesses and federal agents, they would be tracked ... ETC, ETC really wouldn't bother looking at it ...
