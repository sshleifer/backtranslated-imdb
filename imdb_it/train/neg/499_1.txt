The Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic and soft gothic porn movies every night from 10 pm until 4 am, but their "scary" factor is very limited, if there is one. In fact, I'm sure I'll find a multimillion-dollar lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer. <br /> <br /> Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves a special mention because I feel, the undisputed minimum of a channel full of bass. I can't even begin to tell you how bad this movie is, but for the completion of the 10 minimum lines required by this site, I'll give it at least myself. <br /> <br /> First the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the film could also have been called "toothbrush" or "wallpaper" for everything that has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes ... at least they had wallpaper. <br /> <br /> There are no leeches for miles around and even worse there are no dances, not even one. I'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here. <br /> <br /> A more suitable title would have been, 'The horned Italian count brings five people to a scary castle and bores us for 90 minutes.' Yes that fits better. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible and dubbing is terrifying, and that guy who plays Seymour was almost wooden in his walk as he was in his character ... abysmal. <Br /> <br /> The only redeeming graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in which every single female character gets her kit. Bonus. <br /> <br /> Otherwise drive a great birth away from this. No vampires, no dances, no scenes of a brutal or creepy nature and nothing on the land of God. I'll never look at it again. <br /> <br /> No word of lie, this movie could make you move moving images for life.
