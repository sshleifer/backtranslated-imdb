Judging by some of the comments in IMDB, I was expecting an action movie - perhaps a dramatic or a stupid or a simple or moving one, but essentially an action movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever it was that I looked at, it certainly didn't look like a movie. The plot is simple and direct (even if the prologue tries to make it look complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. <br /> <br /> Now subtract the first one (they never appear in the movie). So let one of the assassins, the princess, become a thief on a vengeance journey. Add a rebellious love-love with a guilty conscience. And you have the ingredients. <br /> <br /> But they haven't managed to turn it into a story or a movie yet. Between some random action sequences and some strange images trying to be science fiction on a low budget, what you have left is a feeling of emptiness. The film does not look like a movie, but a strange dream, incoherent and boring. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
