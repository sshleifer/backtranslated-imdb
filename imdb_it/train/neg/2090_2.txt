I realize that it should not be BSG and I can handle slow-paced shows if they are interesting but I find myself completely uninterested and bored by this series. <br /> <br /> The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama <br /> <br /> Caprica's formula seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi <br /> <br /> Maybe it will become more interesting but starting with episode 3 I can barely look at it. In fact, it's at the bottom of my list to watch for the week. This is a sad state of affairs. The Syfi channel really destroyed their Friday night line-up. Whatever happened to the glory days of SG1, Stargate Atlantis and BSG on Friday night? They had a good thing there.
