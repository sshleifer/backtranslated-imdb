Now, I'm one to watch movies that have bad reviews and say "Hmm ... it's not so bad!" I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind, I didn't really start looking at it with high hopes, but I thought maybe ... just maybe ... it would have been bad in a way I could have laughed at it. I was wrong. At no time during my suffering through this "film" (and I use this term sparingly) I was even close to being moderately amused. To start, Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino similar to Marlon Brando when it comes to acting. I hate rap music, but as far as I can tell, an Amish priest would probably be a better rapper than he is. The main character is simply annoying, and not a character that is easy to love. Frankly, I'd rather eat an oily rag from a bloody fetus's bloody wounds than look at it again.
