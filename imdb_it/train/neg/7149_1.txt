Anyone who has written "Redline" as a great car movie must be repaid by Daniel Sadek to promote this fucking pile of amateur crap. Easily the worst automotive movie or any other movie ever made. This makes the Showgirls look like Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> Take every cheap clich√© of an action TV series of the 80s, stage some really bad special effects and crippled characters with no relevance and you have living proof that Daniel Sadek should not write scripts and produce films, but should remain in the real estate sector. <br /> <br /> This is a lame film with such a loathsome plot and the most invented action sequences of all time. What offends me is not that the creators of this film are idiots but consider the public film as an idiot enough to fall for this shit.
