Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm sometime after directing "Apocalypse Now" that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie? <br /> <br /> You wonder what the director of "The Godfather" and "The Conversation" thought when he made this flaccid film. He gives Kathleen Turner a vehicle as a protagonist, interpreting a woman who travels back in time and gets her adolescence knowing all the things that adult life has taught her, and Turner, the soldier he is, does what he can with but this film cannot be saved by anyone. <br /> <br /> He doesn't even have a style and, given his director, one would expect that even if he had nothing else, he would have this. <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
