Warning: this review contains minor spoilers. <br /> <br /> Well, the authors of the first Tremors are officially without ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie and the first two sequels are good enough for direct videos. Tremors 4: The Legends Begins, however, is a very boring film. Where the hell are the Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative lack of Graboid in the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series is a "character study". Unfortunately there is not an interesting character in the film except the character of Billy Drago who is given too few lines, too little to do and, in the end, too little time on the screen. What saved the 2nd and 3rd films was the presence of Michael Gross in the role of Burt Gummer. Whenever there was no action on the screen you could be sure that Burt Gummer would be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However in this film Gross plays Hiram Gummer a very poor and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the positive side when the Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this film) are on the screen, they look good but it's as good as it is. <br /> <br /> impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was listed in 101 minutes. Good enough to go straight to the video. But after seeing it I'm sure this movie lasts 15 minutes. There are long periods of dialogue that are boring and do not favor the plot. Was there a race to make this film? I think not, he would have had more time and should have been spent on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packaged for sale with .... Tremors !!! What luck I thought, pay for # 4 to get # 1 for free. Well, after seeing Tremors 4 I like to think I paid the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single penny for Tremors 4. For fans of the series it's better to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins also exists. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins evaluates a 3 out of 10.
