What a bad movie, bad !!! I can't believe all the hype that has been lavished on this pretentious amateur excuse for a real movie !! I left the theater before the end, stunned by how bad the direction and camera work of that movie were !! And read the adoring paeans who say that there is truth and reality in this film when all that is in reality is a shameless attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of reviewers and festivals being inexpensive and gaudy. <br /> <br /> At least this movie showed me once and for all that the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke and that showing it here is more a label than the bad movie than anything else. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. You will need your time! I know I did it.
