This is not a real review because I haven't seen much of the film. I stopped watching it. The film is very violent, with drug dealers and street punks, but that's not why I stopped watching. <br /> <br /> Here's the problem: I looked just enough to be presented to different characters, who weren't interesting. Everyone was a boring and contemptible psychopath, without engaging personality, who gave me nothing to look at . I wasn't even a bit intrigued by what they would do next or what might happen to them. <br /> <br /> If there was only one person of interest, and I don't mean a good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. See "State of Grace" to see what I mean. In that movie the character of Gary Oldman is a complete fool, but he is * very * interesting. Al Pacino maybe did a good job on Scarface, but his character didn't involve me.
