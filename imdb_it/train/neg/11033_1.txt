The latest version of Rumor is that Vh1 is starting to do casting for I Love New York 3 mid 2008. So does this mean that Budah or Tailor made a stop in New York or does this mean that New York has downloaded the winner? <br /> <br /> I know that Flavor of Love is coming to its third season, so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and an I love New York 3 ..... will there ever be a real winner ??? <br /> <br /> I have also heard some rumors that the case will be reported for the third season of I Love New York !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York will be presented especially on Flavor of Love 3. <br /> <br /> We hope this is not a spoiler for the finale of I Love New York 2 .... I am just saying the latest news.
