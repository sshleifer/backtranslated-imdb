As a fan of Notorious B.I.G., I couldn't wait to see this movie. I am unlucky to see that it is a terrible film. Jamal Woodward is not convincing or realistic enough to play Notorious B.I.G. Much of the story follows Notorious B.I.G.'s real son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as Notorious B.I.G. like a child. Unfortunately, it's not convincing enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke is just as unconvincing as Sean "Puffy" Combs. Simply put, nobody is convincing enough to play their roles here. The big problem with this is the real people who are playing. It was boring and did not provide any information about Notorious B.I.G. that fans and non-fans didn't know it already. I was particularly disappointed by Angela Bassett, a very good actress wasted here as Voletta Wallace. The snails and snails from the movie thought that Notorious B.I.G. fans will spend tons of money on it. I am unfortunate to say that it happened. It's not anywhere near a good movie. I was expecting so much, but unfortunately I didn't get anything I wanted. I think you should definitely skip this.
