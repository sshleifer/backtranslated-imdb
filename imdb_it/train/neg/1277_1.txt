This film still makes me want to think about it. This film was not only as bad as in the low-budget, badly acted, etc., Although it certainly was all this. The problem with this film is that it seemed to intentionally try to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is that this should be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely terrifying, but not in the way horror movies should be. I could see the first segment trying to be horror and fail, but what the hell is the second segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching a film by artistic students, which incredibly makes the segment less painful. It is an atrocity that this film is not very low at the bottom 100, so get your votes (1/10) in people !! I know some people have given these good reviews, but, well, they're lying in a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Trust me, it's impossible to appreciate this movie. The only advantage of this film is an incredible life extension effect: it seems to have watched this film for years after only the first half hour has passed.
