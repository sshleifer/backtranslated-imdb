I'm a big fan of the book and Orwell is definitely my favorite writer since I studied Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of curiosity, Burton is an actor that I really care about, so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I was thrown. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer on the DVD before and some fears started to settle down, especially with regards to the frankly terrible "Thematic Song", listening to the Eurythmics shouting mechanically "1984!" again and again at an electronic pace it is as ugly as it seems. <br /> <br /> Acting overall is quite good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing scene of Room 101. However, this is also the point at which the film is disappointed. The film spends too much time focusing on the love relationship between Winston and Julia, which frankly isn't what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc builds a man's beliefs and then shatters them all in the name of him that is made to love Big Brother. The film jumps on what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons who has come to terms with his position in life and in the world, and his re-education through O'Brien. <br /> <br /> The comment on IMDb at the time states that the movie sticks to the book is completely wrong. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, does not engage with the Goldstien Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial cases in which Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but is mentioned almost at the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confused. <br /> <br /> A terrible script, which some excellent actions cannot save. Michael Radford seems to have completely lost the point that Orwell was trying to make, and the soundtrack of electronics is frankly terrible.
