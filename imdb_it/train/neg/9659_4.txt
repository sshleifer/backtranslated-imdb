After watching this film I was genuinely disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the director - I was disappointed with this movie advertisement. <br /> <br /> The trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third way out" apart from surrender or death (Polish information was even misleading that they had the possibility to choose between artillery or the German guns, even the wrong title was translated as "misplaced battalion"). This tickled the right place and I bought the movie. <br /> <br /> The disappointment began when I realized that the third way is simply to sit and count the corpses, followed by sitting down and counting corpses ... Then I started thinking "hey, this story can't be so simple ... I bet this skilled officer will find a clever way to save what's left of his troops. " Well, he didn't, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. And I was too. <br /> <br /> The story was based on real events of the First World War, so the writers could not make much use of their imagination, but they even thought they had found this film really indisputable and even a little boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it's not the fault of actors, writers or directors - their marketers have raised my expectations above the level that this film could face.
