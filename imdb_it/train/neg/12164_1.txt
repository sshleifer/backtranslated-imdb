this movie is not good. The first almost sucked, but he had that unreal ending to make it worth seeing. This has nothing. There is zero fear, zero tension or suspense. This is not really a horror movie. don't show anything. There is nothing to talk about. This could almost be a TV set, except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence. Even acting is not very good. dialog.as for the surprise ending, surprise, there isn't one. I suppose it could have been worse, even though I don't see how. but again, it's less than 80 minutes, so I guess it's a good thing. even if it seemed a lot longer. apparently this is the cut version of the film. I found it at a very cheap price, but it wasn't worth it. If you want the more graphic full version, check out the edition of Anchor Bay. So, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1 / 10 from me. If you watch this movie, you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper. If you are a real fan, you may want to collect the collection of three Sleepaway Camp discs (with survival kits) from Anchor Bay containing the first three uncut films with special features
