It's not a hit on Korman because he was so much fun on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in the films of Mel Brooks ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). However, he is not a person who can bring a film in duel roles or less. This is basically a "Gremlins" knockoff, following a tradition of films like "Critters" and "Ghoulies". It's not even a good knockoff, on a par with "Ghoulies", but in a much lighter tone as it's not the darkest place in that movie. In fact, this is too light and frothy, and unfortunately many beats end up falling flat. Even if I gave a 3 for a score, this is just because there is a movie that is even a worse "Gremlin" knockout. If you've looked at Mystery Science Theater 3000 you know what I'm talking about ... the infamous "Hobgoblin". This has a guy who finds a little critter in some underground place (I saw this movie only once so long ago, so I don't remember everything clearly) and starts out friendly enough. However, this creature quickly becomes hostile and obviously they are generated more and this is the film. Most misses in the joke department, and it's also really boring to see Korman play the role of the bad brother. Better to skip this, but then you might want to check it only for kicks.
