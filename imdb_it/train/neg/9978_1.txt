My girlfriend and I were amazed at how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes we would have called it closed, but we were too curious to see if the film could redeem itself. It is not so. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the praise of this film. The script was really horrible and made by some of the worst recitations I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly bothered me about this movie was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between the lines. I understand that I use a pause to create a feeling of embarrassment (as in Happiness). This was not that kind of break - it was just bad direction. This film could actually be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the foreign market is the best for this film, because then the inner dialogue and bad acting would not be noticed as much. <br /> <br /> I like these types of small eccentric films (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing), but this has failed on so many levels that I consider it one of the worst movies I've seen in the last years.
