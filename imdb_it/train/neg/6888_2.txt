This film is ill-conceived, misinterpreted and misread. <br /> <br /> Jon Heder is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same routine as Dynamite Napolean. Haunted by himself and ignorant. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Diane Keaton plays the same manic, overly obsessed mother who worries too much and yet not enough about the lives of her children (see Why I Said So). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although I generally like her, plays an idol idiot in this film. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels is passable but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please skip this movie if you want to keep your soul.
