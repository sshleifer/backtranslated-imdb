I don't want to get passionate about The Pallbearer, it's not bad, but only very slow at times. As the film goes on, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer and I think he's good here. I'm not a big fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but I don't mind it sometimes and she's fine here. The Pallbearer is not a highly recommended film, but if you like leads then you might enjoy yourself.
