Before we start ... let me tell you that I fully believe in God. I believe in Heaven and hell. Kay, now that he's off the road, I just want to say what the hell they think these idiots are doing? The last time I checked a host does not discriminate, vomit rages full of hate on TV, or try to push their beliefs about every unfortunate soul that ventures into the channel. Apart from these, that crazy, idiot, conservative, bible-beating, Fred Phelps lover Pat Robertson does every day. I'm all for freedom of speech, but since this covers a guy who says more or less that if you venture from his ideal way of life you are immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many of SOOOO's problems. One day, in my class room, we had a replacement teacher, so we decided to watch some TV since the teaching didn't give us any work. And we (against the will of many of us) watched the Club of 700, and of course that idiot Pat was railed and railed on the Bible, and Simon said along the lines of "God says homosexuality is a sin" and actually I heard a child go "Hmm I guess he's right." WTF ??? Seriously, if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin, then they seriously need to take that host, isolate them and throw them from a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
