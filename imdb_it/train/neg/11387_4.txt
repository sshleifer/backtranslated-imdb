Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work and study. I've been there twice, and I've never heard anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists or something like that. There are "invisible police", but it is not * a Big Brother system. There are only enough cops so they are visible in everyday life, but they don't bother anyone without a good reason. <br /> <br /> The Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the young people it describes in the film essentially become its characters. The film's directors carefully cut the lines of the plot between the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a "character" dies, there is a real pathos. It is difficult to imagine, however, that the three young people are all members of Bloque Metro, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country. <br /> <br /> The Sierra is not an accurate representation of life in Colombia; there are, of course, things to be wary of as small crime, but when you consider that pickpocketing happens in "modern" cities like London, New York or Tokyo, Colombia doesn't look that different. Colombians eagerly await their chance to show the world that the country, once devastated by war, is prospering more than ever.
