After seeing the trailer for this film at the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The cast of all the stars was another message that probably this movie would have been good. But when I didn't go to see him in the first week of release, he disappeared by week 2, I was afraid something was a mistake. I patiently waited for the DVD release, then bought it at home for a pleasant evening view. The wait on the way home was much better than the movie. To begin with, the management is appalling. There are no thoughts at all and the director makes a part of it, so it can appear in the film. I wouldn't want to run out and give it to work in the future. Secondly, the main role is completely miscible like Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is normally a nice character like in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun, but in this he should be a proud hero who tries to portray slipping when he runs and has geek friends, but it doesn't seem fair. Female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani are not enough, but when they do none of the performances they are close to their best. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been done for him and it is his fiery temperament and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another that fills the trailer with scenes that are not seen in the film and that instead are present only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment, even if some of these scenes are rough, they capture important gaps in the story.
