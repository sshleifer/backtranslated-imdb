After finding the high score on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond this high rating, I intentionally avoided reading reviews. I wanted to go to the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my vote, you can see that I was disappointed. I liked the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also liked the way the hotelier tried to convince him to enter the hotel room. When Enslin entered the room, I was ready for something scary. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts credibly. He's out of his mind. I am encouraged and I think to myself, this will be good. The people who made this film understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But that's what happens after it was a big disappointment. The subtlety is quickly replaced by the predictable approach of the shotgun ... Just blow the audience with every scary Hollywood trick in the book and hope something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects that move around the room? Well, you can't complain about this. Blood that drips from the walls and sinks? Great. Ghosts who commit suicide? Good. Everything else? How about loud noises, tremors, fire, more tremors, messing up the room, more blood, etc. Etc. It's all right. And everything has been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered the public with all kinds of things in quick succession, and they won't be able to look away. <br /> <br /> Well, it didn't work for me. And do you know what else? When I go to see a horror movie in a theater, it is typical to hear different groups of girls in the audience screaming with fear in moments of fear. But this movie didn't have scary moments. The audience was silent and uninterested. I didn't feel cold on my spine. Anything. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people saying they're one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry I do not understand.
