Well, it's hard to add a comment after reading what's already here, but I feel like I have to say something. I wasn't exactly looking for a "splatterfest" as someone puts it or even "blood and guts / blood". I have a little respect for the relatives of the victims, even though I really felt that the director DIDN'T. - I am without a name, without a face or meaning. Just a ship for Dahmers' sexual antics. I saw this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'What makes a guy a serial killer?' in addition to asking me the peculiarities of Dahmer's story, of which I know very little. People here seem to think that the film should not cover the events of Dahmer's history. I.E. his story, what happened when he was captured, the consequences, etc. but IT IS IMPORTANT! See, I suppose if you are American, you WILL know all this. We don't all live in America. To tell this story of a man like him of course, REQUIRES that at least some of the real history and events be told / shown. This does not mean blood and courage, there are ways of showing horrible things in a film with intelligent implications or shooting without resorting to blood. Without even touching any of his actions (I found out more about him by reading user comments on this site!), The film looked like a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction, a VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unpleasant lack of ANY endeavor, this film is POOR . I would not advise anyone to waste the time needed to watch it. A precise 1 in 10 (for acting!)
