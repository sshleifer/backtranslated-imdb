This is the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. It's passed like an art film, but it's really a piece of junk. It's a quality that redeems the beautiful tango dance, but this can't compensate for the disgustingly obvious tribute to Sally Potter to herself. The plot of this film is non-existent, and I guarantee you will start laughing at the end. Especially where he starts singing. It is absolutely unreal.
