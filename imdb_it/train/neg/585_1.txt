The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've ever seen, almost perfect. A plot of Lady and the Tramp in two senses: rich girl / poor boy, and skill against bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original, but also a dishonest, ridiculous and overwhelmed mess, summarized as "Rambo meets the black stallion". Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young hero returns from an absence of 3 years, and suddenly he is Superman on horseback; in the original, a beautiful film, it was real and believable, but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I was barely disappointed with a film and sometimes it made me quite angry: it was almost a clich√©. Manipulation of the shameless public - do the leaders of the studies think that all that one has to do with a horse-loving public is to put beautiful horses in front of them, to make them happy? A mess of a movie.
