I can't understand why the filmmakers re-made the film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an exceptional actor and Baldwin is just an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. Even the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It's almost boring despite the fact that the making of the film in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the way Baldwin was imprisoned by Mexico. I think this is an error in the plot. <br /> <br /> So I think it was not necessary to do it again, or if they decided to redo a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
