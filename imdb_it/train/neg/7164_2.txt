This film is more deceptive than ever, using a suspicious-looking actor like Walken to play in this piece of trash made it look like he had nothing better to do than play a boring role like this! And the fact that the film should have been about a witch and you really don't see it until almost the end of the film, but in the meantime you have to sit and watch this boring movie while you do it, or try to get to the meaning of the point and you have to go all this trail of boring actors and actresses who think all the time about how you spent another movie and decided on this and how you just put the money in your pocket, making the whole point of time there useless. I'd rather watch cartoons for God's sake. Leave this alone, please!
