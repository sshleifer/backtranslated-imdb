I was hoping that this movie would be pleasantly fun, like other genres of its kind. However, he was lame and I didn't find myself laughing a lot. See it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rent to waste and need a movie to pass the time. But I don't recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple and straightforward, and it may have been fun, perhaps, if the script was better. Jason Lee can be fun, and he laughs a little here and there, but the film is flat. Just don't go see this. Direction is poor, but for what it is, directing is not so important. I guess its main disadvantage is that it's not very funny. See something else, don't waste your time here.
