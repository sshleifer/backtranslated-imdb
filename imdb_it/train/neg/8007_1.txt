Really, I really didn't expect this kind of film outside of America. How anyone can examine the subject of children who sexually abuse and turn it into a "thriller" is simply sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) walking around as a kind of Rambo child saver was ignorant and offensive to all sexually exploited children around the world. <br /> <br /> What is doubly depressing is that the wonder and the terrain -creating movie "Happiness" came out the year BEFORE this movie. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is admirable to read some of the comments of the most intelligent spectators out there. They were able to see the poor and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is a great movie show a lousy amount of ignorance and you need to look at "Happiness" to open your mind to the real horrors of pedophilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely to be abducted and sold into sexual slavery or harassed by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even relative? Hmm ... I wonder. If they make a film about international child slavery of any kind, they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally engaging instead of this button-pushing crap. 1/10
