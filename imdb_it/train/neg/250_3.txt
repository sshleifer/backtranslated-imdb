Having seen three other versions of the same film, I'm afraid this is by far the weakest, mainly due to Scott's rather boring and leaden performance. His emotions are so bland that it makes it difficult to engage in the film. Alistair Sim played the infinitely better role. When Scrooge was in his heart, there is no sense that Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis it is not as convincing. I can't think of any actor in this movie that matches those of the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) assume this is best performed. Very disappointing.
