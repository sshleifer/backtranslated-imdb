Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This film is a piece of shit from the beginning. It has a really stupid "plot", a really pathetic "acting" and so "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some "post-adolescents" in their thirties are trapped in the woods with a crazy, reptilian creature in a rubber suit that wanders incessantly. What you get with this movie is a lot of talk and a little valuable action. You have girls walking in the woods talking, and then you have guys (with a heavy mascara) walking in the woods talking. Everything is so boring! <br /> <br /> The creature itself is rarely seen during most of the film. When shown, the image is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a good movie in ANY word and those who praised it are most likely the ones who were picked up from the street to "act" in this truly amazing movie! Skip this for sure!
