"Meatball Machine" must be one of the most complex, ridiculous, horrible science fiction horror films I've ever encountered. It is about good versus evil and a history of education, with the aim of entertaining with a bloody, squalid and humorous context. This is why violence is not particularly gruesome and does not make you boil, but free bleeding and nakedness flows freely. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I've seen, if that's not enough it is also directed by an unpublished director named Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie has it all, it's bad !, A must for every b-movie movie !!! ... Simply: a fun and rare gem.
