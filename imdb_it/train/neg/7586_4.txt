Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly with the musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs deserve to be remembered and even that is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the release of this film that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it was a coincidence. The film was made in 1946 and published in 1948, so Mickey was 26 years old playing a teenager like Andy Hardy. He was simply too old for the seventeen year old who was influencing radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney has made four films for MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy a remake of A Crowd Roars by Robert Taylor, Love Laughs by Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them Rooney was playing a part for adults. Also in the Andy Hardy film, Mickey played an adult that Andy Hardy returned from World War II. Because he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's ugly casting makes summer vacations even worse because in the original Ah Wilderness the emphasis is on the character of the father played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Big One played the inebriated brother-in-law Uncle Sid played here by Frank Morgan and this is the main character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven intervenes for Judy Garland while Rooney and Marilyn Maxwell's sweet and lovely friend plays the show girl who gives Rooney an adult education. In the original comedy O'Neill took her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood of the Code, so all Marilyn does is make the young Rooney have fun. <br /> <br /> Many really talented people have had a hand in this one and do their best, but Summer Holiday vanishes rather quickly in a freezing autumn.
