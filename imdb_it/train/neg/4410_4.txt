Typical formula action film: a good cop gets caught in a bunch of Japanese cops and gangsters. <br /> <br /> The ok result has decent performance, some fleeting moments that induce snickers and some loyal action sequences - plus the chance to take a look at the beautiful Danielle Harris - who takes full advantage of her perpetual typecasting like a rebellious teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> ** on ****.
