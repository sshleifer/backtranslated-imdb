... and actually I gave a ZERO on my personal scale 1-10. I've been in movies since 1952 and I've seen over 1000 in the theater (I don't consider the films I see only on TV). This is the ONLY movie I ever voted for in ZERO. <br /> <br /> My wife and I brought our four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6 years old) and even the children thought it was terrible. In fact, it was my daughter (now 26) who warned me about this site (amazed that the film had an overall rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> Dinosaur animation seemed amateurish at the time (and even worse in retrospect), acting (especially from Sean Young) is atrocious and the plot is simply silly. <br /> <br />
