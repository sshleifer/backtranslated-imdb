I read post here about the Wonder Woman costume for this TV movie. It should be emphasized at the time the film was made, not wearing its traditional dress. The producers actually adhered to the WW concept of comic book writers for the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> As for the film itself, I agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when he appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age for enjoying a movie about a comic book hero. Yet I was so "absorbed" by the plot, I stopped watching it for three quarters in the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, I wasn't the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)
