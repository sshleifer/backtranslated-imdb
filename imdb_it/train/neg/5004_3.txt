Wow it is ironic since this film has been out for a while I think someone else has reviewed it a couple of days ago. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watched this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl, for the record. <br /> <br /> The film was ridiculous. The characters guided INSANE, they were SO Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This film has had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. He also had too many twists. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film that is worth seeing anyway, the scene: "Warm heart, cold gun" where Nick Stahl kills the hateful girl in the shower. (Well, actually they were all hateful.) But his acting in that scene was excellent. The expression on his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing but it's not worth seeing the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.
