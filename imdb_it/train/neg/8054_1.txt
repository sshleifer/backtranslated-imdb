Oh dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and bad ... Remember the shot of "The Natural", where lightning strikes the tree (leaving a bright log) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat ?? Well, the producers of this film used that same scene to set up a scene in which a tree branch hit the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they paid to use The Natural footage, or just hoped that no one who would watch the movie would pick it up? <br /> <br /> Then at the end where they were trying to escape into the truck. This over-action in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad film, a really bad film.
