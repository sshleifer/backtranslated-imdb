Every movie that has nude scenes by Karen Allen and I'm still so bored that I go out, that's a stinker! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris and makes friends with a deliciously handsome French man she's having sex with early on. Of course he's married, ("But, cheri, why should that be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash of cultures is (believe it or not) simply boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Maybe the movie improved a lot after I left; but he should have gotten VERY MUCH to make up for a rotten start. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this, run, don't walk, to the exit. Save your time and your energy. You will certainly save your money. It is a pity that the production company did not save his money.
