This film was not very funny, certainly NOT WHERE original or as good as A Christmas Story. The characters (except the younger ones) try to emulate the previous actors and fail. The hill neighbors come out of nowhere because they were not part of the first film. This really made me sick, it may have been good with the original cast, so maybe not new because the plot is so weak. Salta.
