This time we take a psychological toy manufacturer called "Joe Petto" (understood?) Which makes live, wicked toys that kill people. He goes after the family that has the misfortune of simply living in the same house where he and his son mutant robot "Pino" (again, got it?) Lived. <br /> <br /> Easily the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the last) in this semi-series, this and the previous look like soft core porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's a bit like a cheap hybrid of "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and bad movies. Presumably in 2000 they started making a sixth chapter of the series, but it was abandoned and never completed. We can only hope that it remains so ... <br /> <br /> 1/2 star on **** <br /> <br />
