This film is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first is Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or any other important detail required to portray a story. This 'movie' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his manly side and, the 'tough guy that he really is'. I completely wasted my time watching this movie. The best part should be the final title. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs and thrown them at the producers. Those who are sane have given Toby Keith the chance to act in a film, he is obviously on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, don't waste time watching this movie, it might be the only thing you regret.
