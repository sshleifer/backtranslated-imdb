It seems to me, like a recent graduate in a film school, that in these times when New Zealand cinema reaches new heights, the public seems to think that every New Zealand film is fantastic. Sione's Wedding proves that this is absolutely wrong. <br /> <br /> It's completely overrated and not funny, and far from the "hilarious" movie that other IMDb users have commented on. The only really funny thing I found in this movie was Derek, the aspiring black guy, but other than that the jokes were recycled shit that we had heard before. <br /> <br /> Being half decent Samoa, I wanted to see how the film would deal with Polynesian representation. He was a complete fool - I know it's a supposed comedy, but I didn't feel like the characters had something new to say about Polynesian identity, even though it was in an ironic way. I was very disappointed with the ending of the film and the resolution of the character's reports - Mikaele was the player who only played jokes on white women, he approaches slightly when the "Dusky Maiden" arrives in the city, he has an illumination that perhaps should start looking for a stable relationship, then at the last minute rejects him and accepts his position as a Playboy poliziana for Palagi's women. I didn't understand why they did it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see him waiting for a good laugh, but in the end he was really bitter about paying to see him at the cinema. The jokes are at the limit, the acting, in particular of Sefa's girlfriend, APPALLING, and honestly I would have been happy if I had got my hands on one of those pirated copies of the film to save me the ticket price of $ 15. /> <br /> I think the only good thing about the film is that it is the second step (behind # 2, of course, a film far superior to this) in the birth of Polynesian cinema. I hope Pacific filmmakers in the future can learn from Sione's wedding how NOT to reflect Polynesia and have something more meaningful and sensible to say. Even if it's done comically.
