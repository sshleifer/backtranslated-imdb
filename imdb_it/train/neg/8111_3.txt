Another great film by Costa-Gavras. It is a great presentation of the situation in Latin America and the involvement of the United States in Latin American politics. The facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the United States has been deeply involved in coups and support for Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the spirit of the film follows the typical left / communist propaganda of the cold war era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, he presents the actions of the United States as brutal and inhuman, while representing the extremist activities of Tupamaros as something positive. <br /> <br /> As it turned out it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States involved. Europe is full of poor prostitutes from Eastern Europe. I have never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls who prostitute themselves en masse as they do in most Eastern European countries. The United States was fighting a dirty war and God bless us that the whole monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is unfortunate that the United States has done what it has done in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you have to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world as Costa-Gavras and Matamoros love to believe. If Matamoros had taken power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All this film follows the sinister and corrupt ideology of the past and tries to pass it as an idealist and morally correct.
