I suppose many people comment / review their first film on IMDb because the film was spectacular or horrible - I'm writing because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was excited about the sequel to "Wargames" .. I thought the original was pretty good considering its time period and its content, I thought it was worth watching more than once . Being 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this movie. Computers, games, terror, excessive military zealousness have grown so much since the first film, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" has had the opportunity to bring everything into a great movie. <br /> <br /> The film failed at virtually every level, but I particularly blame writers and anyone who has had any input on the realism of the aspects of the game. "The Dead Code" was an airplane flight simulator from the 90s with some people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, Will Farmer makes a handful of keys with about 7,000 commands, none of which have an impact on what is happening on the screen. Until he "wins" by clicking on a box on the screen with the mouse releasing gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (none is close to the gas). Because he beat 5 LEVELS in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real vital war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Even if every 5-16 year old could complete the same task - The government believes that it is a lethal threat to humanity. They say things like "He has a thorough knowledge of bio-terrorism" ... He showed less knowledge than those who read the first 3 paragraphs of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror. Then follows a movie chase scene with about 0.01% of the budget and the excitement of any Bourne title. They have about 1000 opportunities to capture it and clarify the whole thing .. sometimes they are crazy that they barely miss it .. but other times they create masterfully opportunities simply by letting it intentionally follow it. <br /> <br /> Uh ... I'll write more .. but I've already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I'd rather see Broderick and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
