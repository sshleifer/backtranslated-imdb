The Polish reviewer must be a feminist because she believes "Young Catherine" is a fantastic and historically accurate film. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I took the exception with YC almost at every turn, and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the leader who with one hand moved Russia in a domain direction. The truth? She was taken to St. Petersburg only to be wife and mother and found that she had to "bond" with the Dvorians, the boyars and the army just to survive. Until he challenged them, he was able to satisfy his cultural desires (to fill the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that she was not "great", but in this area of ​​post-modern revisionism the demonstration is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit of madness by Ted Turner who, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is another example of how much Russia is portrayed in the West.
