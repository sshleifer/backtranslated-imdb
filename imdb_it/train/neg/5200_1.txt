This film is very, very, very poor. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was a little tension but not much to make you jump out of your seat. Start slowly with the construction of tension. Which is not a success At least if you ask me. Although in some moments or moments I have to say that it was a bit strange when people shot and how they fell. <br /> <br /> They should have created something like Scary Movie, so it could be a better movie. Because I only watched a few pieces of the movie skipping the scenes and the film became boring. I have to say that I felt sleepy while watching this movie, so I can definitely say that it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time even thinking about doing something with this movie besides leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
