All right, friends, a serious movie fan should watch all kinds of movies, bad and good, and this movie put me to the test. I will not deal with words. This film was bad. The story was ugly. The acting was very bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. In fact, I asked myself why did I take the trouble to see this ugly trash movie? Why did I waste time and money on something I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff so I can't avoid what should otherwise have been avoided. I won't waste your time explaining exactly what was wrong with this amateur film, except to say that the quality of the acting was, to put it politely, subpaar. A serious movie buff might want to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay at home, don't waste time, read a book, take some chores or make a good sandwich.
