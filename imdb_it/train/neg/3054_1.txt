The NSA, the CIA, the FBI, the FSB and all the other snoop agencies in the world should watch this film to get information on how to spy on people. (as commented by MST3k's comment ... "Sanata has dirt on everyone! Tentacles of Santa Claus extend far and wide! No hiding from the Klaus organization") <br /> <br /> From telescopes who can spy millions of ears on their ears that can hear everything. It is incredible that the CIA does not have Santa on the payroll. <br /> <br /> Satan's dance routine is exhilarating. Pitch ... it's so useless. <br /> <br /> The cheese factor of this film is tremendous. Budget very low but so fun to watch. I recommend looking at the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version for even more laughter. <br /> <br /> You also have a laugh at the misfortune of good guys. <br /> <br /> Give this a 1 for quality production and a 10 for pure cheese and fun factor.
