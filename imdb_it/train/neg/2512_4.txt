Tim Robbins is strangely benign here, played as a garage mechanic in the 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a lively blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although it is on screen most of the time, Robbins erases the inner workings of his intense person and fades into the background (it's easy to forget that it's even in the picture!). Big romantic comedy with a stunt, that of Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a fancifully conceived character). Otherwise, it is sugary and sunny, rather drowsily directed by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no intelligence or brain. Meg Ryan is her usual usually affable and the chemistry between her and Robbins is fascinating, like that of a loving sister and her older brother. ** from ****
