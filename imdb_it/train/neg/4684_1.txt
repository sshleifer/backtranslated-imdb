This film is an insult to ALL submariners. It was stupid. Looks like it was written by monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the vision that most people have of the Navy, then I cry for our defense. This film was terrible. I put it under "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" for submarine movies. Gene Hackman must have really needed the rent money to make this shit. Denzel Washington must have been tall. Little in the plot makes sense. And the ending. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you haven't figured it out yet, I didn't like it. And if it wasn't for all the professional comments, I wouldn't have bothered to post.
