This move was on TV last night. I imagine as a filling of time, because it sucked badly! The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and asses at the beginning and somewhere halfway. (Not bad tits and asses though). But the story is too ridiculous for words. The "wolf", if this is what can be called, is just shown completely except his teeth. When fully visible, you can clearly see that some interns work on CGI, because the wolf runs as if he were running on a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it has been waxed, all shiny :) <br /> <br /> The film is full of blood and blood, and you can easily identify who is going to be killed / cut / eaten later. Even if you like these splatter movies, you will be disappointed, they have not done a good job. <br /> <br /> Don't even get me started by the actors ... Very trivial lines and the girls scream at everything every 5 seconds. But then again, if someone asked me to do a bad acting just to give me some dollars, then hey, where do I sign up? <br /> <br /> Boring and ridiculous horror.
