This is the most basic type of traditional ghost story, not yet revived largely by the use of Irish places. If the great M.R. Had James ever invented such a subtle story - doesn't James have a story called "A Thin Ghost"? - he would not have bothered to have it published. <br /> <br /> Orson Welles appears in the clear endpieces as a favor to a couple of old friends, the producers of this film. His presence and the in-joke film industry would have earned this Oscar nomination. This is even more proof, if more were needed, that the Academy Awards have never had any guarantee of merit.
