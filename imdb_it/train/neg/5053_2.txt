I read another review that expressed the opinion that the platoon was an endless cycle of marines that killed people, were killed, drugged and junk. <br /> <br /> I disagree, because the film actually had more, but in a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this one didn't have a real storyline - which is a point on which I agree. <br /> <br /> It is self-indulgent stone at its best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how extremely traumatic it is for those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to have "glorified" this aspect and the grand finale is simply too much champagne, great success, hunting the Oscar "let's create a lasting image" for my taste. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his genre who cannot understand this simple concept: by painting the terribly bloody mortal waste that war is not TESTING OR EVEN REFLECTING ON IF it was an unjust war or immoral. We saw the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you miss the point, let me put it to you abruptly: if you saw how bloody the Second World War really was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If this fact alone does not convince you that it was an unjust war, then why the depictions of the horrors of Vietnam should convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that case. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not adhere to the theory "this war is wrong because people die and suffer". I don't think the reasons are always wrong by default, just because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> This says nothing about the fact that the final or big "breakthrough" was a bit stupid. However, this is not Stone's first strange departure. Wall street was a great film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a terrible "wrong turn". JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone actually did very well. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't really matter in this because there was very little plot up to that point in the film. And that's why I gave such a low grade. It was practically without history and, in the end, boring - unless you fell in love with the produced sweetness.
