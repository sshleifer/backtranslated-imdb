I myself am a big fan of low-budget horror films from the 1980s. This is not the worst, but not yet spectacular. The plot is decent but it drags on too long. You went through half the movie before you even saw any zombie action. The killings are not very creative and the zombies are not too clever. I really think this movie would have been better if they had left the zombies out and just turned into a mafia film. It is watchable but I feel that this film has stolen at least an hour of my life. I will give credit to the film for being a little original. If you really like horror movies B, it's worth seeing them, but if you're not, don't worry. But you don't have to believe me on the word.
