This film was written by Charlie Higson, who has already made the "legendary" Fast Show and his show based on one of the Fast Show characters (Tony the car sales man). He has also written James Bond books for children. <br /> <br /> Actually, I've only seen Gordon's films based on Lovecraft stories before, and each of them is wonderful. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally "contemporary", which means flickering camera, fast and strange cut, cool chillout music in the background. It works pretty well here, I guess, but it's still useless and cheap. I often think of the cameraman who is shaking his camera in front of the actors / actresses and tries to make style moves in the images (hoping that something tolerable comes out of it). The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good direction. I think the main character, the "zero" guy, is quite interesting in his "zeroness". The fat man is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but it's not him. But very soon after the start the film turns out to be something not very interesting: in this case I mean an endless series of sadism and illness scenes. There is not much humanity in this film / story: it is totally pessimistic, and every person in this film is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say, there is not even humor. It is a 1.40-long vomit with no relief at any time. However, Gordon remains for me one of the most interesting filmmakers who are active today, and I think of this film as an experiment, and a failure in this. Sometimes everyone has to experiment to get lost, just to learn and find their own way. This could be Gordon's most disinterested and empty job.
