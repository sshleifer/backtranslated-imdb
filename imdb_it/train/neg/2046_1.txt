I can't believe this movie was even shot on video, and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. The literaries have asked me for a refund. Take away the fact that the film has no historical truth, and it is still the worst movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B-rated movie. Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing the item and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved in this film should be taken away from the union, gives the industry a black mark, but after seeing most of this film I don't think anyone is involved in a union member.
