The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me. This must really be one of the worst movies, besides "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors and a really bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even if it's Halloween, normal people would have bigger reactions when they witness that their father is killed, not to say gutted, people with duct tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I could add) and a person dressed as Satan who drags dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could be so naive and stupid as to believe in the reality of the appearances of Satan and Jesus on the same day, as this boy does. When I was 8, I definitely had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to fall in love with this silent look of Satan, without asking questions. The question in the whole movie is, is it really Satan, or is it crazy to kill people whenever they feel like it? Well, he has human hands, arms, built and whatever, so I guess he should be in the movie, otherwise they did a terrible job hiding it. Then, with this person who is human and all the rest, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his lover, 5 (!! ???) policemen (all with weapons and training I assume) and a few others people. .... and of course everyone was just there waiting for him, or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen, and I would never recommend anyone to lose 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to see this total crap.
