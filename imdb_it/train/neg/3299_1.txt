This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Actually I was expecting a bad movie but I was taken by surprise to believe it or not. The plot is the traditional one, all the clich√©s are included. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is so badly written that you laugh when the actors, half descendants, are trying to make it real. The photo is not too beautiful, the music is so melancholy that it really made me angry, the actors don't even try, even if the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from people who have been acting for 30 years and the so-called action the scenes in reality they manage to lack "action" itself. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why these kinds of bad movies keep coming, who finances this shit? Where is the projection? And why the hell do actors engage in this impossible script? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even the aspiration to reach theaters, but even Straight To Video actually manages to look professional in comparison. <br /> <br /> I can't say anything positive about this except the title that explains it all, I feel robbed of 2 hours of my life.
