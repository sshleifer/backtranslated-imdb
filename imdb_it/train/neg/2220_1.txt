What the hell is in your minds? This movie sucks! Every minute I was getting more and more bored. I tried to watch the end because I hope at least something can finally happen! But instead of that, I was amazed at how the end was treated ... What is the story of this damn "bogeyman"? Why don't you die? He is a damn human being for God's sake! A simple boy who killed his stupid sister 15 years ago. So what? Has his stay in a psychiatric hospital made him immortal? This film is a fascinating fool ... It is a must of stupidity. I will sell it now to a foolish boy who will understand this stupid movie.
