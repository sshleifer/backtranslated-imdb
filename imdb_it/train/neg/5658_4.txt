"Laughing, Clown Laugh" published in 1928, sees the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito raised a foundling (a beautiful young Loretta Young) into adulthood and named her Simonetta. Tito raised the girl in the circus life, and became an accomplished dancer. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not overcome the fact that Tito, now very early in middle age, has his ass for the young Simonetta. Although she's not her biological father, she raised her as a daughter. This type of "ick" factor permeates the whole film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affection with a young and handsome 'Conte' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls in love with the young man, but feels guilty for Tito's abandonment (for loyalty, not for romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it incredible that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is (until he finally reveals it). The film is noteworthy only for Loretta Young, who would have had a great career. While I love the intelligence of Chaney as an actor, this whole film seems to me offensive and very disturbing.
