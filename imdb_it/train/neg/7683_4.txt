"The Cobweb" is an example of many examples of films that feature strong performances, sometimes noteworthy and highlights, but unfortunately they are destroyed and slowed down drastically by a dark plot and very little to interest the public. His protagonist is Richard Widmark as a doctor who works in a psychiatric institution whose life becomes in turmoil due to family problems and a rather ridiculous and overloaded conflict that does not seem at all a big problem. <br /> <br /> The plot is absurd. It's time for the institution to get new curtains for the library windows. An elderly woman wants to have her curtains on them, but many of the patients want to do it alone. And somehow, this ridiculous and unintentionally crazy conflict explodes at the point where lives are in danger and families begin to fall apart. It looks more like a conflict that would occur between very young children. <br /> <br /> The interrogation on the logic of the plot and the fact that it can really happen is so impressive that one wonders if only a really crazy fool could buy it. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with acting. The cast that follows Widmark is composed of other great actors, many of whom are nominated for an Oscar and winners. And occasionally there is a moment in the film that works brilliantly, but it always excludes the stupid texture of the window curtains. Unfortunately, there are too many things about doggie tents and so the film slows down. A lot of things to do are long and done from a camera point of view, adhering to the slow pace and lack of visual interest. <br /> <br /> In a brief analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized film and becomes obvious because viewers basically as soon as the plot is focused, which it does fairly quickly. It doesn't really seem like much fun to watch and I tell you it's not much fun to watch.
