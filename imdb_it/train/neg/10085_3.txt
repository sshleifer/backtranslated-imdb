Why do all Lifetime movies have titles that are so anemic? "An unexpected love" - ​​ooh, what a provocation !! "This much I know" would have been better. The film is nothing special. Real people don't really talk about how these characters do and the situations are really trite. The heterosexual woman who "turns" lesbians seems more macabre than the lesbian character. If you want to see two hot women kissing in a very discreet way, you could enjoy this. Although it appears to have been written by someone who does not really go out into the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?
