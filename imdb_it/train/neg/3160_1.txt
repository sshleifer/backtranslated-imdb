You know you're in trouble watching a play, when the only fun parts in it come from the cast of Animal. It is a pity, therefore, that the parrot, Cat & Dog was only in support and not the other way around, given that the humans in it were quite abysmal everywhere. <br /> <br /> If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what a name that is), Jason and Lindsay, I would forget this acting and do something else, since all of you are as much fun as watching the dry paint, and terrible actors to start. <br /> <br /> The main gag in the film is one of the characters who scream, I'm not gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you could change your mind if you had to put up with the three bullies, boring and I would say the very simple women lead into the film. <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years, and I hope I never see it that bad again, even if I don't expect it.
