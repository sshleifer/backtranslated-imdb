Is there anyone else tired of that old clich√© in which an almost dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us some information and then blows up his head for no apparent reason? I know they are. <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it's useless in this movie. If you saw the first movie (the first remake I should say), then the information provided is completely useless, because you would have known it already. I guess, you may not be useless to the main characters ... but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? Wouldn't want to live? Of course, he would have died anyway ... <br /> <br /> This is the second film which will be titled "The Hills Have Eyes II". The first is the sequel to the original film of the '70s. This is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me. See, I'm probably part of a minority of people my age who knew that in the beginning there was a HHE2, and much less an original HHE1. And now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is called exactly like the sequel to the original HHE1 ... it just makes it worse! But anyway .. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven's original Hills Have Eyes was decent. In the end, however, the idea was better than the presentation, but most likely had a low budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is not a good horror director. He only made some good horror films (Nightmare on Elm St., New Nightmare), some good ones (Scream) and a bunch of horrible ones (Cursed, Shocker, Vampire in Brooklyn). Oh yes, and he also did Swamp Thing ... but the original HHE2 falls into the latter category. I only saw a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he has co-written the new HHE2 ... and it is such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was even better than the original movie. He was tense. I imagine it has to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a bunch of naughty and crazy teenagers. It made us feel dirty. For the first time we were in hell and finally in the last few moments the good guys got their revenge on the bad guys and felt good .. <br /> <br /> This new film has no tension. No suspense. Only violent things that happen to mostly stupid people. There is almost no threatening presence here. Only ugly hobos hiding under rocks. <br /> <br /> I am getting tired of horror films where people die because of the stupid mistakes they continue to make. It was just the other day I was watching "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson kept walking around the water, while he was giving the speech, and then being eaten by a shark, just because the idiot had stayed close to the water .. something that no one would do in the given situation! Here's the exact same thing. People go off on their own to make a leak, even though they know people are dying ... seriously, couldn't you wait for a potty? And then when you think people would learn, someone else will go alone! Seriously, isn't it scarier when the characters are carrying their A-game and are still losing? I would think so ... <br /> <br /> Even under deliveries. It should have made the first remake look like the remake of "The Fog" (which was less threatening than an episode of "Becker"). More bad More time in caves. More tension More than anything. <br /> <br /> But it's actually a downgrade. Less bad guys. No tension. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but not much. In the end, it just seems like there are two or three villains. The last film made it look like a whole tribe of people. Where is this tribe? Who keeps watching them with binoculars? Seriously, these are the things that this film should have brought us, but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us, with the exact same "to watch" scene. Come on! I'll give the devil it's due. The appearance of the film is good .. but that's all. <br /> <br /> I don't even think gore enthusiasts will appreciate this ... although I'm probably wrong! There is gore (although most of it is accelerated while in the dark), but without the tension, and characters you care about ... the gore does nothing in my book! In the end, you're not scared. You are not shocked (unless you are an 8 year old girl). You don't even feel like you've seen something new.
