Hey, if you have a little over an hour to kill and find the paint to be too exciting, I'd suggest it. If you like cheap movies like me, it's a nice laugh! In addition to this I would not suggest you to rent it, I would wait for it to arrive on the tube, let's say at 4 am on the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. The band that made this soundtrack was on the road about two years after this movie, and they didn't seem so bad to live by the two reviews of small towns I could find on them. So once again it's fine if you find that the grass is having a lot of fun, but it's nice to look at it if you like to see how NOT to shoot a cheap movie.
