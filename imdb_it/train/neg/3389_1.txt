I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God knows how many times and I felt the passion, despair and joy coming from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he had to re-imagine "Chorus" for the screen, but he could never figure out how to do it. If the man who invented the show is perplexed, he should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. However, Richard Attenborough, fresh from the musical work of "Ghandi" and dancing with the animals in "Doctor Doolittle", ended up directing this film that had almost no resemblance to the theater show. Horrible songs have been added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs have been released or given to other characters (which made no sense). Michael Douglas was deceived. People who couldn't dance tried to act and there was the sexy woman "Landers" who couldn't sing, act or dance - I guess she had just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dances of Jeffrey Hornaday do not seem anything but schlock of "Flashdance" refuses and nothing works. I stood there amazed by how something so compelling and emotional could be emptied of nothing. If you really love this show and will be back on Broadway in 2006 - look but don't think that the long musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has anything to do with this movie.
