In the future of 1985, a government committee led by Howard Hesseman will hold hearings on the first uncensored TV network. They taste its programming, which plays like a series of skits. I can name the good "scripted" movies on one side, without using my thumb. "Amazon Women on the Moon", "Kentucky Fried Movie", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mr. Mike's World Video". Notice how I didn't mention "Tunnel Vision"? The reason is that this "film" is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are even remotely funny, or even less intelligent. It takes a sort of great ineptitude on the part of film producers not to make me even laugh. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dody Dorn goes full front
