Ok, I admit, it started very nice and good, but then it fell downhill, I can't believe that Sarah Michelle Gellar could have finished reading the script after about 5 minutes in the movie, the only reason I sat down to the whole movie film, I wanted to see the turning point at the ned, and to my surprise, well, people can't even tell you if there was one, because the end only leaves you confused, and then the role of credit, I was like the 'hell? this didn't deserve a run at the theater, I'm sorry, but I didn't want to say it was horrible, the only advice I gave a 4 is because it had some jumping parts ... that's all! you can watch it, I'm not telling you not to, hey you might like it or even love it! but if you hate him, don't say I didn't warn you!
