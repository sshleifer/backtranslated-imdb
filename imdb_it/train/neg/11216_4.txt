It's okay to film about a twin woman who has disturbing visions of her sister in danger at home. Then he returns home to discover that all is not well and that he will have to find out what happened to his sister and why. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing that almost works, but it doesn't do enough. I really can't understand why it didn't work, but it was good enough that I wished it was better, or at least got the right little things, like having girls playing twins in flashbacks be closer to size. I think maybe that's what's wrong, there are many little things that are simply wrong.
