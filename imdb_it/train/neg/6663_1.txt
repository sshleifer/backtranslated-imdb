I can't stand this show! Has there ever been a single saving quality, a funny joke, or a plot that "didn't" make the average spectator want to drown themselves in a bowl of soaked cereal? <br /> <br /> The voices. Oh, those horrible and miserable voices. Similar to repeatedly dragging a series of fine cutlery onto a dusty blackboard, each character is singularly annoying in his attitude to shrill and nasal singers. Cosmo looks like a plaintive bastard, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and Timmy's dad makes each line look like a bad imitation of a game presenter (I think of Guy Smiley from "Sesame Street"). <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible; even the producers of "Yu-Gi-Oh!" laugh at the overwhelming artwork of this show. Each character has teeth from teeth, or a square head, or a head three dimensions too large for his body. And what about having the characters that talk every single line with their eyes wide open and smiling, as if they were posing for a photo with the president? So, there's the fact that every character on the show is completely idiotic. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck of the fame of "Charles in Charge" have been portrayed as unrealistically stupid characters. Usually "unrealistic" is synonymous with "not funny", and this is certainly the case here. There was no such slapstick based on the absence of cluelessness from "The Naked Gun 33 1/3" ... and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the premise of the show (and it's the same for every single episode, so long ago the spoiler alert): Timmy wants something with his two "Fairly Oddparents", something goes wrong, there is always some invented reason why he cannot immediately cancel the course and remove the damage and then in the end everything will be fine. Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky and they keep hiring her at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a children's show that contains the subtle message that practically no good to say to a violent babysitter probably isn't a great idea. <br /> <br /> If you are writing an article and want to cite an example of how much the quality of cartoons has decreased, "The Fairly Odd Parents" must be a great starting point. A prime example of television producers bringing together a worthless product for children with little or no effort simply because they know someone will look at it somewhere.
