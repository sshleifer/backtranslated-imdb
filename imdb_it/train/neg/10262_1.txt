Now, I approached this thing just out of curiosity and I had to keep looking - in the same way you look at a car accident ... <br /> <br /> I appreciate the fact that it's a parody, but that it shouldn't stop from criticizing the director, the acting and the terrible dialogue. Seriously, this is considered one of the poorest movies I've seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that ... <br /> <br /> Okay - some criticism (1) when the doctor he had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we take a heart attack), the army then throws projectiles, rockets, bullets at the monster - which was the doctor's feet - the doctor still not it is touched by no missiles and it is still alive (2) the attack of the army from about 100 meters away, and we see a used flamethrower - geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 meters! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run to class and shoot on the ceiling; Does the monster drop the child, and the soldiers do not try to shoot the monster ??? Come on! (4) the monster looks like something out of the Power Rangers! (5) there is a scene in which the five "good boys" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the journalist and the child) all seem shocked and we receive reactions (along the lines of the hand to the mouth) one after the another - so natural! (6) the general runs away, from time to time (7) the general refuses to try electricity and does not want to listen (8) the acting is horrible (9) I mentioned the rubber suit monster ???? (10) that terrible music, without pause!
