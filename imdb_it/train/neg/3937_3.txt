It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best science fiction series of all time, to be at the top of glory. Nine years later it is almost forgotten, and his attempts to do it on the big screen have failed miserably. I can't even explain why, he's a loyal actor, but probably his moment of glory has thrown him into an eternal role from which he takes great talent. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Angelina Jolie was far less well known and she was really lucky that a movie like "Playing God" didn't bring her career to a dead end. Luckily for her, "The Bone Collector" and "Girl, Interrupted" were waiting around the corner, and when Lara Croft arrived, her career started. <br /> <br /> There's not much to say about this movie. Andy Wilson's only big screen movie, and there must be a reason. Everything is trivial and most of what happens on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar just to find himself working for the crowd. The voiceover is particularly negative, with a moralistic text that kills any nuance of cinematic experience from the film. You probably won't encounter the film but in DVD rental shops or on TV. Try to look for something better.
