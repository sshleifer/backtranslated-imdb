It starts very well, nice introduction and accumulates for the main characters but after about 5 minutes, the charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The character is in the same form as the main protagonist of American Pie and Loser without the supporting cast or innovative plot that made Pie films a commercial success. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest: Heder's acting was rather poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best, but they didn't have a substantial plot or script to get into the film. The film unfolds without any clear rhythm or logical plot that justifies its length. <br /> <br /> The ending is almost as predictable as they came - so predictable I ticked the spoiler box for this line. <br /> <br /> My advice: avoid at all costs unless you really have nothing else to do / listen to or watch and even then you will hear that the producers have just betrayed you in an hour and a half of your life.
