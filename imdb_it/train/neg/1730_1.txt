First of all I would like to point out that I know the show only because my younger sister is always watching it. I find it the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny in any of the "jokes" and the canned laughs are unbearable. The show would work much better if shot in front of a live audience. That way the laughs would show how "unpleasant" the show is. However, I give credit to the young cast's acting talents. It bothers me though that they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show connects well with the annoying voices and general style of CBBC presenters. Because today's youth needs to be screamed so much is beyond me. That's all.
