Sondra Locke sucks in this film, but in any case she was an atrocious 'actress'. Unfortunately, he drags everyone else (including then the real boyfriend of Clint Eastwood's life with her, but what did he think of Clint Eastwood when he agreed to act in this? A reading of the script should have told him that this was going to be a real snorer , it is an exceptionally weak story, in practice no story or plot of everything. Adding boredom, poor acting, even from normal Eastwood. There is absolutely no action except a couple of arguments and for me, this film is put on top of the pile of natural sleep enhancers.Wow! Could a movie be more boring? I think watching the dried paint or growing grass can be more fun. A real stinker. Don't worry about that.
