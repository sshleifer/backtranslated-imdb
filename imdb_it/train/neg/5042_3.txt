The main complaint with this film is the fact that I can't tell who is who. No racism understood, but these Asians all look the same! I can tell a little of the story, but how much it goes on. The identities of peoples are not a mystery, if they were a mystery I would be interested in them. Instead I wasn't off screen anytime soon. <br /> <br /> Tons of wide shots and silent faces without emotions occupy this film. Heck is boring, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there. <br /> <br /> The production is the typical Chinese John Woo, a terrible video with stained scenes. This seems only slightly better than Andy Lau's "Fulltime Killer" (which was a great movie). You will think that with a decent budget they could at least make the Hollywood look of the 90s. I didn't know the Chinese had these beatnik of art house.
