Words fail me. This film was extremely difficult to watch and in hindsight I really wish I hadn't done it. Even if I tried to sit down until the end of the credits, I must admit that I could not last more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this film would require the third most impressive final in the history of film production, so that it is given a review that is anything but vicious. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch any part of this movie.
