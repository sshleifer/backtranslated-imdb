This is the second British Rank film to adapt Sommerset Maugham stories to the film. Everything but a story from the "Quartet" does not travel well in the contemporary era; and the actors' discourse is definitely "clipped", as only the English actors of the 1950s can be. In any case, the "Trio" seems narrower and more filmic than the first film adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that these two films cannot overcome is that their original material was written 25-30 years before the films. As a result, in the 1950s the popularism of Maughm (before the war) "little morality" seemed rather bizarre, if not shy.
