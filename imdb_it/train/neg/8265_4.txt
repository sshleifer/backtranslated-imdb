It was catapulted from 13 to 30, with the magic powder in play, courtesy of 13-year-old Matt, but nothing is done about this if it weren't an unexplained device. New York City, in particular Central Park, but also every other part of the place incorporated in the film, seems full of hope and easily livable, and except for Lucy there is no villain in Jenna's adult life, and Lucy is also not represented how monstrous, just like an ugly thirteen-year-old grew 17 years more subtle. Chris, the one-time target of Jenna's aspiration, is now a pig driver, and you've seen enough movies to know that Matt will play an important role in Jenna's future. You don't really know what could prevent it before it's finally reached, even if I'm here to whisper in your ear, so to speak, that the device is not unique. In reality, it's not just a variation on the "Big" theme of Tom Hanks, although it's not even remotely fine, but it's also a strictly book version of this subset of the Cinderella story.
