A question for you: a family goes to a new home and is persecuted by the demonic forces. What movie am I talking about? Have you seen all the horror movies? Yes, it's true but it's not the answer I'm looking for. I will restrict it by saying that there are many scenes of adolescent anxiety. Doesn't help? Well, there are a lot of bits where the characters are chased by a creature and you see the characters through the creature's POV. No future forward? Okay, is there a dream sequence that involves a lot of blood? It could be any horror movie you say. Oh, I think this could take weeks, so I'll say that the movie I'm talking about is characterized by a lot of Australians, many of whom have appeared on NEIGHBORS and HOME AND AWAY. Yes, it is right that the film is THE THIRD CIRCLE (aka CUBBYHOUSE) and do you understand what the previous year is about? It is about me that I emphasize that THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolutely not different from any horror film that has been made
