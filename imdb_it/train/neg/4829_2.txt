As a normal movie watcher, I can't say I enjoyed watching this movie. It's not too exciting for a drama, not too exciting for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Moreover, some moments of the film are hardly credible. OK, I understand, the soldiers get a little crazy, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack theft in the middle of a hostile city, and after being shouted by a professor's wife running away, without have asked a question (correctly). It would seem terribly romantic if it was an animation or not, but it should be a SERIOUS movie about war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole image makes an impression that it's just a rough preview of a movie, and needs considerable work. <br /> <br /> It seems that the filmmakers wanted to create an image of a brave emotional soldier, but all these "curves" of his psychology seem simply unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture left me a question: why? Why did they give him an Oscar? Why SIX? AND IMHO is the most electrifying part of the film :)
