The script is so stupid that it hurts me to have wasted 2 hours of my life that I will never go back (where I've heard it before). The acting is so-so. Things change often enough to make you look and wait for something creepy to happen. However there is not a single original thing in this film. While the first Cube was a nerd horror film, which in the end didn't make much sense, the zero cube understood it and tries to tell exactly the same story, except that this time it's a hateful point to try a spoon to explain every detail that the first film did not respond. The comic thing is that the director recycles the exact scenes of the first film which were rather strange and tries to explain them. But the scenes are simply copied, there is no consistency. This script is so useless. I can imagine it was written by a 15-year-old with a baseball cap and a pack of beer for a class project. The best part is, in the end, paralyze the good boy prodigy, and becomes the retarded in the first film, and you see it when they find it ('this room is green ...') in Cube 1997. Goodie gooodie, clap your hands, what a twist. First of all, what to say if you haven't seen the first one, this makes no sense that you are the director of Nitro. Oh, another great idea: instead of numbers to identify the x, y, z coordinates of the room (cube 1997), this time are 3 letters, each of which provides one of the 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. Except now permutations no longer make sense ... so let the letters disappear before anyone can use them ... I want my money back. I guess I have to write this since there are only so many bad ideas, inconsistent or just stupid in this movie. Directors / writers should be required to possess a certain talent.
