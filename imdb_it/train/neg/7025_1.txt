I wish I could give this film a zero, or even less, because unfortunately that's what it deserves. I honestly never get out of a movie, but this was so terribly terrible that I couldn't stand another minute. Please, please, please humanity, skip this movie. If you want a hot lesbian movie that you can really delve into, that's not it. <br /> <br /> It has unattractive, unattractive leads, an unstable structure, a ridiculous dialogue, and is absolutely unconvincing in every way imaginable. On an absolutely basic level, it cannot entertain. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so swampy, it's WORSE than any student movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> What's more, the whole film is based on the constant voice (and I mean CONSTANT) above the narration. The screenwriter could also have written a novel, because they insisted on TELLING it all instead of EXAMINING it. We should just assume that Lou and Sassafras are best friends and have a special connection, even if there is no character development to illustrate this. Moreover, this film continues to present new characters after the first five minutes, and not in a natural way, but in a still image of the characters with their name written on the screen. There is no introduction, no development of any of the characters. We really don't know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman, who watched this movie with my roommate (another gay woman) and we both found this film as a depressing representation of queer cinema. I am beginning to think that lesbian and gay movies are very similar to Christian rock: no matter how atrocious it is, people will continue to crowd and defend it, no matter how poor the quality is. Please do not rent this !! Instead we encourage the production of QUALITY gay and lesbian films by hiring "But I am a Cheerleader" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures" instead of swallowing any senseless tripe aimed at the gay community (eg Queer as Folk).
