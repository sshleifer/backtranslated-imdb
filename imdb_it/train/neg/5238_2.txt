I don't understand the positive comments made about this film. It's cheap and ugly at all levels and I can't understand why it was made. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters abound - the foul-mouthed, alcoholic, Sue thief, Irish father is a prime example. None of the characters are in the least sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boy, but he too turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as both, I have no idea why Rita and / or Sue were going to run off like Bob - but since they do, why should I have to worry about what happens to them? So many reviews keep picking up on how "realistic" it is. If this is true, it is a sad reflection on society, but there is no reason to put it on the film. <br /> <br /> I didn't like the movie at all.
