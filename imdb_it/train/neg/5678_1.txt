This should be one of the worst, if not the worst, movies I've ever seen. (I couldn't watch it all the way). Simply and simply it is gratuitous violence only for the sake of it and the ridiculous plot does nothing but increase the dull and incompetent filming. Ill. It is only suitable for those who love manic mutilation. After killing several hundred men, women and children, Seed is finally captured after he effortlessly killed other policemen who finally get advice on his position. He is sentenced to death by an electric chair and miraculously survives! Buried alive, he digs his way and plots revenge against those who pushed him away and flipped the switch. Needless to say, more gruesome murders ensue ...
