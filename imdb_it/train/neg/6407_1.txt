I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. That is a mullet every 5 minutes. Seriously though, this film is living proof that the formula works. If it is not broken, fixin is not necessary. Streetwise vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-policeman martial arts master with a heart of gold and a serial killer with "problems". Pure magic.
