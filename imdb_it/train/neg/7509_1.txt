"Why?" <br /> <br /> That simple question had to be on the lips of every single New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. That same word will surely become the same puzzling question 22 summers later, when people come out of theaters exhibiting the trivial and exploitative "Summer of Sam". <br /> <br /> The director Spike Lee tries to weave the plot of a bunch of misleading hooligans in search of the famous psychopath - who paralyzed the city of New York for over a year - with a clear and graphic representation of the killings , the demons inside Berkowitz's head and the frustration of a useless New York manhunt. Presents a group of despicable losers who listen to their "barking dogs" as they live lives without love, honor and humanity - not unlike Berkowitz. Lee incites the public in almost every shot with "none of us is what it seems to be". Often a critic of the white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene in which Mira Sorvino, playing a bride with a cheating husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man "in the back of a big black Cadillac" . An Italian mobster tells a black detective that Willie Mays' famous center-field trap was "lucky". Lee also makes sure to deliver the racist reflections of a middle-aged black woman who says "I'm glad it's a white man who kills all these whites because if he were a black man who kills all these whites - there would be the greatest race riot in the history of New York. "<br /> <br /> In addition to an exceptional opening of a disco club (remember the shots of" Goodfellas "by Martin Scorcese or" The Third Man "by Orson Welles), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. Take the characters off the screen without human decency. Even if we learn nothing about the real victims of this horrible madness, Spike Lee seems to say that New York got what it deserved during that scary hot summer over twenty years ago. <br /> <br /> "How could someone disfigure? such devastation on his beloved city?" "How could anyone show such hatred of his fellow man?" <br /> <br /> Are these the appropriate questions for Berkowitz or Lee? <br /> <br /> You decide.
