I can't believe I really saw it, but I think I just wanted to know if this movie would become unintentionally more fun and fun towards the end. and so it was. the climax was the worst performance ever given by the defense lawyer - so from real life that even for a fantasy story it was all too strange. no way on this planet can behave in front of a court like you. and probably the worst prosecutor in the world. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove his guilt. a simple search of his house would have led to the discovery of the rings. but don't go. he preferred to say "objection" 2 or 3 times during the whole process - it was so. the blonde was given a drug to prove her innocence, but not Brett. the madman almost had a Brett altar in his house that could prove his sick obsession. but again no. during the court scene I felt the silent need to remove the tip of the needle from my hand and beat it several times against his head. even the real wacky do not look fake "I am innocent" like her. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown in jail, guilty or not. evil and wicked men.
