Yowza! If someone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good, you're a better person than me! This film, while a great attempt to "imitate" Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, is very short to honor them, or even be a film of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is torn apart by the old L + H films and planted in an unrealistic way, the plot is confused with the useless characterization of the other useless co-stars, Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did a great job with Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? The editing is unstable, the acting is rigid, the lines are horrid, the physics is unforgivable (even if maybe they were trying to give him that feeling of cheap sets?), And overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made his last film in the terrible writing and photography of the 1950s era. Do yourself a favor and see how many of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies you can, and learn how things are. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? Stan Laurel did not answer perpetually in semi-moral jokes with every sentence. <br /> <br /> Too bad for anyone who thinks that THIS is a respectable upgrade / honor for boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another nice casino? Why skip "any wiser"? Why was there a useless bunch of co-stars ?! WHY MISSES GULCH FROM OZ'S RIDER ???? WHY MUST BE LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO!? AND THE LEARNING CHANNEL helped finance it? <br /> <br /> I mean, really. Fart jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> FART JOKES.
