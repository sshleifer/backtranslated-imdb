Sogo Ishii can be a skilled director in the right conditions, but Gojoe tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival, a scion of the Genji clan. The making of the film has the main characteristics of a low-budget production, including blurry fighting scenes and clumsy montages (the kind that could be found in an underdeveloped dorama). The monk Benkei informs his spiritual master that his destiny is to defeat the mysterious spirit that guards the Gojoe bridge at night, but does not realize that this decision will directly bring him into conflict with almost every element of society at that time - but that could gain enlightenment. <br /> <br /> There is no absence of ambition, however, in his representation of the conflict between the saint and the mundane. Artsy thrives in some of the photographs and the editing helps offset the free film style. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
