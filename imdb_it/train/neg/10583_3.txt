I'm sorry to say, but the acting in this movie is horrible. The dialogue sounds like they were reading their lines for the first time ever. Maybe I got the "proof" version by mistake. The director overlooks the slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written and the fighting sequences are actually better than those I've seen in many action movies. The fights look pretty real. But all this happens while two main actors repeatedly miraculously survive incredible amounts of automatic weapons, grenade weapons, weaker blows and bazookas. Enemy soldiers are certainly some of the worst shots I've ever seen, especially when they have the truck running at about 30 meters, and every bazooka shot is at least 50 feet wide. Those bazookas need a serious calibration of the site.
