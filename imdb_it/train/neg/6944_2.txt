The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized - and given a chance for revenge when (after post-traumatic stress disorder therapy) he is put in a room with a tied man to a chair and said that this was the culprit. He is given a large table of instruments with which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, bats, torches, whatever you think someone might want to use to physically injure another human being. <br /> <br /> We do too many torture scenes before discovering that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime. The two then create an uncomfortable alliance; who put them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we don't really care ...
