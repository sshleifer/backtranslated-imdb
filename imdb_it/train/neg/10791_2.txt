Terrible movie If there is a Turkish movie that you should avoid seeing in 2006, it should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Apart from a couple of cheap laughs, this movie gets nothing, nada, zero, zero. Dialogue is economic and sexual cliches are everywhere. The director must watch other films before attempting to direct his own. Red-headed women show examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to act, this is a perfect example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the film is, wait, wait, there's nothing good I can say about it. I really must dislike writing about this a lot. Gee!
