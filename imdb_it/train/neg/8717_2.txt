This is one of the most hilarious movies I've ever had the privilege of seeing. <br /> <br /> I saw it on DVD with a group of friends on a Friday night and we couldn't stop laughing at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple: the terrorists hijack a convoy they think are carrying military-grade uranium, but in reality they are carrying a group of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy Mistake to Make Guess an incredibly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to face prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected the acting of 'Smell the part', as claimed by Joey in Friends. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of blood and a lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seems to have a problem with their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant heavy monsters. Furthermore, the lights always seem to flicker and come out whenever a Velociraptor attacks (presumably so as not to see how bad the creature's effects are). <br /> <br /> Having said that, we had a great deal of fun bets on who was going to get bitten later. <br /> <br /> Like a Jusassic Park / Aliens-style adventure, this movie smells worse than a dinosaur horse, but as ridiculous, ironic, entertainment is a resounding success.
