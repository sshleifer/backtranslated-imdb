Jerry spies Tom listening to a gruesome story on the radio and takes the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I did not find this particular episode so funny: the humor seemed rather limited and the whole set up was kinda lame (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this, tormenting poor Tom without a reason) particular). <br /> <br /> There are some occasional flashes of inspiration (like Tom's literally "heart in mouth" experience and the moment his negative lives are sucked out of his body), but on the whole , this effort does not have the frenetic rhythm, the excellent animation and the pure intelligence of most of the other cartoons of T & J.
