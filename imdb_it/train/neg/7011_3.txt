Unless you understand the miserable excess, this movie doesn't mean much to you. An attempt has been made to interpose some humanity in a cold and desolate period consumed by alcohol and drugs - it does not work. <br /> <br /> When Salma Hayak makes her great record, her voice is so blatantly nicknamed is pathetic - the producers could at least get someone who would sound like she did. <br /> <br /> The documentary that was broadcast on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history. <br /> <br /> No one except Mikey Myers could be accused of acting; however, it does an incredible job.
