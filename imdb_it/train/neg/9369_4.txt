Even though I heard that this movie was a bit dry, I watch whatever Scott Bakula is. At the beginning of this film I had high hopes for the classic fake but fun Scott-get-girl ending and up until 20 minutes before the end it was going great. The twist was crazy, unexpected and very intelligent. I kept my fingers crossed that it would work and it would have been a horrible misunderstanding until the credits rolled and I realized that there would be no happy and happy ending. Unfortunately I was disappointed to have seen it and to have made a qualitative leap to restore my confidence in the great Scott's goodness!
