I just saw this movie, and I have to say it was a big waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) absolutely cannot act. He read his lines very naturally and had a very natural facial expression throughout the whole movie. On the other hand, Rosanna Munter, who played Petra, is natural. He played his part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILER! The story was simple - we've seen it many, many times before. He breaks, finds another, becomes jealous, breaks up with the other girl and eventually they find themselves together. There were no surprises at all, it was known that Eva would leave and that Adam would "hook" Petra. The only thing no one has seen coming is that Petra told Adam to follow Eva to the party. She became serious, which is a side of Petra that viewers hadn't seen before in the movie, and told him to win Eva's heart, which was really cute. <br /> <br /> In addition to Rosanna Munter, there is not a single actor who gives a memorable performance. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film with mediocre actors, so I don't recommend it!
