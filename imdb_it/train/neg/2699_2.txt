I did not read a single comment by IMDb for this film that mentions the way the Jewish character in this movie jumped up and down like a small child, while a gun is pointed at the face by a racist skinhead while the protagonist's black protagonist he looked sternly down the barrel of a gun. <br /> <br /> I don't know how anyone can perceive it as a balanced account of university life. I agree that universities are not bastions of tolerance as they should be and the title would be appropriate if Singleton had not made his characters so caricatured. <br /> <br /> On the surface, try to portray the character of Ice Cube as a bad boy, causing Remy to become a racist skinhead. But who graduated at the end of the redemptive epilogue of the film? It seems that Singleton points to white as unable to empathize (I didn't say sympathy!) With his fellow black student or just able to take the path of a racist skinhead. Many people who have been bullied by people of another race do not turn to extreme fanaticism. <br /> <br /> Nor do women who have been raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is portrayed more as a cult than a lifestyle. Honestly enough, what was the point?
