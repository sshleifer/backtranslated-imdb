The championship game only lasts a couple of days, but things in New Orleans are not what they should be. From players with marital problems to drug overdoses to gambling problems to a killer on the loose, life is intruding into what should be a memorable and wonderful time. Can things be put back in order and a killer stopped before the big game was ruined? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about Superdome, this is not a football movie. In reality, football is nothing more than a plot device and an afterthought. Instead, Superdome is another one of those lousy soap opera films made since the 1970s populated by Hollywood and those that never will be. The cast sleepwalking his way through the thing without anyone really handsome. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role that seems generally lost on why he is there. The plot is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a successful "man"? Yeah, for sure! It is as credible as the relationship he has with the liquor imbued with David Jansen. Even the film has no rhythm. Trying to place all four or five storylines in the movie, zapping any Superdome stream you may have had. Without any drama or suspense in sight, Superdome ends up being a terrible example of a TV movie from the 70s. The highlight for me was the late voice work of the late Charlie Jones - a sports journalist I miss listening to. The eloquent way that overestimates the intrigue and over-hypes the atmosphere of New Orleans is pure cheese at its best. <br /> <br /> Like many others who saw Superdome, I did it also thanks to the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It could be one of the KTMA public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of the shows at the beginning . So, even if I voted Superdome for only 2/10, I will give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
