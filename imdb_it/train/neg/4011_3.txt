For every series that arrives on television, about a hundred ideas are formed, 50 screenplays are written, 15 pilots are made and one, only one, does it in production. From this selection process, we are led to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason so many ideas could be refused to give us a single television series. <br /> <br /> And so it goes with True Blood; all the stars were lined up and what started as a series of novels was turned into an idea, a script, a pilot and finally a series. Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a long journey and along the way there are many turns that eventually change what was good and pure and show that the producers believe that it would be better for the evaluations. Oh, how wrong they are so often ... <br /> <br /> True Blood is an example of a creative concept that has developed into one of the poorest plots, the worst acting and the most silent subplots of anything else in the history of recent television. Its international cast of relatively unknown actors struggle to find their voices, but continue to stumble over their fake southern accents. The not so secret desires of Alan Ball for Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a new nude every week even though it often has nothing to do with the plot. The characterization of Tara's angry woman fails to connect and you find yourself secretly hoping that the vampires will quickly take her away before she makes another speech about the white suppression while attending a ceremony for the Glorious Dead of Confedercy. Sam finds love suppressed for Sookie and suddenly we have to believe that he needs to watch over her in the morning, at noon and at night, despite the years of working with her and avoiding any such relationship. <br /> <br /> As for Bill the Vampire, his moral ground quickly surrenders at the first opportunity to make love with Sookie and has no problem making her a quick snack (although he remains somewhat unharmed). We find out that other vampires are not as popular as Bill but they really want to be accepted by an audience as they watch the living as Happy Meals with their legs. <br /> <br /> Despite my best efforts to suffer through the first six episodes, I came to the conclusion that no matter how long you watch a bad show, it's still bad. Something dies for a reason, even for vampires. Maybe this show should.
