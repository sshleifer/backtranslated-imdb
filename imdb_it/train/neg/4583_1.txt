If you want to see an intelligent and philosophical discussion of human possibilities and potential, look at "Waking Life", which is brilliant. "What the # $ *! Do We Know" is everywhere in its focal point, misdirected, poorly written, badly acted, completely devoid of any artistic direction and completely annoying. It was not stimulating or fun at all. The inclusion of this Rambling "Ramtha" in this film is a sufficient reason to avoid it. Isn't it strange how filmmakers choose to look beyond the fact that this woman loves a 2,000-year-old Atlantean god or something? What a staple that old chick and what a total waste of time and money in this movie. The people responsible for this film should not be able to make another film again.
