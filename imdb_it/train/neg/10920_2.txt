This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I must disagree with another commentator, who said that the special effects were in place. I found them rather ugly: it wasn't realistic and they were so fake that they only distracted from the true story. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this distraction is the reason why I did not fully understand the story. Archaeologists are looking for "the set". They don't bother to say which set, or what is so special about it. This also makes it unclear why they look for it in California, while the intro of the film takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert, make the effort to really go to the desert. The beginning - the ancient ceremony - seems to have been shot in a studio instead of a desert. <br /> <br /> The level of action was constant throughout the film, without ups and downs, without climax. It made the film look short, and this is certainly a professional for this particular film.
