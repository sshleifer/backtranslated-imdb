Okay, I remember seeing the first one, and the boy sucked. After watching it, I just laughed and said to myself, "oh boy, just another low budget B-movie. I'll never see part 2 of this". Then, about 1 1/2 years later, the second part arrived. He sucked even more. But, I just laughed again and said, "I'm never going to see part 3 of this". Then, about 1/2 a year later, the third part came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, I just took it after seeing it. God, I never realized how many movies could suck in these days. Just save $ 7.50 and don't rent the entire series. Trust me, it's worth every penny.
