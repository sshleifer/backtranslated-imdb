This film is just a pity. Orlando, Florida, seems to become a more recognized film area (like the rise of Vancouver in the limelight). The Brothers was shot in central Florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area (which has made great strides with the Indian film Walking Across Africa and the great HBO miniseries From Earth To The Moon) . <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. I think Orlando was the perfect place to shoot The Brothers. It had the potential to give a new twist to the "Boy Band" craze. After all, both N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys come from this area. But The Brothers is not up to par, probably due to a weak script. Both protagonists have no development (part of this could be the most amateur actor, but some are certainly the way the script was written). <br /> <br /> Another problem is the choice of jokes. Many of the jokes are too repetitive (they are fun the first time, but they get a little boring). Some scenes of the "concert" are badly on stage (and many of these scenes do not seem to move the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately a disappointing effort. I also hope the best for the next feature based on this short. But I think the best thing for director John Figg is to switch to different genres (quickly). Comedy is not his strong suit. But it is indisputable that he is certainly one of the most important filmmakers in the Orlando area (it's just a shame that he is famous, not famous at the moment). <br /> <br />
