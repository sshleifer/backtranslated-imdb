I was surprised when I saw this movie. I had heard it was the best movie in the novel. How disappointed I was. <br /> <br /> As any true Jane Austen fan can evaluate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The writers have decided to stick to pieces of ridiculous humor that are embarrassing at best, but also to ruin the feeling of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is a rather superficial heroine (but then any "hot" American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is mixed, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I couldn't really say a good thing about this movie. I seem to be among the few who don't value it, but if you want my advice, see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, it's much preferable to this superficial junk.
