Why has this repugnance for "Being There" ever been so loved? People say it's proof that an honest and honest man can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They are wrong. The film is proof that luck is everything: I hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not in Atari; I hope your shrimp boat is the only one at sea when a storm breaks; I hope you don't die of shock when you're luckily hit in the buttocks and not in the back; I hope you don't have AIDS from your wife. This film is also politically reactionary: all those who rebel against social conventions lose their legs, do drugs, beat up their girlfriends or die young. Furthermore, the placement of the product in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless. An emotionally manipulative film that is very, very empty.
