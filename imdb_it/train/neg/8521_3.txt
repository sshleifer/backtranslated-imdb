By the way, this gives away part of the plot. A Christmas Charlie Brown is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value of Christmas and simply enjoy the holiday. This, however, does not. Try to capture the emotion of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is also another Christmas game, but it fails with lackluster and easy jokes. Charlie Brown no longer questions the spirit of Christmas, but wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the film. Here is one of his jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but she doesn't know how to spell Charlie (for some reason she needs to be in her letter) so she decides instead to call him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. Also, Sally plays an angel in the game with one word a day: "Listen!" She says hockey stick (har har) instead. If Sally says to play 12 times (all strangely playing exactly the same way) it doesn't kill you, it won't do anything. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a great focal point, but this hardly makes it better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. He looks like a boy (who doesn't dispel the voices) and gets angry when he has to be the sheep in the drama (terrible baas and all the rest). She is apparently the sheep every year and is worried that she will forget her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried that she mentions him twice, one after the other, and gets the same answer. I suppose you should have a short-term memory loss, or something like that. Lucy and Linus are welcome (although Linus still has an annoying advice), but hardly amounts to much time on the air. I'm sure Schroeder isn't even in this. All in all, try to be a parasite of the original, but compromised the message by some quick laughter.
