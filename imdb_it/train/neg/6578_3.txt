A non-engaging, non-engaging hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it's not nearly as good as one of those min-classics of garbage. It's about the acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs) who is called to investigate an almost fatal drug overdose in an elegant upper-class university, but to keep it down. While digging deeper, he thinks it's much more than it seems at first sight. We follow Alicia, the girl who overdubbed even in flashbacks. At about 90 minutes, if this film had been accepted to begin with, it would have consumed him. This movie brings absolutely nothing back to the table. But it is the only film so far that has Miss Swain topless so the vote is higher only for that. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain gets topless (fix a "Happy Campers" error); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> anti-eye candy: more ass men than tit girls
