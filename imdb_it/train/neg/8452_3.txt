This is the first time I have commented on a film because I felt that if the right person read it, he could wake up and do something about it. In recent months, ABC Family has started broadcasting a new movie format. I saw the last three and appreciated them. They were engaging and did the trick. My wife likes these movies. I couldn't wait to see "See Jane Date". The trailers seemed big. Unfortunately, this is a film in which the book must be light years ahead of the effort shown by the writers and musicians involved in this project. The year is 2003, the source (all negative), the score was as interesting as a ride in an elevator in a department store. It was intrusive and did not add any emotional content to the film. It worked against it. I work in the film and television business. I like being entertained. This is a case where I kept thinking that it could get worse. The script had lines from another decade and I know these women can act but you wouldn't know from this movie. To add to the overall experience, the end let me shake my head. A tip for executives at Disney, ABC, ABC Family and producers: in any case, don't hire the composer or music supervisor to do any of your future films. They have lost their touch and need to understand what "contemporary", "present" and "current" mean when it comes to describing a romantic comedy. There is a world that is passing you by. All in all a huge disappointment from Von Zerneck-Sertner and ABC Family.
