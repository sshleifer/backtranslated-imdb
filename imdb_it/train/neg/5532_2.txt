The Revolt of the Zombies isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's rather at the bottom of the list. When an expedition is sent to Cambodia to find out the trick to create zombies after the First World War, one of the members decides to use the knowledge for his own bad ambitions. And he succeeds, at least at the beginning. A love triangle complicates the story of some. <br /> <br /> This was really a boring movie, with a horrible acting that made it difficult to figure out who the zombies were and who didn't. The dialogue was a little better and the plot was incredible (not the part of the zombies but parts related to "romance"). And even if I'm not a student or film expert, working with the camera doesn't seem to help the film much. <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen some movies that are worse, it's unlikely that anyone will. It's ugly, and NOT in such an ugly-so-good way.
