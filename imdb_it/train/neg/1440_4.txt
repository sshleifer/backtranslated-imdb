Swayze does not make Alan Quatermain very convincing. Compared to Stewart Granger; that growing up was my last hero in films like "Scaramouche" of 1952, "Prisoner of Zenda" of 1952 and "Mines of King Solomon" of 1950; Patrick Swayze completely fails. The portrait of an old Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was also very good on an otherwise big flop. Also Alison Doody doesn't have the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the protagonist, and, last but not least, the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa makes it very difficult for anyone to fill his (shoes) !!! For someone who has been disappointed by the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, I highly recommend it if you can't put your hand on the granger version.
