I watched the whole movie until the shameful ending, even though I felt so angry about what I saw. I felt that the director was screaming to get attention and the only way to do it was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I live in the UK, I have learned to love this country, but this film describes the young British people in the worst way imaginable. There is nothing to say but avoiding it will make you angry and sick. The people involved should be ashamed.
