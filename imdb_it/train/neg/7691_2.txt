Student Seduction finds Elizabeth Berkley from the other side of the desk Alumni Saved by the Bell and attracting the attention of the young and muscular Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can honestly say that no teacher, except one, has ever done anything for me back hormonally when I was a student. She was a Mrs. Diaz who was a middle school music teacher. Even as a young gay, I could see what he was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I could have somehow played by Elizabeth Berkley. <br /> <br /> Being Corey the celebrity, he is also used to having his way with women, whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces this belief. It's a forked chemistry that's what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA agrees with the tutor, but I don't believe it anymore. <br /> <br /> So when he tries to rape and he doesn't get an answer, it's harmful to his ego. When Berkley exits the channels and reports the crime to the police, the policemen who keep in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau do not believe here. Sevier's parents have the means to get good publicity about this for their boyfriend. Student Seduction, which is a misnomer of a title, if there is ever one in the garbage all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls, this TV movie was not an upward career move.
