The handsome cast can't lift this routine account of a secretary murdered by her married lover. There are actually more questions than answers in this one-sided story of romance and murder; and since only the prosecution is given to us, none of these questions will be answered. This is the kind of fare that appeals to the American clubs of "He Woman, Man Hater". As presented, it is the story of an innocent woman who is just "involved" in a love affair with a married and high profile lawyer. Is it possible that SE, she had not had two times for her boyfriend and had an affair with a married man, the whole ugly and sordid bad accident could have been avoided? When you look at this, don't worry about going to the 'fridge', you won't miss anything.
