This is a very confusing film. The film is very difficult to follow and the plot does not seem to make any sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when a film is nicknamed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as before. Perhaps this is part of the problem but I doubt it could explain all the problems with this film. The dubbing is pretty ugly and the voices don't match the characters very well. The scenes are moved, there is a series of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this film was the appearance of the same wolf and the scenes in which it attacks. Now, if they could put it all together and make sense, they could have something. Don't waste time with this.
