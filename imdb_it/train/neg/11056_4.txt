I was so disappointed in this movie. I don't know much about the real story, so I was eager to see him play a movie and educate me on a little slice of history. With such a powerful story and great actors, it seemed like an infallible combination. Well, somewhere the script failed them. Was it so scattered - does this movie talk about his childhood? his love life? its own disability? his ability to speak? his passion for the disabled? I'm sure there's a way to incorporate all these things into a good story, but this movie wasn't. I was left to look at cold characters that were unlikely not because of their disabilities, but because of their personalities. Other minor complaints: 1. The heavy-handed soundtrack. It's the 70s - WE GET IT ALREADY! 2. If he is such a phenomenal speaker, why have we not been treated more than a fragment here and there - and even in this case especially in montages?
