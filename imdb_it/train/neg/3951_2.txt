Ulli Lommel's 1980 movie, "The Boogey Man", is not a classic, but it is an above-average low budget cooler that is worth a look. The 1983 "Boogey Man II" sequel is ultimately a waste of time, but at least it's fun if not taken into consideration. Now I left the door open for another sequel, and I wouldn't be sorry to see at least one more first. One day while I was browsing through videos in a mall store I came across a movie called "Return of the Boogey Man". When I found out it was a sequel to the previous films I was happy to pay some money for this ... I should have known better. Although the opening title is 'Boogey Man 3', this is not the sequel to those two far superior films I mentioned above. Well, not entirely anyway. <br /> <br /> Pro: Ha! This is a laugh. Is there something good about this piece of cow dung? Let's see ... he shoots "The Boogey Man" and, um ... it's mercifully short. Yes, that's all. <br /> <br /> Cons: where to start? Decisions decisions. First of all, this movie is really boring. Switch from one scene to another without anything interesting or scary happening. Acting is at best rigid. The "actors" are probably friends of the director who have never experienced acting, and probably none since. The plot is non-existent and the script is poorly written. The management is just awful. The director tries to make the film look completely artistic by making the camera move, the lights flicker and with filters, but it doesn't add anything. Music is boring and difficult to hear in some parts. The links with the original are messed up. Suzanna Love's character was called Lacey, not Natalie! And the events represented at the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Furthermore, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to the series or genre. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. One thing is that if it was an original film that was the first and the sucked of the director. But instead it should be a movie sequel that is not a masterpiece, but it's damn more interesting and fun than this. If ever there is another sequel, which I doubt, then he must forget that this has ever happened and be run by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of ​​how to make a decent horror movie. <br /> <br /> My vote: 1/5
