Unknown to Richard C. Sarafian, this disaster stole Japanese theaters before arriving in the United States and immediately went to the video, where it was no longer seen until the Turner networks needed something different from infomercials to fill their time bands from 3:00 to 6:00. ribbon at the bottom of their basket. The name Smithee should be used when the studio affects the film so badly that the director no longer wants his name to be linked to it. But I fear that Sarafian cannot entirely blame the study on this. The actors, mostly recent graduates of "Overacting 101", deliver one line of cornballs after another. The plot is twisted. The special effects are insignificant. The parts that are not ridiculous are simply boring. The script or the book must have been good - why else would Palance, Matheson, Boyle or Heston agree to appear in this dud? But something went terribly wrong from the page on the screen. Summary: avoid. Not bad enough to be so-bad-is-good.
