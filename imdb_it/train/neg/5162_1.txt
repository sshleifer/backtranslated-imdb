This film reminded me so much of "A History of Violence" that it pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior, but that in the end it was simply an economic action film disguised as a thought film about violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from local drunks who do nothing but hang around the pub all day and cause problems. Don't these men have a job? In any case, Dustin takes all he can get and at the end of the film he keeps at home and fights each of the drunks with macabre means like boiling whiskey poured over someone, his feet are blasted by a gun and someone's head is trapped a bear trap. It's funny that someone needs a big bear trap in a small British town, except maybe he puts a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah who created the "Wild Bouquet" which also covered the theme of blood that leaves violence in which no one was spared. But it was done in style and you believed it. Straw Dogs is not credible. First of all, the position is wrong and does not work. Why put it in England? I would think maybe somewhere in the city or in a small town in the southern United States in the 1930s or something like that. Second, in my opinion it has never been clearly explained why these men are so ready for violence, except maybe they got drunk and felt the need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. Sam Peckinpah missed this target.
