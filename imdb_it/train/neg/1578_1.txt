Imagine, it is, for example, 12-1: at home, bored, you are not tired. This scenario occurred about 4 years ago. I turned on the TV and ran some channels and discovered that this movie was on. OH MY WORD this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A fleeing car that can't be stopped (because the brakes have been cut or something like that) in cutting it on the highway - what's going to happen ?! The film was so bad that it's actually funny - I think the stunts cost about $ 2 to do, there was a case where a child / small child was lifted from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a convenient location the bridge is approaching ... THIS IS THE BEST BIT OF A FILM EVER - shows that the child misses the bridge a little but looks so bad - you can almost see the brand of the manikin they used - classic classic low budget! I don't remember the end of the film though, but I bet it was GREAT <br />. I doubt they will ever show this movie again so I'm glad I saw this piece of junk!
