With one of my favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest with the remote control in my hand, so the fast forward was ready. So banal, so standard, you know what will happen in every scene. You can even envisage the dialogue word for word. This is one of those films that peeps a zero and says, "Why did this movie come true?" In an attempt to say something positive, I will add that there are some slightly funny special effects. But, overall, if you've seen 5 sci-fi movies, or are over 9, do yourself a favor and skip this.
