The film has several narrative lines that follow different characters. The different narrative lines do not feel like a whole complete piece that makes this comedy very inconsistent and even becomes annoying to watch sometimes. <br /> <br /> It may seem weak and clich√© but it is true; You're much better at watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more fun than this movie. I'm sure that both the cast and the crew had a lot of fun making this film, but the film doesn't give the viewers much pleasure. For a comedy it just isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin are not just good actors, even when they play alone! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie run, and their scene is long, distracted and useless and even boring at times. <br /> <br /> The film had some potential, I mean Steve Irwin is a character who in a strange way is both intriguing and fun to watch, so when I first heard that they were shooting a movie on "the crocodile hunter", my first reaction was; brilliant! However, the film suffers heavily from its weak history and lines of inconsistent stories with uninteresting and unpleasant characters. The film has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie viewable at least once, but still, I should certainly not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie seemed a waste of time. Even this film could only be watched once, when it arrives on TV, on a rainy afternoon. It has some good moments but the lines of the story completely ruin the film and its potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
