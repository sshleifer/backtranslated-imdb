AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out his best scenes. In the scenes she's in, she's just a zombie. It is involved in a sub-plot that is similar to a sub-plot in "Get Carter", but better handles the sub-plot in "Get Carter". (I blame the director) The director's tribute to Hitchcock was trivial. (It's the scene where the character of Ryan Philippe realizes that he might not be able to trust the character of Tim Robbin, at least I think it's a tribute to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the scenes that have been cut. I think that the director should trust his instinct and not listen to the test audience.
