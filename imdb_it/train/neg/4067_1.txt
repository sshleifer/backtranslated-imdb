Am I wrong, or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original? I have to ask you why the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad acting, bad tinkering etc ... the only aspect of "exploitation" here is how we were robbed for our money buying this piece of shit. It is nothing more than a light porn movie ... no gore, no scary images, just a little cheap trash. If someone wants to see an excellent movie with no name actors, a little slimy and a decent storyline ... get Baby Blood ... even with a low budget but well done ... and also a true story! Spit was a waste of money but I'll keep it for a laugh .... it's pathetic! New comment .... September 3rd ..... I will keep this film forever just because it's SOOOOO bad it's almost good .... in a really bad way .... the worst ever acting ... a real classic of the shit movie!
