The character's acting is a bit stiff, as if it were the first time an actor man appeared on the screen. Unfortunately one of the best actresses, Jean Simmons (she played many roles on TV, as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night), dies quickly and from then on her acting can be decidedly missed. <br /> <br /> The main role is Mr. Ballard, played by Cliff Robertson. Cliff is forced to wear this film with his body language most of the time. It doesn't do a poor job, but it's a bit too much to ask an actor to connect the oceans of the blank screen time during which the characters spend their time do NOT talk and NOT act. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man films (with Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable. A husband kills his rich wife for his money. from then on his wife seems to come back and torment her husband making him go crazy until he jumps from a high window (fearing the specter of his dead wife approaching him) the day on which he is expected to die less. <br /> <br /> The second driver that Mr. Ballard hires looks a lot like an English Hamill brand. Unbelievable! The only thing that emerges is the absolute lack of respect for dialogue. Many minutes pass in the quiet, nobody talks and a few recite. It's a shame that the MST3K guys have never taken this movie. It could have been much better, if not as predictable, with more dialogues, or scenes shorter than "nothing". <br /> <br /> I kept expecting G'Mork's red eyes to appear from the shadows and proclaim that he works for the "nothing" that lives in this movie.
