I read John Everingham's story years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking what movie he would do. And it probably would have been if Michael Landon had never laid his hands on it. For me, Landon was one of the worst actors in the world, and his artistic license went far beyond the lines, as evidenced by his massacre of the book series "Little House". Acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the script is sloppy, and there are other close-ups of Landon's devil that should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This film reflects the story of Everingham as much as "Little House On The Prairie" reflects the books was "based" on. It's just another vehicle to show off Landons' hideous hair.
