This film reminds me of some really bad science fiction movies from the 50s and 60s. It's not scary or interesting, but it's boring, shoddy and stupid. The special effects are ridiculous, all the actors are ridiculous and the ending is simply terrible. waste your money, rent or buy something better. I give them 3.5 out of 10 (I found this turkey quite funny because of its stupidity).
