This is the worst piece of shit I've seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The plot is simply stupid, the dialogues make no sense, the humorous scenes have never heard of true humor. Actors don't play, worse they don't even try. The screenplay itself is somehow part of the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing about this film, the fights. They are well choreographed as you'd expect from the guys in Hong Kong, and they're the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun. Although I believe the fights just need to fill the empty space so the writer doesn't have to worry about thinking about the plot . However, this weak and absurd plot could prevent you from looking at it until the end. Avoid it unless you are a fan of Mrs. Cynthia Rothrock.
