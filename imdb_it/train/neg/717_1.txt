It had to be a parody of the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most terrible movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad stuff. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I have no doubt that there are people who will like this sense of "humor", but there have been better parodies on films by acclaimed directors like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I'm working in a cinema and in the DVD Shop and the success of this film was similar in both areas: In the cinema it was a pleasant (but not so great) success during the first two weeks, but then, when the reviews of those that they saw were not too good, the film fell very quickly. In DVD sales it went well for a short time, but then nobody asked. In the last ten years, the two worst films I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which was worse, but I'm glad there are so many good films, so I don't have to think too much about this question.
