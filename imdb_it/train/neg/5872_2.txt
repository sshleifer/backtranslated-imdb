I saw it for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were two cops. They are but Busey is in the opening scene so he doesn't show up until 40 minutes into the movie. Although every scene in which it is found is fantastic. Especially when disguised as a blind hobo. <br /> <br /> What is incredible in this film is the plot. In the film, Fred Williamson is trying to find out who is stalking and killing telephone sex workers. At some point I think it's his Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partially right. Busey is not the killer, but is calling and harassing women on the phone. Why? I do not know. In no way is it related to the killer, it does so only for kicks I believe.
