The first clue that this is a poor movie is that it was shot on video, not on film. The plot is complicated and the production is incredibly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the title pair is on a plane that is supposedly landing in Vermont, where they went to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is projected at an airport surrounded by palms. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which would not last five minutes in the New England climate. In another plane trip, the starting shot shows a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel on board. As for the plot, this film expects you to believe that Victor, Arthur's devoutly Christian brother, is kicked out of his church when the congregation discovers that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor ends up with Victor to kill Ben and Arthur "to eliminate their souls from sin". Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this film would have no ransom.
