I've seen some bad movies (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so terrible, so BORING, that I came halfway and couldn't stand to watch the rest. A shame. Boasting talents like Kenneth Branagh, Embeth Davitz and Robert Duvall and a John Grisham story, what went wrong? Branagh is a very successful lawyer who has a one-night meeting with Davitz. His father (Duvall) is a psychopath who hanged his cat, etc. Etc., So Branagh sent him to a furnace, and he escapes promptly. Somehow (I couldn't understand how) Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger are all mixed in the story that moves more slowly than still. I wanted this, and, being a big Grisham fan, I read all about this movie and I (stupidly) expected something interesting. This is honestly the worst movie I've seen to date and I wish I could get my money repaid. * outside *****.
