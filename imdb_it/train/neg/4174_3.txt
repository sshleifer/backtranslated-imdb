Whoo-boy, this was definitely one of the best movies I've seen all summer. Sure, it was on Sci Fi, and I don't watch a lot of Sci Fi, but man, I'm talking about a razor-thin plot and two-dimensional characters at the most. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, the plot and setting were incredible, vampires were less intimidating, more funny, blood was not necessary, special effects were horrible and the ending? Well, the only unforeseeable thing about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts doing it with the female vampire, which, by the way, isn't that hot considering that it happens for about three seconds, where you're more next to "What the hell?" so "Man, it's hot". If this ever appears in replicas, God forbid, DON'T WATCH IT.
