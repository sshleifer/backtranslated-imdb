I saw this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from New York. After 30 minutes, I said, "Are you kidding? Is it some kind of joke?" He thought it was good. I told him I thought it was probably one of the stupidest movies ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "A propaganda film made for children?" The plot is stupid. Acting is the absolute worst for most principals and frankly the people who watch this kind of tripe and think it has something to do with life, love or even the afterlife, which it offers an incredibly vision idiot ... need some psychiatrist Help. Please, if someone tries to put you in your DVD or Video player, consider as if you had introduced a virus into your computer ... it will not destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they had created Razzies in the 1940s, this would have won in every category. (PS) It also goes under the doubtful sobriquet of "Stairway to Heaven".)
