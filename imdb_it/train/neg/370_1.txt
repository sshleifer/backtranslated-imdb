Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the 90s. The plot is completely useless; its shades of loneliness are pathetic. You really believe that a twelve-year-old who acts as a personal assistant for a millionaire can do everything in this film, like buying a villa for only $ 300. The notion, not to mention the bargain price, will only be believed by the most gullible spectators. Please respect your intelligence and do not watch this horrible film.
