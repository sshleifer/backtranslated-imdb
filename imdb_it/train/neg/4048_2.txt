Maybe not, but it's terrible. Even the fantastic cast can't save it. OK, I admit that it started out pretty funny but it seemed to fall downhill as soon as they skipped those girls in the generals' house. Bill Murray turned from a witty, witty man, into a jerk who was screaming things at people on the street that weren't funny at all, it's like he's trying too much to be funny. His character has stolen a weapon (an RV? Come on ...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. A positive aspect is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the American army and shows how arrogant and foolish they really are, even if unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released.
