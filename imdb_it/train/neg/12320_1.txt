No spoilers here, but I've been a fan since Waking the Dead started, but the last series, of which only 3 have been so far, is horrible. The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of ​​the series. I found these 3 in the last jaw drastically ridiculous series. As a BBC payer, after the show I called the BBC complaints to express my disappointment. I am amazed that the actors of the caliber of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone have not disputed the narrative lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, grumpy can see is lost all directions. It's a good job that the latest series or the next series can start with the team investigating Santa's death! <br /> <br /> Paul Bentley, West Yorkshire, England.
