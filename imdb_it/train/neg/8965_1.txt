This is practically a low budget, made for TV, a type of film destined to take advantage of the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-movies, and this might have been good if they didn't attack the name "Cube" because, as it is, the director and the plot of the original were better, and this movie almost ruined my taste for the whole series. The characters are annoying and clich√©, there are problems with continuity and a lot of production flaws. History has almost no chance of developing because of unnecessary dialogue and suffers from it. They use more or less the same horror over and OVER tricks for the whole movie, and since the first one was so good, this is simply disappointing. <br /> <br /> If it were a b-stand-alone movie, I'd probably give it on a four. The "1" rating I gave was pretty much a statement about how it completely paled in effect and intelligence compared to the first.
