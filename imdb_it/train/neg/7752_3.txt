The film is about a sabretooth on losing in an amusement park where teenagers are looking for scavengers. Since there are no rules, they enter a building and begin to be killed. The deaths are cheap and they are stupid. But at least it had better effects then sabretooth. I gave a three because there was Stacy and I loved the Sabretooth movie. I thought it was ok but some dead were off screen. There was a stupid scene in which the two boys kiss and the head of the sabretooth comes out and the boy leaves his girlfriend behind leaving her to have his completely fake red look. Then the sabretooth rises in the air vents and bites the children. The end of death with the owner was a totally false graphic. Even that death was stupid because the tooth of the statues passed through his mouth and hangs there as if supporting it and there's a scene where a goth girl loses her contacts she doesn't find them, and it seems she doesn't need of the. The film is idiotic and a waste of time.
