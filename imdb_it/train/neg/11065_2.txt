This film had so much potential. Anyone who has followed Jeffrey's story knows that there are so many details overlooked in this film that is ridiculous. Too many hours and efforts in Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and alcohol consumption have been spent in the film. Where was the character development? The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the film does he turn to his adolescence when he started killing and maiming small animals? Instead we are giving a dizzying series of flashbacks that try to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the main point of Dahmer's development. Furthermore, the reason why the country became so fascinated by this story were the details: how it kept the bodies in its apartment and the lengths and measures to which it went to achieve this goal; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on, but to sum up, too many points of delay in the film, focused on her sexuality and not enough of the blood - the good things you would expect to see when the film's title is "Dahmer".
