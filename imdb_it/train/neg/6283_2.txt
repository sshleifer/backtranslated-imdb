What an incredible fall for Sean Ellis. <br /> <br /> You have gathered a group of your friends at home, they all talked about Sean Ellis's next work. You have a vague idea of ​​the plot, no spoilers that could kill the fun, very high expectations. <br /> <br /> It's deep night, perfect atmosphere for a film of this type. <br /> <br /> Spend 15 minutes and start telling yourself that you have to collect, at 25 minutes you start wondering if you should go to sleep and save this for another time when you can fully appreciate it the subtle touches that do not exist. Within half an hour you realize that half of your exaggerated audience is already asleep and calls him one day. <br /> <br /> A few days later, when you run out of material to see you return to this, in the middle of the day, this time, hoping that your mood will keep you awake this time. 10 minutes later you find yourself creating fastforward transitions and incredibly long and unnecessarily long intermediate images. Anything else I would have already given up, but there is the cashback and its inheritance. But that legacy cannot but take you so long, this is a new level of boring film making, imagine a short story extended to a novel with only descriptions, this is what it is. <br /> <br /> The right cast is wasted, there is no cinematography that leaves you spellbound like cashback. There are films that annoy you, there are films that lack certain aspects, or simply cheese, unfortunately this is just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Final words, stay away.
