Wow you guys are too cute !!! Corny, Corny, Corny Here's how I feel about that movie. It started well with a good idea, A boy (Edward Asner) escapes from the prison dressed as Santa Claus, a group of kids finds him and believes he is the real Santa Claus, so the fake Santa Claus will enlist the children to help him find a lot of stolen money. The film is like a Christmas version of "Whistle down the wind". The film starts well but gradually becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that in the end it becomes ridiculous and you can't take this movie seriously. For example, you get the Scrooge-like character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who is a total Douchebag who treats his young son like a pile of garbage, treats his son so badly that he doesn't even buy decent clothes, the poor boy wears jeans with holes in it! but a 45-second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and at the end of the film gets the boy all happy singing Christmas Carol and giving the careless son a hug ... yes, that's how Corny is ... I'm all for feeling good, especially during the Christmas season and I'm a big fan of seasonal TV movies, but this is too exaggerated for me, it's a shame because it started well, but the second half of the film is a supernatural element that the movie doesn't match the rest. It's not entirely negative, there are some solid recitations, especially from children, but there are many better Christmas movies around.
