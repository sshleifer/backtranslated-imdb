As for cinematography, this film was pretty good by the mid-1950s. There have been some times when the lighting was too hot, but the shots were generally framed and kept in focus. The acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the management was horrible. Several scenes were dragged too long in a suspense attempt and the effects were non-existent. The attack of the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and any attempt to bring the skull back to life was obvious, with strokes and ropes. Besides, I couldn't help thinking that the budget didn't allow them to furnish the house, so they continued to make references to the movers and that all the things in the warehouse would arrive soon. Honestly ... it would have been more fun if it was a worse movie. It wasn't bad enough to be a "good-bad" movie, but it wasn't good enough to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
