I must say that I am quite disappointed with this "horror" movie. I didn't even get scared once while watching him. It is also not very suspenseful ... I was able to guess the ending in the middle of the film ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a really cool movie. .. I would like other films to stop copying from it (for example the brand: long hair). Please give me some originality. <br /> <br /> We do not recommend this movie.
