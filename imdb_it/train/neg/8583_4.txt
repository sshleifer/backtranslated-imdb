Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen over a typical advertisement, we tend to lose interest very quickly. <br /> <br /> I have discovered an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint the high voltage utility poles and do it at a time! And guess what, they really want to do something else (the viewer has similar feelings). Surprisingly, when I was bored watching the infomercials late at night and decided to watch this movie, I found the characters are interesting and very engaging. <br /> <br /> I simply don't usually watch TV late at night, so I can't recommend this movie, unless looking at paint is your idea of ​​two exciting hours out of your life.
