This film is poor in garbage. It has a horrible taste and is pedantic and unconvincing in the script, although supposedly based on real events - which does not add much of anything, but makes it more of a disappointment. The direction is not well done as scenes and dialogues are out of place. I'm not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or in this story. To begin with, Williams is not as convincing as a gay in a relationship break nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is driven by a bad pedophile story that is basic and has no space as a plot device. You have an old Rory Culkin who snorts without taste "d_ck_smker" - in a funny way - which is quite annoying and then derided by the character of Williams. Finally you have Sandra Oh as Williams' guardian angel counselor and a thrown in explaining the whole fiasco near the end. The character of Toni Collete is simply annoying and a re-hash of his sixth show with a worse direction. Very incapable.
