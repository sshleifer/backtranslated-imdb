This could be the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical ever. The music has also been destroyed. Attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and every moment sounds fake. I will say, however, that it is almost bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> The hairstyles are extraordinarily dated. I cannot for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where "A Chorus Line" is playing. Do we have to think that these people are doing auditions for "A Chorus Line", which contains stories about the people they are listening to? Oh no, the show is collapsing on itself. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album hundreds of times. Why, oh why, did they do this?
