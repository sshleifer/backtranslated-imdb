This film is in no way funny, it tries to be funny with its lame humor, which is so dry and boring that the film is only 2 hours of torture. For the whole movie I was thinking, "when this ends". One thing you have to give them, is that they have a few slightly fun moments, and that's also why I gave a whole 2 star rating. It's not original and uses almost all the old blond jokes in the book, even those that weren't funny the first time. It's basically a movie to downplay blondes and record the whole repertoire of blonde jokes. <br /> <br /> To summarize, this film is a bad-looking blond humor, it's not worth paying a sum of money for looks, it's just so bad.
