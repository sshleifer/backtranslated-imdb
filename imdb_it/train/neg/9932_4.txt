Dan Duryea, a perfectly respectable B-movie actor who made many fake lookalikes in the 1940s, can't do much with this: the young man is accused of killing an unhappily married singer; when he is condemned to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with the help of the dead woman's husband. After a dazzling opening stroke, the tap quickly adapts to the film formula B. It certainly looks good, but the end of the twist is colorless and the cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is a bit stiff. Based on a novel by Cornell Woolrich, and passable for a single vision. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
