Although the book was not strictly accurate to the actual situation it described, it still had a sense of Japan. I find it hard to believe that whoever was involved in this film was ever in Japan because he didn't feel Japanese at all. Almost everything was terrible. I have to admit that the actors were generally pretty good but couldn't get a chance to save it. Before the film started, I was surprised that there were only ten people at the cinema on Friday night shortly after the film opened in Japan. 30 minutes in I was amazed they stayed. I stayed so I would have the right to criticize him. The whole film was punctuated by my Japanese girlfriend's complaints and repressed laughter of disbelief. Everyone I saw coming out of that cinema had an expression of confusion and disappointment on their faces. <br /> <br /> You owe me two hours for the creators of this film.
