This film was presented at the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I did not expect the film as someone else chooses it for me. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that take time to develop, movies that allow characters to unfold and flow history. Calm is good. But this film was simply very slow. <br /> <br /> The credit must go to the two main players. There was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people, really misfits, come together in a very embarrassing way. There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them. <br /> <br /> I also liked the setting and the way it was taken. He was claustrophobic and monochrome and added intimacy to the film and reinforced the strangeness of the characters. <br /> <br /> I simply don't understand the ending. What was the point of all this?
