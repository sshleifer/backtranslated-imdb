Eh, not a good slasher hit. So I am acting, effects, decent but familiar and non-inventive music. <br /> <br /> There are three close deaths near the beginning of the film that make a scene good enough that it would seem all right. Besides this, there are a lot of characters that wander, don't understand what's going on, or chase each other behind false tracks; more time killings than people. There are other deaths and the murderer is a murderer of equal opportunities, not partial to any of the instruments. The killer also loves to set up other people to kill innocent people too. Identity is not revealed towards the end, and the reason is rather subtle, and we really don't care. <br /> <br /> It is assumed that the film takes place around Christmas, but this is not an important factor. A scene is illuminated by Christmas lights, that's all. <br /> <br /> The film is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape I saw. Some of the dialogues got a bit lost in some opening scenes. The ending should have been stronger than it was. We think we realize what has happened, even if there is a possibility that someone else has done.
