This makes Errol Morris' third film I've seen, and I don't always like his style. It seems that you find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries and then, with an ironic change, makes fun of everything they talk about. It's never a direct caricature of them and Morris almost always seems to say "But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!", But there are always these little rounded corners and an editing not so subtle techniques that show that Morris seems mock them behind their backs. <br /> <br /> This film keeps track of four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... a man who studies the gruesome African cereals to discover that I am incredibly formidable, a lion tamer, a man who holds a garden full of animal-shaped shrubs and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human and life aspects? So the title of Fast, Cheap and Out of Control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of movies ... right? Except of course Morris seems only a little disturbed by the passions of these individuals (he could call them "obsessions") by making synthetic drawings on life. I don't share that fear and honestly I don't appreciate some of the connections that Morris makes in the film. <br /> <br /> But I emphasize its subtlety. Without a narrative voice and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it is not as if Morris had ever beaten that anxiety on the collective head of the spectators. Instead he often mixes circus footage and footage of ants sometimes when they are taken out of the context of the circus and ants, showing a kind of collective absurdity behind what all these people talk about. I don't find them absurd, I find them all very accurate and interesting individuals. <br /> <br /> Unless, of course, he meant such juxtapositions, which means that he is just a bad craftsman instead of a silent subvertor. Considering that none of these films I've seen so far has particularly impressed me, I'm not really interested in finding out what he's trying to do. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
