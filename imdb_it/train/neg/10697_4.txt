First of all, I thought it was bad of them to say in the credits that the story and script were from Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood's best screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on the story by Robert Louis Stevenson "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will guarantee him any desire but that will eventually lead him to hell. All right. No one has ever said that the writers should be original. Actors are generally quite competent given the mediocre writing they had to translate on the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the finale. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked, but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel that they must provide a last taste of horror at the end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The old horror movies got along, allowing the victim to win in the end. There is nothing wrong with triumphing over evil, regardless of what the current production of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the public a good healthy scare and make them happy again in the end. In fact, I think it's preferable.
