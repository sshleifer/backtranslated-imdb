This film was interesting; I read the book a few years ago and he informed me that the function followed the plot very closely. <br /> <br /> I started watching it and almost from the beginning failed to meet expectations. In fact, I didn't bother to look at the whole thing ... absolutely unpleasant - bad performance, bad acting and immediately unpleasant characters - this was the point of the movie, I guess. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie left a bad taste in my mouth and put me up for the rest of my weekend. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this feature.
