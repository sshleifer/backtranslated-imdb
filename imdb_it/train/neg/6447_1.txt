I bought this movie for $ 5 in a business basket in my local video store for one reason, Chase Masterson, but I should have crushed it, tossed it in a toilet and blushed. The film is about twenty people who peaked in high school and gathered on the anniversary of the death of their idiotic friends, who got drunk and entered the woods and died. The problem is that a reptile monster will hunt them one after another. The acting is abysmal, these worthless people have apparently been engaged in shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The director was on a par with a twelve-year-old and the script was probably done by a 13-year-old. The whole set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people here who praised this film are obviously friends of the director and / or actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at ALL costs.
