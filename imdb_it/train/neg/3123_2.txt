I felt mine while watching this ... but it seems that this is the reason for the madness that runs in the family in this film. Not that it makes much sense however, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his presence on the screen that gives him any credibility. It's sad that all the great legends of horror movies in the age of sound were eventually reduced to low quality garbage like this. Marginally, Boris has gone slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not by much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to keep this mess together. Grinding background music does not help and distracts from every lucid moment. In addition to Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast is nicknamed in a strange rhythmic English monotone that recalls the type used in porn movies of the late seventies. <br /> <br /> I guess it's the "House of Usher" by Edgar Allen Poe that was taken from this, but it would be difficult to find a good deal of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> However, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, look for them and let it go wide, unless you want the curse of the "shrinking brain" too!
