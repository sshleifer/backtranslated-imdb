The deceptive cover, the title and the tiny hidden print of Power of Prayer led me to rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It started very well and pulled me in. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of it, the film began to introduce things that had not been created and that made no sense. My first thought was: "This is not written by someone who knows how to tell a story". In the end I saw some parts of the film, thinking that I had missed something. <br /> <br /> When I reached the last 1/5 of the film, it was all the DIALOGANTE TRAINER, STILL, RELIGION THAT didn't make sense, it didn't say anything and it was annoying to listen to it; I turned off the sound and made a fast progress to the end. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch out for DVDs labeled Whitlow Films and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I'm a practicing Catholic.
