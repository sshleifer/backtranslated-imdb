Now this film won't scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons: two big reasons and a smaller one, that's three reasons, isn't it? <br /> <br /> The first reason why this is interesting is the special effects. I found them quite interesting and quite spectacular. Watching hair grow on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning was disturbing, especially when they participated in a ménage à trois. Of interest, is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown" Sugar "of the Rolling Stones song, and that it was in the infamous nude scene in the London cast of the musical rock Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to special effects, there were two other important points in this film and they were taken out several times during the closing credits, I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning has canceled those points for us in the credits of at least a dozen of times and perhaps many more, they were the most extraordinary feature of the film.
