Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it is the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble origins, so it is prosperous, it becomes mobile upward, it changes its name and hopes to integrate into Hungarian society, so subsequent generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who have lost the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is acclaimed as an artistic success, but it is a missed opportunity. The plot, dominated by the history of the world, is predictable and transparent; this is reinforced with the narration of the vocal cover and the movie of the newsreel. The family "plot" fluctuates from a predictable event [eg the Habsburgs, World War I, World War II, fascism, communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The theme of Jewish assimilation is not focused and important sub-themes [the "secret" diary and the family philosophy] that could have given family character and credibility to the end. Alternatively, the directors provide continuity of generation using common themes of incest / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes shows flashes of genius, but his performance is far from the award-winning material. The casting format "3 for 1" is a distraction for the spectators and seems more like an economic find for the cinema than a good theater. Sunshine is basically a Hungarian "History Channel" material. It looks like Winds of War turned into Forrest Gump turned into Something About Sex. <br /> <br />
