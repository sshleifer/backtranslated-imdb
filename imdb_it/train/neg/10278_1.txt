the only worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I saw this movie at the Austin Film Festival in 2004 and it occurred to me that this film was accepted by a festival. it was an interesting premise, and it looked like it could go somewhere, but it fell apart whenever it tried to do something. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of a piano sound that sounded like they were playing on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were written terribly, and when they were not obvious rhymes, they were rhymes that induced groans that showed how much they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think to find people who could sing when they do a musical, right? not in this case. luckily they were almost talking / singing half the time, but when they sang it made me shudder. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and this only concerns music. part of the acting was pretty good, but much of the dialogue was terrible, as was most of the scenes. obviously they didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they constantly crossed the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the trick of making it into a musical. I hope investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake.
