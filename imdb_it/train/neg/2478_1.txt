This film is S-L-O-W. Most of the film was waiting for it to start. <br /> <br /> The setting was bleak, the script was bleak, the cinematography was bleak, the plot was bleak, the budget was low (not all low-budget films are bad, but this had no saving features ). <br /> <br /> The plot was more consumed by a vengeful hunter and a bit unbalanced than the royal Wendigo who made a brief appearance towards the end of the film. This in itself was disappointing as this "Wendigo" was just a bizarre mix of tree and deer. Everything about the film was uninteresting. <br /> <br /> The child's parents seemed rather detached and sometimes seemed completely detached from their child. I'm not sure this was due to bad acting or a bad script, but it only accentuated my levels of disappointment and boredom. <br /> <br /> There was no reason to think, nothing to arouse interest. Without a real plot or a thrill, this movie creaked so painfully, you didn't care about what happened at the end. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of Wendigo reminds me of the boring film shown at the awards ceremony near the end of "Mr Bean's Holiday": a film that is artistic and meaningless, that tries too hard to be deep and significant, but which appears to be pretentious and boring. <br /> <br /> I would never want to watch it again. I only saw it until the end in the vain hope that something interesting could happen ... but it is not.
