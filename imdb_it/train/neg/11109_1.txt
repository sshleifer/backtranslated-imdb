I'm really surprised that this movie has a ranking like this! I haven't seen a movie this bad for years. Every one of these was a bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe superfluous (almost amusing) blood scenes). If you don't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) .. well, this is 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goose bumps.! <br /> <br /> I can't say about acting since the script was so terrible. I clicked all the time. (Why do I have to write 10 lines? I never understood that.) <br /> <br /> == Here comes spoiler == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who always kills people in subway. We are talking about thousands of murders and nobody notices. In reality those people are simply missing. And there is the good guy who tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery to us because we know the bad guy from the start) and as usual nobody believes it! what a surprise! In the end he puts on the butcher's clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!
