First of all, this film is GLACIALLY slow-moving, and I can see most of the spectators lose patience with all this in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film was a creed that would form the basis of an excellent film; what was missing most here was a plot that would carry the underlying themes forward. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate, because in the hands of a writer like Lanford Wilson, I think that symbolism like a mountain lion invades a school campus could take on grandiose, tragic proportions without being heavy. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good script in support of the film, the director himself, with the same tastes and also with the same actors (who hasn't really had the chance to impress me), could have been able to present a significant and moving representation of the pains and difficulties that a boy goes through when he develops a powerful "crush" on an older boy he admires. <br /> <br /> However, I am sorry to say it without this foundation, and armed with a vague, obtuse and enormously uninteresting script, with no kind of plot in sight, and lacking any kind of sensitive structure (for example, after seeing it, I think you will discover that you can't point to climatic scenes, and instead, I'll find you to enumerate "well, maybe that scene, or that, were the highlights ..." - the result is 95 minutes of boredom . <br /> <br /> Without a good storyline, we are never terribly interested in any of the characters; their trials and difficulties are simply boring and boring. <br /> <br /> Without a good storyline, the dramatic devices and surreal directorial freedoms become bewildering and confusing rather than improvements to the plot. I could never really believe, for example, in the creation of "Leah" and I think most viewers would be completely baffled by the conventional way in which his phone calls were made. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid it's one of those I can't recommend at all. What I can never understand is why a film like THIS is not redone by an enterprising director ... instead of all the mediocre remakes of superlatively good films in the first version! All he needs is a good script, written by good writers, and I think this film can easily be turned into an unforgettable classic about an aspect of male maturity that is rarely covered in the drama. All the elements so tedious and so recherche in the film (the messages written on the boy's belly, the scenes of "Leah", the television fantasies) could become rich if supported by a good HISTORY. <br /> I see in quite a few comments that people are talking about this movie because somehow it is a "gay" topic, and I think it's wrong. Obviously, the "crush" depicted is that of a newborn boy on an older teenage boy, but Logan's character is too young to adapt to particular sexual choices, and, in fact, in his masturbation fantasies depicted, we all see the types of sexual and non-sexual stimuli, as we would expect in a very young boy like him. I believe "squashed" like Logan's are common among young males who grow up to have a strong preference for female sexual partners.
