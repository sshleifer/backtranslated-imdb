Corky Romano must be one of the most amazing and horrible comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> While the entertaining Chris Kattan did a very entertaining performance in the hilarious 'Undercover Brother' his character in Corky is so stupid and so unpleasant, which is a shame as the premise is a wonderful idea. A bad, they ended up when they got to page 3 of the script.
