I had high hopes for this film, since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But those hopes crashed into the earth in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Not even the acting of Heston or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or short nude scenes) could save this film. Some of the spatial effects were quite good, but others were poor. The plot was ridiculous. Even science fiction fans should skip this. Grade F
