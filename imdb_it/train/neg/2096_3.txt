Being a big fan of only 2 BSG seasons and the BSG Razor stand alone, I was hoping that this version would return the franchise to its original glory days. I usually have no problem with science fiction which is mainly driven by dialogue, as opposed to a visual mine of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas provided by good actors, it is possible to create a deep movie with a few pennies in spent CGI. This prequel has none of these requirements listed above. The world of virtual reality created by teenage terrorists was both ridiculous and incredible. This scene was simply put there to increase the evaluation of the release on Restricted. Not that teenagers don't love virtual reality mosh pits full of sex and violence and heavy dance music. It is the part of those same adolescents who have the intellectual depth and the political and religious reason or passion to create such futuristic software or become a kamikaze that perplexes me. These guys are certainly not from this planet. The film looks like a soap opera, only the last 10 minutes are slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz who gave his cyborg a devoted conscience through updating the students' firmware was fun if not fun. But this old concept was much better interpreted and much more believable in the brilliant and classic "Frankenstein" with Boris Karloff. Caprica snatches his only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror movie. No surprise there! Overall this film was bland and unoriginal and cheap, using CGI recycled by BSG's Caprica. I doubt I will watch this space soap when it is previewed on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless, of course, I happen to suffer from a bad period of insomnia and at that time this show would definitely be the cure. zzzzzzzz
