I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a child and was told they were REAL! Let's talk about child abuse. I would have been less scared of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only useful for people who believe in this ridicule and who want to indoctrinate their children to believe in the same way. In addition to the obvious problems associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there is also bad acting, bad writing and BAD "special effects". They are just terrible and terrible films. Yes, credible (and terrifying) to a child, but I can't imagine an adult buying in this shlock. Although, I must say, I would be interested to see them today as an adult. They might have some sense of midnight / cult movies for them.
