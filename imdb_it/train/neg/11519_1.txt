This is absolutely the dumbest movie I've ever seen. What a waste of a splendid cast. That is James Cromwell as the ignorant vice president. I could go on and on, but of course I'd spend more time on this review than anyone else ever did on the script. The only thing this film talks about is us against them and how to have fun with a profane prank beyond the reasonable tolerance of a human being. This is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen and I LOVE James Garner.
