I will not describe the story, as has been done elsewhere. We're big fans of Clive Owen and when our Netflix recommended the movie, we were intrigued. <br /> <br /> No wonder we had never heard of this "movie" because it was a BBC Television movie in 1992. So the poor production values, the grainy image, the snappy machine and poor sound. /> <br /> But you don't really care about mechanics, because history itself will put you to sleep. It's an interesting human story, but not at all compelling, and there's almost no end. You don't like characters because their lives are as boring as your life watching this boring movie. Save the two hours and do something to make the time more useful.
