I will probably always go to see a film by Woody Alleb, as you never know when he could only make a real return to his past greatness. Only one or two big moments or lines could make it useful. unfortunately, however, this film fails to make it. To say a thar actually makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure my reaction is similar to many other Woody fans, but what can you say? It's probably time for him to concentrate on his Clarinett, which I think is pretty good. Saying all this, I will probably still go to any new movie that Woody could come out with in the future. There is always hope and I will continue to love and respect WOODY !!
