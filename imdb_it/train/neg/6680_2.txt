Wow, what a snoozer. Definitely one of the worst bacon films. The bad acting coupled with a formidable script, if not incredulous, makes me long for the time I wasted watching this on cable television. I can't say much about this, a basketball scout gets too attached to the recruiting person, who seems to belong to a tribe that seems to be on the brink of a war that was decided by a spoiler for a basketball game. Degree: F +
