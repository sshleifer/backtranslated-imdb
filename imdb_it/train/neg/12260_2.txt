Sometimes I hit your head and think of the reasons why the movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still made these days. They have been doing these lame "Jaws" -copies since the 1970s, it's not like they're becoming more popular. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First he takes some secondary characters, then he starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nullities, except for someone who was a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal in some way, usually with an explosion. So we usually get one last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. Etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to even create some variation. Unless you count the fact that the "specialist" is a captain in this variant, in this case your standards are quite low. It's funny that it was played by Duncan Regehr, however, he likes being totally Zorro. I'll give you a bonus point for that.
