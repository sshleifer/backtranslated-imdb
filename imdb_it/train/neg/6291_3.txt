Now recently I had the pleasure of seeing the funny comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughing until it hurt me kind of a movie. So, of course, I wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would have the same laughter, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is produced by the American Pie generation where it's tasteless and defeats the purpose of the first movie. Yes, the first film has nudity, but it doesn't show in every single scene. Even the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but this may have been a little more original. The only thing is that I'm glad that at least no old actor of the original appears in this film, because it would have been vulgar or really stupid. <br /> <br /> Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only two months of appointments, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they are quite happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd is afraid that Ron will do his job. So they go out for a weekend in Miami for a bachelor party and Todd makes sure he traps Ron in a photo that will make Melinda change her mind about the wedding. <br /> <br /> Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a few laughs here and there, but most of all it fails to provide what the first film has made. These guys, Ron's friends, were more unpleasant than funny, with the exception of Seth, he was pretty funny. The only cute characters other than Seth are Ron and Melinda, all the others more or less get on your nerves. Want to see this movie? Look at Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing just not trying to pretend it's a movie. Follow the original Bachelor Party, this is the movie that will make you cry with laughter. <br /> <br /> 3/10
