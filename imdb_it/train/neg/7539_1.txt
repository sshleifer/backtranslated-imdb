Where oh where to begin by describing the complete misery of Neil LaBute's last attempt to make a film? <br /> <br /> There are many types of movie fans out there, but by far the most annoying and superficial is Mr. Intriguing. You know Mr. Intriguing, don't you? <br /> <br /> It's the type that no matter how stupid, lame and incomprehensibly boring a movie, says "Damn, I don't know why everyone hated it, I found it intriguing". He's the kind of guy who finds the scent of dog poop intriguing. Especially when he smears it under the shape of a Hitler's whisker on his upper lip and marches around the house ranting about the splendor of science fiction that presents subtly veiled references to Greek mythology. He's also the guy this version of The Wicker Man was created for. No one else could stand it.
