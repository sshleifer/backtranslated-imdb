as soon as I looked, I and my other half couldn't believe how horrible and sick it was. If someone else thinks it's good then you must be easily satisfied. Actually I gave up a night out to see this, it was all done before. IE. I am reminded of the hostel, but at least this did not make you shudder with bad acting and lack of plot, the same old, re-dotted things, I read so much about this film, I even recommended it to my friends, my fault someone said it was good! no more bloody, horrendous or repulsive in disgust that your average "scary movie" has to be said, please don't worry about this movie. mary poppins is scary now! I go out to the cinema, go to the cinema and watch something scarier than this, perhaps the little lady of the sun
