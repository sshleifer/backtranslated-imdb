LOVED this film as a child but, seeing him again over 20 years later, actually sucks. The Academy may have been ahead of time in 1980, but today has almost nothing to offer! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold up much better today than this steaming junk. No T & A. There are no big jokes except for the one-liners we have already heard a million times. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the gem I remembered being. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely recognizable hits (not the compilation smash that others had mentioned) and the frequent voiceovers were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me was to predict what the character's lines were before they told her. Yes, I watched this movie a lot back then! <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, I'm sorry to say. :(
