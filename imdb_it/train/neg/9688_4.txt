Greenaway's films are intelligent, erudite and innovative. Yet his style and his grammar have originated and remind viewers of films made in the era of the First World War: the composition of the frame, the use of the mid-shot, the static camera. It might be better to rub against traditional films with this style, but it's not new. Perhaps like that other "innovator", TS Eliot, draws more from the past than to look forward as a genuine innovator would or could. <br /> <br /> Yet the biggest failure of Greenaway is that it cannot write. His dialogue and even the structure of the plot are mechanical and logical, but without the vitality of another dramatic logic, Brecht. Where this weakness is most evident is in his humor, which is suspended and logical, so the joke died before it was delivered. The result is boredom: if it's not fun, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the public doesn't respond. Perhaps the educated director could learn something from Freud about humor. <br /> <br /> Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work as clones. They talk jokes bored and smug like teenage narcissists. <br /> <br /> This film, despite its design and lighting, is meritorious.
