Listening to this eulogy, I decided to watch it when I tripped over a cable. I don't see how this "eliminates" women and their "struggles" by focusing on the topic in question. I imagine that if you have an interest in stories about women's private parts and how it affects their lives, then this is for you. Otherwise, it's rather boring and boring. If anything, I found it a bit degrading. <br /> <br /> I asked a friend who also looked at this and thought it was horrible. So, he's not just a "I don't understand" guy.
