Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a she-male criminal who seems to have escaped from the WWF, has a terrible goal with a gun that has incoherent effects (the first one who shoots catches fire but when he shoots someone else they simply disappear) and takes time to caress a deer. Then you have the unlikely characters, 30-year-old university students, a lame attempt at a surprise ending and much, much more. Avoid at all costs.
