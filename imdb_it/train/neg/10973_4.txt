If you love "Pulp Fiction" and like portable cameras you should love this movie. I liked the eccentric story (although I hear that "Pulp Fiction" was the most overrated film from "The English Patient") and I found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It is not "On the Waterfront" or "Citizen Kane" and is burdened by European pretentiousness. But the worst thing by far is the manual camera. He's so distracted and annoying that I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this shooting method is so great. If you are prone to car sickness, stay away, the manual camera will make you feel sick in about 10 minutes.
