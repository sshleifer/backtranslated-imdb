I didn't really like this movie because it didn't really bring the messages and ideas that the Engle highlighted in his novel. We had read the novel in our English lesson and I loved it, I'm afraid I can't say the same for the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it did not make any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is why I gave such a poor rating. Don't watch this movie if you're a big fan of L'Engle lyrics because you'll be deeply disappointed. However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case), then it's a good movie!
