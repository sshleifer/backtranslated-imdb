It is rather surreal what these flies can do ... well ... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen. <br /> <br /> At first I have to tell you that I love animated films. Unfortunately, this year's repertoire is very weak. This comic is nothing but a list of defects: <br /> <br /> 1) I mentioned the tag line. It suggests that this film has great 3D effects. Well, I haven't seen any, at least not something special that I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> 2) The "flies" in this film do not resemble real flies. At least they could make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and thin torsos? <br /> <br /> 3) The plot. I imagine it was written for 6-year-olds. I could say it in two sentences, it's too simplified. <br /> <br /> 4) Excessive patriotism. For example: "They are American files after all!" Oh, give me a break
