Some children go hiking in the mountains and one of them enters a large tunnel and discovers an old mummified gladiator. He wears the gladiator helmet and spends the rest of the film killing all the other hikers. <br /> <br /> This thing is so utterly meaningless that it drives you crazy. Here is a short list of things that make no sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A boy and a girl are in their tent and think they feel something outside. The guy leaves to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he hears his girlfriend screaming, so they go back to the tent - they come the next morning?!? It was only 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) These two wooden heads hear another girl scream (What, 100 feet away?), But don't investigate why they are afraid they will get lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another boy and a girl are walking around, and in about their tenth scene together the girl informs the boy that due to the circumstances, the protocol no longer requires him to turn to her as a professor. I mean, what ...? First of all, this is just a really stupid thing to say, secondly he never called his professor in the first nine scenes they were together. <br /> <br /> 4) A wounded girl attacks Demonicus and he stops her, telling her that part of his gladiator training taught him how to hurt without killing. Um, yes, we noticed that she is injured and not dead because she is standing and walking around. But, thanks for that tidbit of information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is tied up in Demonicus' den, and when someone tries to free her, instead, she instructs this person to go and ask for help. Um, look, you idiot, if it freed you, which would take about 5 seconds, there would be no need for help. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on. The entire central part of the film is spent with the two idiots getting lost in the woods, then fighting, then pitching a tent and ignoring the screams of their friends, then they wander a little further. It's damn boring and useless that I turned off the DVD halfway. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are funny, especially those who get most of the time on the screen. Demonicus himself made me laugh out loud every time I saw him: he looks like a little boy in Halloween costume, scratching his face to look evil. He runs, or should I say he runs around like he's gay. Special effects are comical, acting is mostly horrible, and nothing makes sense. <br /> <br /> On the whole, perhaps this concept could have produced a funny film if they put a little more time and effort into getting rid of the ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with real nice personalities, having a sort of logical flow for action, and perhaps even making Demonicus a female character in a sexy gladiator dress. But no, instead we take this senseless pile of nonsense that will bore you to death.
