Hip. Erotic. Mischievously sexy ... anything. It's "The Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. The policeman saves the girl (maid!) From the big monster and refers to herself as her "protector". Lead actor Ryan Alosio does a great job of emulating Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre in a police area ... the villain is muscular with red eyes ... and also contains dialogues along the lines of " You said yourself, it will never stop, the terrible script comes from a screenwriter for the first time that, thank God, he hasn't sold anything since then, and it's all thrown together by the famous bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a strip of bar (always a good sign), and a mean-looking biker boy bursts for no apparent reason, chased by three policemen, one of whom is black and (shock horror!) the one that is killed in the first five minutes. The film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then resumes a bit with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the cast presents itself as competent actors doing what ch and they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to settle for less. If nothing else they seem to learn how to act in this film and Alosio, along with some of the supporting casts, shows signs of talent. Darkwolf in his human form is played by the giant Kane Hodder, famous for his numerous portraits of Jason Vorhees in the "Friday 13" movies. It's quite discreet, especially considering that he's not used to talking about roles. <br /> <br /> He became famous among the groups of horny kids for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who gets his kit from a couple of times in the great tradition of the former actresses of " Power Rangers ". And it is undeniably clear that the editor spent too much time on that scene ... however, the main redeeming feature is that the physical effects of the werewolves are quite good, and the wolf's design is not bad at all. But the CGI is bad. Simply ugly. I mean seriously, if you can't reach a certain level of realism - why worry? Just throw a little extra money into your makeup! Apart from the terrible script, this film has its moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. It's nice to laugh if you have nothing better to do, but don't spend money on it. Please.
