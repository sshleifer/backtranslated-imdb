I bought this DVD set, unseen view, and I wish I hadn't. The script needed a serious rewrite because it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book. The illumination is horrid, very rough, but if it were only that I could ignore it. The script doesn't focus enough on the characters ... there's practically no introduction to the various characters that makes it a bit difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in planes - it doesn't matter who dies when). <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good movie is to make the public care about the characters; if you don't have it, you have nothing. There was no attention on the characters - you never knew them - who they were, what they loved ... what made them do the things they did. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts ... I bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters --- they put a lot of filler ... I will say that it will spend at least one 'whole hour to see them land and take off in their LOL planes (I mean, we really need to see them over and over again ???). I would have given a much higher rating if they had simply improved our knowledge of the characters.
