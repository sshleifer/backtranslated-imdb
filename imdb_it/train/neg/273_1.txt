The sign of a classic film is that it ages like a good red wine. This film is not Cabarnet and certainly not Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the film are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us at night on a sit-com and the dialogue is prodded and beloved. But let's look at the obsolete theme of the film. <br /> <br /> With the passage of over sixty years of history comes wisdom. Since looking at the Rhine, the author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a two-dimensional plagiarist with her so-called "Julia" real life story from her book "Repentance". As one of the most heinous of a plethora of Western USSR apologists, it is obvious that his theme in the drama and in the film was to bring America to action to save the bloody Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists , who had just demonstrated their military superiority in Spain. <br /> <br /> As one reviewer rightly remarked, this is not an American play and film, since Lillian went to her grave a communist who hated Americans. This film tells the familiar stupid stupidity of the intellectual elites that formed the American left then, just like the full moon on the left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has now bought into conspiracy theories and once again given help and comfort to those who would destroy America.
