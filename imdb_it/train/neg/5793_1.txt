It was really that bad. Like the (fortunately!) Television series "Dirty Dozen", of short duration, played by Ben Murphy and produced in the same period (also cheap in Yugoslavia). <br /> <br /> I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and especially for Telly Savalas. It was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in "Green Berets" sums it up very well. > <br /> The other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable things that this celluloid crime contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I am amazed that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny helmet that Savalas wears on his large swollen head. <br /> <br /> I am also amazed that this movie train has a rating of 4.7 here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a "1" across the board. If you want a good example of why whipping a franchise to death is really a bad idea (especially over 20 years after the original) - look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Terrible - avoid !!!!
