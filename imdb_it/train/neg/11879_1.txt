My wife and I rented this film because some people had drawn parallels between it and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB have even chosen it as "recommended" if you like "Office Space". <br /> <br /> Now I have seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous and with characters that remind me of the people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office space" as both are films. That's where the similarity ends. We probably sat in the first 50 minutes of HT, giving him the benefit of the doubt, hoping, indeed, * praying * that he would improve. It was not so. We didn't make it anymore and we stopped the tape. Thank God it was a free rent. I would have been p *** if we had actually paid for it. We should be reimbursed for having to sit in it. Now, since we have not seen the end, perhaps it miraculously meets and redeems itself. I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Haiku Tunnel is so ugly that it's hard to believe it was ever produced. The film is so funny it is painful. Send friggin letters already !!! The premise is asinine. The jokes are horrible. We arrived at the "printer not working" scene and had to stop. We would not make it anymore. This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth. <br /> <br /> If you are an Office Space fan ... don't waste your time with this asshole. 0/10
