I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 1980s, so I tried looking at it again to see if my disgust for this movie was due to my film tastes in the 1980s or was "Stripes" it's just a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and "Stripes" is a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Now, "Stripes" may have been an innovative comedy in the early 1980s, and it could attract people who have followed a basic workout or who are Bill Murray's fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it ugly? Especially since "Stripes" should be a comedy, but it's not so funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic plot that is incredibly complicated and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is particularly noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies like "Anchorman" that tries to laugh in every part of the film. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" still suffers from Bill Murray and Harold The lack of acting skills of Ramis. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but at this point in his career he was not a very compelling dramatic actor and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two actors are not good enough as actors to bring the dramatic arc of the film. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy that is in "Stripes" revolves around the center of Bill Murray, smart-alec man-child character, so if you don't find that funny character (like not I did it) you won't find most of that little comedy that's in "Stripes" being fun. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is a film of its era, it has not aged well and is not worth looking at. If you want to watch a "buddy" play from the early 1980s, I would recommend "Stir Crazy". Like "Stripes", the humor of "Stir Crazy" is not as hectic as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes" has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.
