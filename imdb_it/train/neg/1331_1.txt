The collusive course is even worse than the typical "bad corporate capitalist white week" movie. This film is less pleasant than a toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good at his underrated debut film, The Silverbears, in which he gives a consistent performance with his character's needs. This film is such a bad character of Leno, a rude buffoon, he is less annoying than the character of Morita, a fussy fool.
