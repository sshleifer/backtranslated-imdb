Take young, beautiful people, put them in an exotic room, let in some bad guys, make the two protagonists discover romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the smallest plots, then solve a happy ending for everyone apart from the three or four that are killed, of course) This is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. It's not very good, but it's not so bad, like most small yellow paperbacks. And the location stuff in Budapest is particularly interesting, even if they didn't use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the famous thermal baths of the city.
