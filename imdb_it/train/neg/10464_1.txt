This film is not based on the Bible. Leave Christ completely out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Not to mention this. Does not quote from the scriptures. The final times are called the great tribulation. The film doesn't even show bad moments. The seven bowls, seven base and seven trumpets of sentences are reduced to a 15-second cast of sea news that changes its structure. The anti-Christ was killed for 3 and a half years in the tribulation and that's how the film ended. The only part they were right was that there were two prophets. Of course they didn't use names because they would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part was that I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people. I feel the film is evil. It's a counterfeit, just like everything the devil does. I just hope you don't take the outgoing movie based on the books left behind. <br /> <br /> The second problem with the film is that it was just ugly. Bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot and bad character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami vice.
