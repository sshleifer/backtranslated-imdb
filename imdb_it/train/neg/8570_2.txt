There is only one essential thing to the complete appreciation of The Indian Runner. Unzip the pants. Look in. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? All right, you'll do it. <br /> <br /> This film has all the male requirements: blood, guns, car chases, affectionate women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics - what did I leave out? - oh yes, blowtorches. <br /> <br /> As a woman, I seriously hope that Sean Penn considers this as a "when I was a child ..." kind of effort. Since he wrote and directed it, he is almost solely responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen brilliantly demonstrates how the work should be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. The lines and the action are there. Even the devout and competent acting cannot change them. <br /> <br /> I found this film childish and foolish, as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers along - Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to create a maternal wooden monologue without maternal authenticity. Then she dies. After a while, the same goes for the father of the protagonists, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is barely perceptible. <br /> <br /> At intervals, the pyrotechnic effects, etc., reported above seem to animate things and scare the public into thinking that something significant is happening. <br /> <br /> If you are male and under 25, you may like this movie. Plan to return to it at 35. Do you think you'll like it again? <br /> <br /> I don't think so.
