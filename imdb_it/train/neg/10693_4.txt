Maybe it's the dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, complaining or carrying on otherwise, but I found Europa '51 one of the most distorted (and therefore annoying) films I've ever seen. The film starts off promising, if familiar, since the mother Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with the spoiled son of a son (Sandro Franchina). While mum and dad (bland Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at a dinner, the young man tries to commit suicide, setting in motion a series of life-changing events and finding Bergman who spends his time pouring compassion on the poor and the needy. Spurred on by the communist publisher Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spends more time with the oppressed than with her husband, who soon locks her in an asylum for her problems. Bergman plays the role of the saint to the end, echoing his role in 1948 as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and takes it to the fullest. Unfortunately, the script has its turning point in the subtlety of the iron fist, while Andrea and his mother take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian banalities. With the scene soaked with tears, I had had more than one of these boring characters. A real setback for Rossellini who has moved away from neorealism and has further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of the Flowers of Saint Francis from the 1950s.
