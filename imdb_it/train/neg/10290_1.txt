I bought Bloodsuckers on ebay some time ago. I looked at the parts and thought it too stupid to review again. The excessive amount of watery "blood" in the beginning is simply outdated - not to mention the "whip" wind sounds. My friends and I have made a very low budget film, and the effects have outweighed this lousy fest. <br /> <br /> As for the amount of errors in this film, there are too many aspects to count. I knew one of the actors - believe it or not, he was my teacher THEATER. HAS! <br /> <br /> Final sentence: don't worry about this "horror" movie. <br /> <br /> 3 stars (of a possible 73)
