Why was this film made? Even taking into account the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors have given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the green light. For heaven's sake, the actors in the film are the Australian b-grade celebrities (not actors, people like Howson from Hollywood of John Michael, the original drummer of Hey Hey's Saturday band and the voice of Countdown. But in the to say it, this is still very watchable as long as you give it the attention of the brain it deserves: nobody, the script is bad (even for a b-grade horror that has confessed) and the acting and film quality is worse. a film of origin, but also a film of origin has a "realism." Anyone interested in Australian cinema, please, for the love of God, pretends that this film was never made.
