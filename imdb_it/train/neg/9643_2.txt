Films below average with poor music considering a film based on music ??? Script and ordinary management with many errors. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajay's performance deteriorated over time as his appearance, particularly his styles like Rock Star, was pathetic. Asin was just a highlight. Overall, I felt I was wasting my money on cinema. Salman Khan remains immature like 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the film all boring except "Man Ko Ati". The most important song to impress the music sponsor in the UK was quite insignificant. "Khanabadosh" can be easily understood by an English music sponsor. The other movie I saw last week was "Wake Up Sid" which was a simple slow love story with good direction and acting despite the average music
