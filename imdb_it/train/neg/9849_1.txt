This is one of the worst movies I've ever * seen! It's ugly, even at the TV movie level. The plot is devilishly imperfect and the known names of this film are wasted on confused and uncertain characters. I don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a movie together - it's so bad. Presented as a "psychological horror thriller" - it is certainly horrible. There is nothing exciting about it. And it could do you psychological damage! The initial initial scenes had such a promise: a possible embarkation on the fact that the soul is only one aspect of the brain, but the total debacle that followed the scene of the car accident is incredible. No matter how much you try, you can't care less about the characters. There are so many scattered ideas that the film is at best a collage of phrases disconnected from Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case the film would make you become a Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I have bought over 300 movies on DVD and this is the FIRST that I'm going to get my money back. LIGHT STEER.
