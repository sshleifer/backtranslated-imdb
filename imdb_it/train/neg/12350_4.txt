Hmmm ... where to start? How was a serious actress like Demi Moore involved in such shit? "First blood" could be evaluated as a bull *** but this kind of absurdity is only Rambo with tits, period. Of course if you are interested in shit (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the Navy Seals) that is the most stupid cliche you can think of, you will say that "GI Jane" is a great movie. It was Viggo Mortensen's performance that made this film bearable but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore as Rambo (especially during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott does not deserve the credits to make this film one that comes to women with equal rights, it's just mindless propaganda for the US military and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore inside. Terrible movie
