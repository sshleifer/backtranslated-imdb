One of those, "Why was it done?" movie. Romance is very difficult to digest. It is one of those novels, which, suddenly, "clicks" - are in love. The film is full of long breaks and unpleasant moments - the drive-in restaurant is the most notable. Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the film it's just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with his neurosis together for an hour and a half?
