What happened to Keaton is what I want to know. <br /> <br /> Actually I don't do it, I crawled away, panting, thinking that half of the bookmakers in Las Vegas must, or maybe not, maybe just been brainwashed, blackmailed and bored to death . Rich enough to adopt a third world country, she somehow had to act in another trail of drool'athon, cut by clich√©s, based on the same franchise of characters she renamed by "Father of the Bride" ('91) . You'd think he's going head-to-head with Mr. Bean. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> So the hubby (Dax) is fired from the boss's hateful son, his mother (Keaton leaves his father after the classic joke, and clashes with the his own show of dogs in tow, oh those little rascals, Father has cold feet for the diaper, the doorbell clock in midair and hey, we launch a space cadet as a second guest-house for good measure, all in one day because it is so funny and original. Wife gets tired and leaves, mom leaves dad for the cadet space and the couple recomposes in time for the credits, 86 minutes very long after. <br /> <br /> Now if you have to have a space cadet, he can't be sneaky, he can't make an excuse for his stay, and if mom leaves dad, he can't jump in a taxi dressed like a pumpkin just because some writers are tormented by the way they cheer things up. <br /> <br /> Also that gag with which they invited her just to find out who now has his canine entourage in the taxi must be outlawed by now. And you only have a hateful two-dimensional boss to denigrate. Another killer of the film would be the script of the film in which the cadet of space gets tired, presumably more lame than the current one, again, dejas-ad-nausea. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler doesn't look happy here sometimes her voice was weird, I wondered if she'd been erased a little later, and she's an intelligent person, she has handled great roles and we'll forgive her for Jersey Girl , was subject to disasters, could happen to everyone. Dax Shepard was watchable and generous considering the material. <br /> <br /> Personally, I am the director, the writers and above all the producers that I would like to see tar'n'feathered before being sent to Guantanamo as a game for the prisoners, and it is I who maintain this 'quarrel' .
