There was not a single saving factor in this film. The girl and I both love action movies. Especially fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was awesome), but this movie wasn't fun. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of conversation and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has seen the battle and therefore is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The army interrupted his bowel movements as well as perfecting his fighting technique. Even the music is not good. They fight with the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, because these guys are hooligans. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise for low-budget dramas. <br /> <br /> Everything about this film is in classic B style. The actors play their lines as if they were reading them from the charts and the lines themselves should be set on fire and set on fire in a rotten Hollywood alley. The film is called "Honor", but was not honored in making this film. It was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something I consider honorable. <br /> <br /> Go see Felon instead. Combat scenes and situations are more real.
