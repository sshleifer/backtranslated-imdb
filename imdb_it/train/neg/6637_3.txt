They should have called this film ... Blond women who needed to color their roots. Even the main character, geeze, sweaters too tight. The giggling. I thought the boy did a good job. I still hope to find a good 8-star Christmas movie to see this week. Throwing darts. Had to laugh about that too. We still have 3 other DVRs to watch, maybe we'll be lucky. Oh yes, I discovered the boy very quickly and nailed him when he picked the flowers and then went out with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were going to the cemetery. And how stupid was it that the two girls followed them there to spy on them? Horrifying.
