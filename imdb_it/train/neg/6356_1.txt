If I accidentally came across this text-based script, I read it and maybe laughed. I would not, however, laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want to laugh at me. Although I'm still not entirely sure where they are. I don't care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can't write dialogues, or at least he can't knowingly write dialogues, so he can draw performances from actors who can laugh at even the most clowning clowns. For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking for a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> OK, so the fact is stated, but honestly, do you know any art historian who would say it? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Really? An art gallery? who would have thought?" <br /> <br /> The entire screenplay is littered with the garish quasi-intellectualism that I never expected from such a respected character writer. I admit I don't know Allen's other work and, judging from this, I don't want to start studying. Are the characters disgusting without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really write really bad characters? You are the judge
