Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he seemed to be alone through the motions. He introduced himself, celebrated with his friends at the cinema and brought home a big salary. He didn't seem to care that the product he represented was pure crap. <br /> <br /> No movie has embodied this more than "Stroker Ace", which makes "Cannonball Run" a classic and "Cannonball" Run II "looks manageable. Save for some race scenes there is absolutely no NOTHING worth seeing here Even the beautiful Loni Anderson sums it up so badly like a stupid blonde is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the thought of Burt entertaining him with Jim Nabors and dresses like a chicken sounds fun then this is your movie, otherwise you choose almost all the movie comedies and it won't be worse.
