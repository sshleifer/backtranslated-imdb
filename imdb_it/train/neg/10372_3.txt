I really liked the comment of the first reviewer much more than the film did when I saw it in a second-run theater in the early 1980s. I was very impressed by the attention paid to creating costumes so carefully modeled after Tenniel's designs. But for me, the cast has been largely squandered, their personality softened by the masks, while the direction that I think is unusually static, and the murky photography. The score noted at that time was nothing, which means "not worth it once". <br /> <br /> However, I too would like to skip a chance to take a second look.
