This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, (yes it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any movie with Kevin Costner.) <br /> <br /> Chris Rock seemed very uncomfortable with all this film, and for the its supporting actors didn't even seem to be trying to act. Chris Rock is a fantastic stand-up comedian, but he can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two laughs in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching the dried paint on a brick wall. <br /> <br /> For Chris's efforts, I give him a 2/10! <br /> <br />
