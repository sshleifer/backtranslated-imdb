After seeing many of the reality TV shows of "Next Action Star", the epic TiVo recorded this wonderful triple for me. For some strange reason - and I just blame myself - I looked at it all, hoping that there was * something * unique about the whole movie. After so much battling on Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" with action movies, he may want to be sure to put his bones to alchemy. <br /> <br /> First of all, the only redeeming value of the entire film was Billy Zane, and he too could not lift the slippery writing of the asshole. That said, Zane's performance falters at around 2/3, since he doesn't even seem to know what else to do except look smug. <br /> <br /> I can't blame him here, though. The writing, frankly, sucked. Let's take the ideas from "Rat Race", "Enemy of the State", "Terminator", "Midnight Run" and any bad gambling movie that you can think of and simply repeat it. And who was the brilliant idea to have TWO pursuit sequences in a ROW? <br /> <br /> Sean Carrigan, the man of the moment of "The Next Action Star" shows all the strengths and weaknesses of the casting the directors talk during the entire series of the series. A johnny from a note, Sean plays the stupid athlete very well, but struggles with the weight of the film. Frankly, we never seem to worry if he lives or dies about halfway, as Carrigan fails to provide a reason why the public might like him. His stupid but lucky routine gets old when there's really nothing on the character to draw from. <br /> <br /> But Carrigan is a dream compared to the rigid Corinne Van Ryck de Groot. Did Howard Fine really tell you to pretend to be a Terminator for the first half of the movie? I don't think so. I expected you to mention Arnie. His "performance" character can only be compared to the dramatic depths of "Freddy Got Fingered", although it is not so developed. The camera loves it in dark and dark limousines, but in the harsh light of day its behavior absorbs all the energy from the screen. Jeanne Bauer showed a more natural life in her five-minute part that Corinne showed on any part of her screen time. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Sean looks good-looking to provide a good role in an ensemble cast, but he shouldn't have been left to do this alone. It was simply too big a task for him. The "Next Action Star" colleague, Jared Elliot, may or may not have had more luck with a more dynamic characterization, but it's hard to say given the lame script by Jeff Welch. Someone should take Welch's iMac away from him before he hurts himself or anyone else. And in the end, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outclassed and far from his reach, even for a complete fool like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
