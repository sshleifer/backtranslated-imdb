Of the three titles of Jess Franco to find their way on the official list of DPP Video Nasty (Devil Hunter, Bloody Moon and Women Behind Bars) this is perhaps the least deserving of notoriety, being a terribly boring clunker jungle animated only slightly by a little inept gore, a free rape scene and a lot of nudity. <br /> <br /> The beautiful blonde Ursula Buchfellner plays the movie star Laura Crawford who is kidnapped by a band of unscrupulous kidnappers and taken to a remote tropical island inhabited by savage tribes who adore the "devil god" it hides in the jungle (a large, naked native, with bulging eyes who likes to eat the heart of female single sacrifices). <br /> <br /> Used by Laura's agent to deliver a $ 6 million ransom, brave mercenary Peter Weston (Al Cliver) and his veteran Vietnam veteran travel to the island, but encounter problems when the bad guys try a double crossing. During the confusion, Laura flees into the jungle, but runs straight into the arms of the natives of the island, who offer it to their god. <br /> <br /> Franco directs in his usual torpid style and loads this laughable effort with his usual trademarks: crap gore, dark cinematography, fast zoom, numerous bifurcation shots, out-of-focus images, horrible sound effects and assembly with an iron fist. The result is a terrible chaos that is a real struggle to be faced from beginning to end (it took me a couple of sessions to finish the thing), and even the sight of the very sweet Buchfellner in all its natural glory is not enough to make me revisit this movie quickly.
