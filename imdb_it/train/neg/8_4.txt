6/10 Acting, not exceptional but of good acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Director, make some stupid decisions for this film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Writer, the story makes no sense at all and has an enormous amount of flaws. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Total score for this film. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it could be too much. The characters are so exaggerated than they ever can be in real life and some pretty inexplicable things happen "to tell stories", not in a good way. Because of the style that this film was filmed, you feel bored after 30 minutes (too many special effects: slow movements and camera movements and fast forward). It is always good that the film uses music to make the story smooth but there are too many tracks in this. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
