Terrible. This thriller should have been buried. How disgusting. Terrible writing, the characters are less credible. Horrible Schlock !! Attacks some B-stars in a terribly written POS to try to give him some credit, but fails miserably. If I hadn't had to write ten lines on this film, I would have given a word review, starting with 'sh' and ending with 'it'. <br /> <br /> Horrible end, delayed. Who writes this shit. The ending of this film is so invented, weak is like they had no idea what to do with this plot, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this film. It's a good thing these actors are about to go out, because this would be a career killer. Good thing for them that hardly anyone will see it. At least nobody is important, like future investors. He could have ended up in a thousand different ways, but as he is, I feel defrauded of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it, you will feel like you are losing time that you could never get back.
