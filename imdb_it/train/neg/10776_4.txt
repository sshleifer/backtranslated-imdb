When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it couldn't fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved him. <br /> <br /> We have been deceived, in spade. <br /> <br /> For my part, I heard Billy The character of Crystal was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. Of course, he beat a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but occupy space. <br /> <br /> And poor Julia Roberts. In past shows she plays a strong-willed woman well, determined by herself. In this film, he seems completely suppressed and has had very little fire. This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife likes to watch. <br /> <br /> OK, if I find something good, it should be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But, just like Billy Crystal, you see almost nothing of his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of mindless laughter with really reductive value, go see it. But if you're looking for an intelligent and romantic comedy, this is not your movie. It is none of these.
