My husband and I were intrigued by the show: a strong Southern lady with a messy personal life solves the crimes for the LAPD. The first season was a must see for us. Unfortunately, the stories of his personal life in the second season have become so boring and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were troubled by the episode in which she tried to hide from her mother the fact that she was killed. But the switch was the episode in which he hides the possible pregnancy from his boyfriend, but he tells his boss. Why would a strong, middle-aged woman do those things? The answer is that he wouldn't do it. Furthermore, my husband and I choose the villain with near-perfect precision. It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo in the crime scene or in an idealized family. Can writers not do something original from time to time? As I said, we are no longer spectators. We prefer shows that don't betray the characters and insult our intelligence.
