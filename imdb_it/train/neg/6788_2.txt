The idea of ​​In the Name of the People is good, a murderer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and ask the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And you might expect the actors, especially Scott Bakula, to play something good, unfortunately not! In The Name of The People it turns out to be the normal tear of Friday night. The flashbacks with the girl who was killed are rather pathetic and at some point you can only predict what the actors will say ... If you want to see a good movie on this subject, look at Dean Man Walking!
