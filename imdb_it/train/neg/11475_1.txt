A film that makes you want to throw yourself on a sword. I saw Schlock in my time, but after seeing the disaster I don't think I can ever watch another movie again. May God have mercy on the souls who have done this. <br /> <br /> Premise - Ex-Army Quiet Prisoner, model of character type underwear (actually played well) goes in search of the girl who sent him a Christmas card while serving in the army. He lands with his family of living-type granola-dweller, who is a right-hand woodcutter. The family takes it and it takes 2 hours of our time for the girl to realize that it is a better capture of her liberal appearance, drinking French wine, driving porsche, chatting at the top of her lungs, lazy, in the company of the city, Jewish boyfriend. <Br /> <br /> The Bad-1d characters, the 1d themes. Be overwhelmed by the head with the Pro-Military theme. Ed Asner. <br /> <br /> Good-trade interruptions have been long. Peter Jason. He finished.
