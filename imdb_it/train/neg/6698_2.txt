To say Funky Forest: The First Contact is a bad film is a euphemism of incredible proportions. I can really get into a good auteur film, even a surreal and twisted game like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because those films really have something worth discussing when the credits come out. <br /> <br /> FFFC tries in every way to be so deep and intellectual, in essence there is no substance in this film. This film is badly made, the images in this film are not stimulating, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this film .. I chuckled for the BROTHERS OF THE GUITAR, but this was immediately swept away by something completely useless and irrelevant . He tried to be profound and meaningful, I think, but it's just a bewildered and pretentious nonsense. Freshman film students without a camera could create something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and stand-up routines between one scene and another get 1 point each, all the rest is just a crazy, pseudo-creative rhythm, being good as other directors' movies REAL like Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that the people who are enthusiastic about FFFC are doing it because they have no idea what they saw, because they were nothing more than mild and relevant statements here and there mixed with stupidity and mixtures until you spew on your shoes. <br /> <br /> This film was an extreme disappointment, coming out of the level that was Survive Style 5+, a film that actually has a meaning, combined with the excellent use of landscapes, cinematography, catchy dialogues , funny moments, good soundtrack, excellent performances, fantastic rhythm and rhythm. FFFC presents the exact opposite in all ways, boring landscapes (20 minutes fixed on a bland beach at night? A completely white stage? Alien balls floating in white space? A school corridor and then a ... school corridor?), Terrible cinematography, forgettable dialogue, nothing funny or humorous, except the fact that you wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack ?, amateur shows, irregular, disconnected and often dragged out of rhythm, zero flow. <br /> <br /> There are those who say that this is what makes FFFC a great film, which is so unconventional at every turn that is its pure genius. This is simply a way to caress your ego, because "unpredictable" could be a good quality for a film if it was not combined with "boring", "innate" and "terrible". Personally, I talked to two people who admitted that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but the crushing rave of an art elitist made them review the movie and then come back to me with a ... "Hey it was pretty good I liked it ". <br /> <br /> I'm going to put my foot down, this movie is poor, I don't care if Roger Ebert says this movie is the best thing I've ever seen since he lost his virginity "The new cloak dell'Imperatore "I say ... this film is not indicative of the other psychedelic / sad films that come from Japan in the last 10 years. Taste of Tea, Party 7 and Kamikaze Girls are much better films (even on a tight budget), and no one can honestly confront Survive Style 5+. Watch FFFC only if you are interested in creating a pretentious stack of nothing with a low budget.
