I saw this movie recently with my sister who likes Sophia Loren's performances. They are a person they call a cultural barbarian. I hate art in any shape or form. Rambo is more my kind of film, action, killing, blood, horror. If you recognize yourself in this you avoid this movie like the plague. No one dies, no action, no nudity, nothing like that. Let me give you a resume in a few sentences. Start with 5 minutes of Nazi propaganda in black and white. Every Italian in a neighborhood hosts a parade in honor of Hitler, except for a housewife, an anti-fascist and a guardian. The housewife who is betrayed by her husband, meets the anti-fascist. He falls in love with him, wants to make love with him, but the anti-fascist is gay. Despite this, they make love to each other. At the end of the day, the housewife reads a book from her gay lover, and the boy himself is deported by the agents. The end. Do you want an even shorter resume? BORING ... Short enough? The boy should have used his gun at the beginning of this movie and shot himself, to save the public from this atrocity. A note apart from my sister loved this movie. As I said, I'm a cultural barbarian ...
