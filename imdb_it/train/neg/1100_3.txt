Since most of the reviews of this film were shot ten years ago, I would like to add a more recent one, the film opens with footage of German B-17 bombers, the film was played by Oskar Werner Hauptmann (captain) Wust and his character helpers who run to the shelter as they head to Hitler's bunker Fuehrer, once inside, are interrogated by the bunker staff, the film is then cut into one of the many scenes with Albin Skoda giving a good impression of Adolf Hitler who gathers his officer to "Ultimate Victory" while Werner's character is shown slowly realizing that the denizen bunkers are caught in a fantasy world - some non-bunker events are depicted, the most notable being the flooding of the system of subway to prevent a Russian advance through them and a minor subplot that involves a young member of the difficulties of the Flak unit and the a family in survival - this film suffers from a series of inaccuracies in the details that a German film made just 10 years after the Second World War should not be included; the actor who plays Goebbels' clothing (Willy Krause) is the same uniform as Hitler, including the armed eagle - Goebbels wore a brown uniform of the Nazi party with the swastika-shaped band - the "SS" soldier camouflaging of the German army, the well-documented scene of Hitler that rewards the iron cross for the boys of the Hitler Youth has been seen to have taken place INSIDE the bunker (it was taken out in the courtyard) and finally, the weapon Hitler's suicide is clearly shown as a 1922 Belgian bluing model - most of the accounts agree that it was a Walther PPK - some a little acting seems completely inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film which is remarkable, this piece is shown as a cabaret scene, with a wounded and intoxicated soldier (arm in a cue) the nurse makes a combination of striptease / belly dance, all by candlelight ... this isactually embarrassing to watch - the most unbelievable part is when Captain Wuster earns an audience only with Hitler from Skoda, Hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench, drugged and delirious, when Werner's character starts questioning him, Hitler starts to shout that leads to an SS guard mortally wounding Werner's character in the back with a pistol shot - this fictional scene is not based on any real historical account - Werner's character is then dragged to die in an antechamber while Hitler prepares his final, Hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but suicide is out of bounds, the last second of the film Hitler's funeral pyre slowly smokes forming a ghost the image of the dead man's face Oskar Werner Hauptmann Wust - this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to watch more recent films like the 1973 remake "Hi tler: the last 10 days "or the German film" Downfall "(Der Untergang), if they want truer accounting than this dramatic story, these last two films are based on first-person eyewitness accounts, with" Hitler: the last 10 days "compiled from the autobiography of Gerhard Boldt as a staff officer in the Fuehrer Bunker and" Downfall made from the memory of Hitler's secretary, the script of "Der Letzte Akte" is taken from the book of the American judicial judge Michael Nurnberg " Ten days a die ", which is more a collection of events (many obviously imaginative) of eyewitness history - it is surprising that Hugh Trevor Roper's" Hitler's Last Day "was never turned into a movie .
