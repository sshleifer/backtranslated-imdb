Control of the spoiler alert for any eventuality. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I've ever seen, Mazes and Monsters seemed to me to have wasted 101 minutes of my life. The only saving qualities of the film were scenes that tried to be serious, but ended up being funny because they were so bad. Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M & M (fortunately for us) he didn't develop a cult following and translates into a trilogy. This film tried to address a number of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered during the film. It ended up being a scary movie about stereotypes that helped fuel the D & D is the Devil's movement in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you want to avoid wasting time and money, avoid this stuff. <Br /> <br /> PS - Even if the cover looks pretty interesting, that's why I suppose my brother bought it, in no way takes place in a fantastic kingdom, unless you consider New England or New York City as a place like that.
