Have I ever seen a more shocking film? I can think of something that is the same as this, but no one who can overcome it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes full of flat dialogues. I am ashamed for all the people involved in doing this. Everyone brings an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the knowledge that this project could easily block their career. Even the many attractions of Mrs. Diaz do not provide an adequate reason to undergo this. Avoidance is obviously a cinematic style that Americans have not really grasped. Look at the final result if you have to, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn you ...
