Bizarre challenge the Cinderella fairy tale. A terribly poor screenplay, but Kathleen Turner turns into a pretty decent bad mother performance. <br /> <br /> Visually surprising in some parts, but that's all. Period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Move forward quickly until you see something interesting and save the 90 minutes of drivel. <br /> <br /> If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story, I suggest "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "Ever After: A Cinderella Story" or "The Glass Slipper".
