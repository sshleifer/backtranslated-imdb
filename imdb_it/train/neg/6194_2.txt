With a title "borrowed" by Werner Herzog and the liberal aids of Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut above the usual rubbish that our British cinema produces. "Robert Carmichael" (in short) presents itself as a realistic study of youth alienation and at the same time looks like a criticism of the war in Iraq. The problem with realism is that the characters are so blatantly unrealistic and atypical: contrary to the fetid imaginations of "extreme" directors, most teenagers are not drug addicts. As a criticism of the war in Iraq, a film on youth violence (by a talented classical musician - the subtitling society has damaged this sensitive individual) is so childish that it fails to think. There are signs of technical skill, but some reviewers have overestimated it. Like Kubrick and Noe, it shows that the desire to shock linked to alleged serious intent could be the worst film scam of the recent film. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they loved rape and violence, but above all they loved feeling culturally superior for appreciating the things they hated most. So too Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) here label him as one of the most fantastic films of recent years. (I am not against violence in the film, but doing it seriously is a difficult trick: people in the theaters applauded Alex in "Clockwork Orange" which showed how Kubrick's alleged intent was missing for miles. Free violence is much easier to achieve and is less offensive than the claims of many art film directors.)
