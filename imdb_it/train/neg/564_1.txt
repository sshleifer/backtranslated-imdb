The producers made a big mistake in the role of Mark Lester, who could not act or sing. Apart from his bad "acting", all of Lester's songs had to be dubbed by a girl. I don't know why they engaged him at all, because there would have been so many guys who could interpret the part infinitely better and even sing their own song. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, which should have been only 16. The current version of the West End is much better than the film anyway. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and is certainly much nicer than Jack Wild has ever been. It was clearly political to reward this old-fashioned musical with so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
