Slashers ..... well if you like horrors it's definitely one to see, otherwise don't worry. It is quite obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, for example it seems that the whole film was shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see Mike's microphone shadow and the camera shadow, believe me, you won't need to look for them. Try also to ignore such actors, if that's what you call them! Few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to the fact that there are 3 killers on the loose and those who live eventually become rich. Now there is something in this film that keeps an eye on you and you rarely find it with a cheap economic horror these days, For example, when I looked at it I thought to myself that I wouldn't mind doing this game ! in particular for $ 12,000,000. so anyway I would advise you to look at it and decide.
