Do you know when you look at your collection of old videotaped movies and understand that there are some that you've only seen once or twice and can't remember if they are worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is / was one of those films; I found it, not long ago, and decided that I could give it a chance. I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy with my decision ... on the one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape ... yes, you understand. The plot is predictable and not in any original way. The rhythm is bad. The acting is bad, but it's not really surprising, since the two protagonists are former soap opera stars ... they are used to acting up. The characters are poorly written clichés. The film even manages to ruin the simplest way to impress me (through cinema): court scenes. Even those don't elicit a single emotion for or against any of the skinny cardboard characters. The film has no real redemption qualities ... even the dialogue is bad. The fact is that it's so full of clichés that it's ridiculous. And this is the only thing that raises this above a score of 1/10: the (though not intentionally) comic relief of the many cliches and stereotypes. I didn't pay much attention to the film, but every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh about. One last note: I considered the use of the "Tori Spelling line cannot act" as a summary of a line, but I imagine everyone knows it, so I opted for the current one, since it's more informative. All in all, a really bad movie, but not the worst if you have nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a couple of laughs if you can sit. 3/10
