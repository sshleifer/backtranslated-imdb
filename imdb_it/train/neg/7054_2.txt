This film was absolutely pathetic. A painful script and the lack of a story left me alone to watch three losers drool over girls in bikinis. Sometimes I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit down for the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not at all impressive. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only interesting part of the film is the parody of Anu Malik and his obsession with shayaris. It was pretty fun. The songs "Sini Ne" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran who locks his lips and synchronizes his lips with a chartbuster. All in all, it seems that Emran does not have a good Bhatts script to support him this time.
