I went to watch this movie in our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To date (sorry Jack Nicholson), it's still the most boring movie I've ever seen. It went on forever without any visible point and then - it's just finished. The lights came on and I watched everyone look around confused. Had the projectionist missed a reel? I never had the urge to find out. All I remember from the movie is that it was a non-drama about some boring college basketball players and their coach. The most pleasant part of the film was the totally disoriented view of the public. Fortunately, this was only an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
