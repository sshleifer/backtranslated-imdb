We went to the film with a group because the game we were about to do was canceled. It is undoubtedly one of the worst films of all time. It's not that I don't like cult films I make. But nothing happens in the film. There is no connection with the characters. infinite times without dialogues. And the car. How do they carry a huge tent and chairs and clothes for each day in that car? It's a two-seater! I must say, however, that the scenery is beautiful, but not in a film, the director should have done a photo shoot of the film, so he could skip about 80 minutes of useless time without anything happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it, because it's a waste of time
