Director Kevin Connor and the aspiring action hero / romantic protagonist Doug McClure, re-team in this ghost story set in Japan. They had had some success together in the 70s, with the likes of "The Land that Time Forgot" (1975), "At the Earth's Core" (1976), etc. Without plastic monsters to carry the narrative, however, the results are squalid and derived in the most banal way. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century, with a samurai husband who kills his wife and lover before committing suicide. A step forward towards the present introduces the married couple Ted & Laura, visiting Japan and moving into the house where the tragedy took place. <br /> <br /> No surprise for what will happen next, with the spirits of the dead beginning to take over the new inhabitants with family friend Alex (McClure) taking on the role of the wife's lover. <br /> <br /> Everything resounds awkwardly together with the elegance and grace of an elephant in charge, an inevitable (but surprisingly downbeat) conclusion. The main points of interest are two weak beheadings ("The Omen" has a lot to say in promoting this as a standard horror set), and the love scenes starring Susan George, the overflowing but extremely extravagant. The first is a long piece inspired by 'Do not Look Now' with his hubby, complete with piano music; the second is much shorter (probably because of his insistence), the plot with McClure, both rather uncomfortable. However, each cloud has a silver lining and both scenes show their fantastic knockers so not everything is lost. <br /> <br /> Overall I can't decide if 'The House where Evil Dwells' is garbage, trash can be looked at, or masochistically funny. If you're not in the genre there's nothing here, but for horror there's probably enough to cause the strange rye smile and a nod of respect for the effort. <br /> <br /> BEST SCENES - in any other films, the big, black, tree climbers, the Japanese mumbling mechanical crabs would have stolen the show. But they are eclipsed by the legendary family meal scene, where a ghostly head appears in the soup of the daughters. Seeing this apparition, she asks what kind of soup (!!!!), to say beef and vegetable, before pronouncing the immortal phrase "Ugh - there is a horrible face in my soup". If this were not enough, the answer is "Let's go, eat your soup for dad". Laurel & Hardy rest in pieces.
