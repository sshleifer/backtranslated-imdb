I don't think you can go much worse than this. Put together bad actors, fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get? This unnecessary excuse of B-rate for a movie. <br /> <br /> The first story immediately shows the bad quality of the video and the acting is really very pathetic, especially when you take the 25-year-old posing like a grandmother with the usually grandmother sandwich over the ears. Moreover, the man is OK, but the woman is rather ugly. "You are beautiful!" NOT! The werewolf in this was the best of all three, I'd say, but it's still not impressive given that it was all a bad costume. The woman's face later was pretty decent for Halloween but not for a werewolf film. <br /> <br /> More stories go through the worst. There are two lesbians in this neighbor who are completely retarded and ridiculous. The whole "I also want to be a werewolf" "How could you do this to me ?!" He was foolish to say. You asked, now get out! The werewolf does not even speak of ... is a mouse! <br /> <br /> The third makes no sense ... almost forty-five minutes of running and boring narrative make up this story and the whole thing of the switch still hasn't made it interesting. Boring! <br /> <br /> Music, Yes, bad ... who could not even hear some parts was stupid. The effects of the animals were rats or pig-like, which was stupid. Couldn't they use the sounds of lions? Guess, GOOD movies use it. Well, i = f you like prices B that's good for you. I've been taking this film since I was a werewolf fan and will buy ANY werewolf movies and I'll watch it more than once, but that's just for me. If you prefer good ones, don't waste your money. I pray you!
