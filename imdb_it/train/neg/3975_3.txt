1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): typical Mary Kate and Ashley with a few more kisses. It seems to me that the girls get tired of this stuff and it will be interesting to know what happens to them if they decide to split up and go there on their own. In this episode of their adventures, they are interns in Rome for a "fashion" designer who puts them directly in the mailroom to learn what hard work is (I guess ..). In addition to the typical flirtations with the boys, there is nothing but the scenario of Rome until you get to the film when the reason for being fired, then hired, then fired again, then hired again is revealed. This is certainly done by people who do not understand the corporate world and show in their interpretation of it. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if there is one). Even my children don't seem to worry about this boring "adventure" in fiction. We see that they are probably only a couple of years old until their legal adults. We'll see what happens then.
