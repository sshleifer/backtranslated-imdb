Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly not very good. I'm a paintball player myself, used to playing a lot of airballs and going from the woods to the airball is a big change. The film shows similar qualities First of all the film starts with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this "Phantom" type or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot magazines, autocockers. A boy sports a bush. There is not much wrong with the film, but more how it is perceived that it was very poor. A group of guys who are good guys are woodsball players who don't seem to have much money and dream of getting "better weapons". Another team constantly takes them and insults them because they play blah blah blah and the ghost. The ghost helps these guys to play wooden balls and trains them and all this shit, makes them play airball and practically defeats all the teams, including the "professionals". <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? Well, budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie wouldn't be bad, but the budget is pretty low and the movie looks like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this film and the acting is very rough. Even the perception of paintball is pretty ugly. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other shit. It was just a lousy movie in my opinion and it doesn't give a real perception of what paintball is. To be honest, the real paintball is not all like a friend, it's a lot of curses and bonus dances that don't respect and respect the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go into a field screaming "4 is 1 !!"
