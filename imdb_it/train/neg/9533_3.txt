A text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our home, but I think the most appropriate word is "entropy". Nice pain, what these two girls are! <br /> <br /> George (Seymour Cassell) is alone in his office in San Francisco and in his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and son are in San Diego. Two girls (Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna) knock on her door, asking for directions. Well, it rains and they tremble like two kittens full of drenched rain, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and, with one thing or another, George invites them to come in and take part in his pizza by the fire. All three end up in George's bathtub and about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure, triple exposure, quadruple exposure and dodekakuple exposure follow. They spend the night in a trio and the next morning the girls arrange breakfast. But something got a little clumsy because Georgie's guests devour everything with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup over all the linen and - "Eat like ANIMALS!", Exclaims George and tells them to go out. In his dreams <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong. Sondra Locke is an extraordinary young blonde with cobalt blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces like a superball. You have to say that they breed in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where Locke comes from, and raise them with burly heels, as we can't help but notice after the first five or ten minutes. /> <br /> But when the girls go crazy, so does the movie. The film is then immersed in a bright green light. The couple wears a macabre makeup and makes gargoid faces in the mirrors. They have a deliveryman's brain and then drown him to be sure. They kill a storm and break windows and furniture. They have one of those scenes where two people sit on the other side of the table, licking the food and then skipping each other's bones. <br /> <br /> And Georgie? First they make Georgie unconscious with the bat (which contains nothing you can't find in that little red bottle of McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in the kitchen cupboard), tie it, pour flour and milk on him, subject it to a psychotic process , let him cross one of those Tolstoy-like semi-executions, slap him around, dressed in extravagant costumes, then hop over him and into his almost-destroyed upper-middle-class home, and be sent by an ex machina delivery van. <br /> <br /> As for acting, it's as if someone had told Georgie: "First act politely to these girls, then panic after you're tied." And to the girls: "First act timid, not wanting to impose on anyone, then act mad". And this is all. <br /> <br /> Photographic and localization work came out of a 70s porn movie. I'm not sure if it suggests a total lack of skill. It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco into a bad way. The score gives us two Leitmotives. Georgie's is a pop piece with lyrics that talk about "being free" and "giving up". Jackson and Donna's are a catchy thing called "My Good Old Dad". <br /> <br /> I approve of the moral lesson behind the story, though. There are some things that you should not simply give up, even if they may seem very funny at first All very educational.
