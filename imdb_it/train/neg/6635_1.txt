Four years after making his directorial debut with the snoozer art-house "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood to be one of the boys. "Roadie" is a frank frat-boy complete with bar brawls, horny harpies, Art Carney in a wheelchair rigged ... and Meat Loaf at the wheel. Meat Loaf (who plays Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a rather fascinating presence on the screen, and perhaps in a minor role (in a better film) he could really ingratiate himself, but the Zalman King script is full of stereotyped and powerless humor The meatloaf is kept with wide eyes and the fool. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr. and Blondie make all the appearances - and everyone seems embarrassed. Of course, "Roadie" is a bad trip. NO STARS from ****
