After watching this film, I felt the irresistible need to vent some of my frustration. Selma Blair is a fabulous and currently undervalued actress and Max Beesley was quite charming in "Kill Me Later". The story, although not exactly original, has certainly shown some promises. None of this mattered ... for nothing. <br /> <br /> I don't know what his agreement is, but director Dana Lustig has virtually no talent as a director. He slowed the movie down, accelerated the shooting, reversed the video, used the inconvenient corners of the camera, used annoying color filters, made quick cuts, jumped back and forth in the timeline and completed the whole thing with an odious soundtrack modern "junk rubbish. I can't remember the last time I saw such incompetent work directing a film. His ego must be huge to release acting and history and put his direction in front of and in the center for the members of the public to be aware of. He fills his throat. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of good scenes in "Kill Me Later" that show what could and should have been. Unfortunately, just at the moment when things would start showing promises, Ms. Lustig would dig into her bag of tricks for film school and scrambling things. It's a shame because Blair and Beesley have had good chemistry and you could say that the film really does have a good heart. 3/10
