The idea behind THE LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story becomes a bit boring towards the center and the excessive use of repertoire material and poor special effects sink the film to the level of sub-par. /> <br /> The film begins with a missile heading for Earth. In a panic because he is about to hit the Earth, the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This is not necessarily good, however, since this seemingly unmanned vehicle has a vapor trail that destroys everything it encounters and the ship is now in low orbit on the planet. In other words, with every step he takes, a wave of death follows - one that could potentially kill us all !! Therefore, it is up to the good scientists of the United States (led by Robert Loggia, very young and hardly recognizable) to formulate and plan to save us - and above all to save New York in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, I'm not able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't say if this is a big loss) but thanks to good old American know-how, I am able to destroy this omen of destruction !! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​the story is not bad and rather original. But, so many old fighter aircraft clips and guys who equip radar scopes gets a little old and looked like an upholstery. Overall, a discreet but hardly inspired movie that extreme fans of the genre - all the others, can see at their own risk.
