I must say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a nice enough plot to go on, but that messed it up so bad. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble (crap actor btw) and daddy dad end up ??? It looks like Carlito came out of the hood, and he used to hang around with real idiots. This film does not do justice to "Carlitos Way". I'm so glad the sequel "Carlito's Way" came out first, if I had seen this garbage before, I would never have given Pacino's version a chance. And anyway, Pacino should have read this story, he thought it was crap and instead made the sequel. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 in 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
