Despite a pleasant plot and an expensive production one wonders how a director can commit so many clumsy cultural mistakes. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Apparently not on the payroll. <br /> <br /> A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities he saw taking place before his eyes. In a later conversation, he said: "Imagine a Finnish director making a film at Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors like soldiers of the army and French like the Confederates. More worse, imagine dressing the female protagonist of Scarlet O Hara in a vintage circle skirt lacks the circle and sports a 50s hairstyle. Perhaps some people in Finland might not realize that the circle skirt "missed the circle" or recognize Jane Mansfield's bizarre hair, but to Atlanta wouldn't believe their eyes or ears ... and laugh in the corridors ... excellent story and photography are damned. <br /> <br /> So ... watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, the geisha or Japanese dress, and Hollywood is incredible for his myopic view of film production, which often pick up the big figures as they leave that the details that really polish the refinement of a film are embarrassing. I thought "The Last Samurai" was the coronation the result of how bad an otherwise good movie in Japan could be. The memories of a geisha are embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
