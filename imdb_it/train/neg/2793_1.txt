It thus places itself at the top of the list of the worst films I have seen so far on Starz on Demand. They seem to collect all the DVD dumps they can find and put them here. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a tight budget can come up with a horror movie and put it on TV. To be honest, this was terrible from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave a real chance. <br /> <br /> I always try to have an open mind about low budget films. Some of the best movies I've ever seen are films that have worked around their low budget or in other cases have only required a low budget to be great. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You know the plot now, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. This is a pathetic and plaintive girl we know for all 3 minutes in an incredibly bad heavy metal music video. Whoever put it together must have thought it was really interesting, but it really isn't. Anyway, kill yourself. So you own someone. Then the killing begins. It's really not memorable and completely average and boring as possible. When the first gunshot goes off in his apartment, it sounds quite seriously like a piece of popcorn. Was it the best sound effect they could invent? I could find a better sound effect to use for free, (without copyright,) on the Internet ... right. Now. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by other reviews that claim that it is a 10-star movie. Obviously, I am the film's distributors or maybe even the director who tries to convince you that this piece of junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous.
