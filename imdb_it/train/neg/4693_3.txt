This is exactly the kind of film that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great potential for stories, then they ruin everything with a script that is not going anywhere ... and says nothing as you go! There is no depth here. No depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, suspense or common sense. We know what is happening, we are told how they plan to solve the problem, they solve the problem, they throw us a surprise towards the end that does not generate any suspense, so the film ends abruptly. Wasted opportunities. <br /> <br /> As for the positives, Glenn Ford is at the head of a cast of British (and French) actors all fantastic, who do an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they received. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", who provides some wonderful pieces of humor and warmth in a dark and serious film. I also thought the film looked good ... all the shadows and the fog ... a lot of film in hearing. <br /> <br /> Even if the actors do the best they can and the direction is fun, it's still not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are much better Glenn Ford movies out there: The Big Heat, Guild, Affair in Trinidad, etc.
