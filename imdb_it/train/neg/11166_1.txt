I am sure that in the recesses of Jack Blacks the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely funny but it is not. You can tell Jacks that he has a whale of the past that intrudes on playing a slimy and slimy Mexican friar with the dream of becoming a wrestler but this film is a total lack of fire in almost every single department. <br /> <br /> I sat most of the movie thinking "This should be fun" and "This is the guy from Tenacious D right?" The truth is that this film has NOTHING to offer. AT ALL! It's a lousy script with disgusting characters and really unpleasant acting and direction. You'll look at endless moments when you think something funny is about to happen, but it's not. I was stupid bored for about 10 minutes, but although it would certainly have improved. It was not so. 90 minutes later I could barely avoid an aneurysm and it was painful. <br /> <br /> It's like, remember years ago when you saw something with your favorite actor, even some of their first The first dads of before were famous, and you would be really embarrassed by the fact that said actor was actually in such a situation. Yes, it is. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of the previous Jack Black movies like Shallow Hall and I'm really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny, but give the man. If you do it again with me, Jack, I'll have to come here and hammer the knobs or something. At least I tell you to talk seriously. I know it's a clich√©, but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and for so many reasons ....
