What this film fails to answer is how wrong this war is (and most of the American wars recently made just to get some oil). How many innocent civilian victims there have been, how many lives have died and how blatantly the perpetrators are stupid. <br /> <br /> So let me ask you: if the American soldier kills women and children separately from the enemy, it's OK, but if the government accidentally kills its forces with deadly chemicals while killing many civilians well, don't it is? Your logic fails, gentleman. <br /> <br /> I will give you 5 for the solid performance and 1 for everything else, 3 in total.
