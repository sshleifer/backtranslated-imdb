I'm a big fan of Ludlum's work and covert-one, and I've always thought about how incredible it would be to turn them into a movie. Imagine my excitement, therefore, in learning that such a film really existed! The "Hades factor" was the first of the series to seem like an obvious place to start. <br /> <br /> From the beginning the film was disappointing. Simple elements of the film like Griffin's first encounter with Smith are unnecessarily different from the book and much less hilarious. Even many characters are poorly cast. For beginners, Dorff is as sad as Smith. He is not a bad actor, he is just an incredibly bad choice as he is too soft and fails to show many of the definitive features of John Smith. <br /> <br /> Renaming, reassigning and even omitting some characters further degrades this film. For example, the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM, makes the whole point of the film somewhat confusing. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the place he variously takes a back seat (not to mention that the character of the film does not share anything in common with the character of the book) is another big mistake. <br /> <br /> Rachel Russel supposedly should be Randi Russel from the book. Not only should she be Sophie Amsden's sister (she should be called Sophia Russel), but she should also work at the CIA, NOT "Covert-one". Which brings me to my final point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at this point! Not until the second book in the series is Covert-One conceived by the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I could go on all day. In short - if you like books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action film it is completely average, mainly due to lackluster editing and negative effects. The uncertain plot and the faded script are the final nails of the very cheap coffin of this film.
