The Tree of Palme teasers try to pass it down as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with a real meaning, so they immediately start deliriously animating. I should have known what he meant. <br /> <br /> The main character, Palme, is a good example of the whole movie problem. One minute, Palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psychopath with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once occupied. <br /> <br /> Like all the characters in the film, Palme is poorly defined. There is no connection with the characters, although Shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. It seems that the writer was more interested in including all the drama and complexity he could in this film rather than exploring the motivations and personalities of his characters. <br /> <br /> New, useless stories have been introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the film. The writer seriously needed to rationalize his story. Maybe he was trying to be epic, but it was just too much information for a two-hour movie. However I can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a TV series or a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes of the film, I could simply not stand the sheer lack of quality and began to laugh at how the characters, relationships and the whole plot were invented. I touched my partner and he started bursting too, like a young man sitting behind us. We tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply couldn't stand the terrible quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs. The animation guides you almost; when you don't care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.
