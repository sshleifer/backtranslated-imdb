Even when I saw this film in a teenager, I wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora was acting in a movie about an artist who slept to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs. Zadora, she too could not maintain this excuse as a nuisance of a tank movie. Not even his photo shoot for Penthouse, in which "The Lonely Lady" was promoted "later in the day", could keep this tank film. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this a miss.
