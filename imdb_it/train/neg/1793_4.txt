An interesting concept of vampirism that has something to do with a virus (but done several times now) Overall the film is too long and drags a bit. The assembly could have been narrower. I'm sorry to hear about the credit problem. Perhaps the film was brought to the market. The lighting was too dark in some places. But the worst technical problem is audio. The level was good enough to listen to the dialogue, but many of the interiors echo for them, which is very annoying. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mixing could have been better. Even the background noise has passed too. He should have gotten someone to make sound effects for martial arts scenes. The clash of swords that struck together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the fighting scenes the editing had to be narrower. <br /> <br /> Even the acting was a bit flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that the same person writes and acts in a movie, in my experience it's a red flag. <br /> <br /> But it was a good effort, so I gave a 4.
