It is difficult to put into words the almost boiling hatred I have of this film. But I'll try: <br /> <br /> Every other word was an exhalation, the sex scenes were uncomfortable, drugs were rampant and stereotypes were beyond the norm, if not offensive to Italian-Americans. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the acting was terrible, because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. al, it worked well. But ... almost all the characters in the movie I despised. Not since The Bonfire of the Vanities didn't like every character on the screen.
