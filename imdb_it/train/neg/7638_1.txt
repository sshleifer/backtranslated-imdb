I couldn't even take me to watch this movie until the end. I can't comment on the story because I didn't watch the whole movie and the reason I couldn't see it was because of the "actors". First, for the most part they seemed stiff and I'm sure their scripts were in their freshly baked hands - but that's a secondary issue. The main problem I have with the actors is not really their fault ... it's anyone who launched this movie! Come on, this movie was released in 2003 ... I thought that the casting of people who were just over twenty to play teenagers were going out of fashion with the new wave ?! I can't watch a movie where one of the first lines, from an adult man older than me, is "I'm 17!" How can anyone take it seriously ????? Don't fall victim to this movie, go for a walk for 90 minutes and you will get much more than this movie can ever give.
