There is a reason why some movies go directly to the video and obviously the obvious reason is that if it is too bad for the theater audience, then go directly to the video. Obviously it would not be fair that the films are good and yet they are also published directly on video. This is not an exception, even if the film has good actors or at least actors with potential: Amy Adams (nominated for an Oscar and talented actress), Robin Dunne who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sarah Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from the teen melodramas. The film is also wrong: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions so, therefore, this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid. This was a waste and it is really a film that is on the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation movies. Fortunately for the actors, hopefully they will be able to delete this from their resumes. So if you're trying to see something bad, but don't dare to buy porn, then rent this movie as an appetizer.
