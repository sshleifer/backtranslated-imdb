"CIA Codename: Alexa" is a horrible rip-off of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman who is welcomed and trained by the CIA and is forced to do a secret mission for them. (Basically the same plot of the story of La Femme Nikita) The combo acting of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in film history. Lamas's "acting" is simply a bad imitation of Steven Segal. Watching Orenthal play in this film is a terrible experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting are so poor in this film that it is sometimes ridiculous. There are so many "conventions" of action films in the film that it's ridiculous: useless car explosions, people flying through windows, terrorists, poor ponytails, etc. The musical score recalls the soundtrack by David Michael Frank for "Hard to Kill" (1990), which promotes the Steven Segal theme of this film. There are many martial arts in the film, and it's pretty well done for a low budget American production. The unintelligent action and superior acting never subsides, and I must admit I was moderately amused. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas looked like an action star in the early 1990s, but he is certainly not an action star, which is why he is doing soap operas and not action films. My recommendation is to skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check "La Femme Nikita" instead.
