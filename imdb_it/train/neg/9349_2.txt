This film was terrible. I gave the highest score of 2 as I've seen worse, but very little. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning clich√© of having the end of the film at the beginning and going back to the beginning at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in the creation of films just for the fun of it, like a child with too many toys. There was the interminable, boring repetitive narrative, slow motion, still image, flashbacks and images combined, etc. - none of which made a film more boring. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little to drink or get drunk and no representation of the retreat with the film that jumped everywhere without a coherent sense. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a pity that people have raised additional funds for other films by Mr. Jobson, who previously knew he was in a garbage group and on television had so much sense how this movie does. <br /> <br /> I found an important fight to see this until the end but in the hope that it would improve I continued to love it but it was really a waste of time and I would have been better not to worry.
