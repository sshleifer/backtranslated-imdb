This is based on unironic notions of becoming aware of guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill scolds the upset boy to stop his "lament" over Rennie's death. Real old-fashioned men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The model of the crashing plane and the car accident must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Storytelling itself, in spite of flashback sequences, works directly - all storytellers trust us (regardless of the "truth" or "truth" of the dialogue), so there is no it is play with the viewer on the narrative structure. This would become an approximate model for future reviews, such as "Fearless". <br /> <br /> So all we have left is the individual performance, and at that level, it's better for Wynn's ban, a virtual Man Show.
