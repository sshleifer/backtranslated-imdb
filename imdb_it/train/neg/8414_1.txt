Yeah. Pretty sure you saw this movie years ago when you talked about the Supremes. Another recycled story glowed in Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from top films in the film production industry. <br /> <br /> Nothing original here. <br /> <br /> More makeup, glamorous costumes and choreography = more money for Beyonce's drawing, arguably "talented". <br /> <br /> If like the style of throwback, you should appreciate the real groups that fought (without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire). Beyonce's involvement makes this garbage hypocritical.
