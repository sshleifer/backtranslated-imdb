The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy cast list shouldn't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original satirical intent. Instead we get decidedly ugly sequences of songs and dance with picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is achieved by pulling back to reveal that the action took place on a music-hall stage, appropriately for a production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair from Brecht. The acting talent is shamefully abused: Migenes and Walters are good but they must not try very hard: Migenes has at least a great voice and a little tact for the material. Julia seems as perfect as Mack, but struggles with the character, wrapped in a fake leaden accent. Harris's Peachum is so embarrassing and Polly is atrocious. The adaptations of the lyrics, screenplays and music are often uncomfortable: it was a bad move to base the film on the Broadway version of Marc Blitzstein, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what was interpolated into loyalty gestures. And the attempt to overcome the low budget by filming in claustrophobic corners on sets wrapped in fog illuminated by bright blues and oranges as if Vittorio Storaro failed completely from a business deal - the film seems only cheap, poor and inconsiderate. Shameful.
