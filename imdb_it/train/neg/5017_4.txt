I just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and being a fan of Nick Stahl I just had to rent it. In all honesty, he probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was interesting and there were several pretty clever twists, but somehow I sensed almost everyone before they arrived. And the film went a little too far, in the end, in my opinion ... if I had to suffer to see it, you will see what I mean! <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good, but he always plays the same kind of character ... too Paul Finch of "American Pie" passing for my taste. <br /> <br /> And finally, the worst part of this film must be January Jones's emotionless performance ... I guess a pretty face is all that matters in Hollywood.
