Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors / producers in history. He was alone responsible for some of my favorite horror films of all time (such as Edgar Allen Poe's adaptations "Masque of the Red Death" and "Pit and the Pendulum"), as well as some annoying and annoying and annoying quickies (like " Creatures "from the Haunted Sea" and "She Gods of the Shark Reef"). Corman has also made a couple of films that are simply unclassifiable and simply "almost impossible to judge". "The Trip", for example , just as this imaginatively titled "Gas-sss" can somehow be labeled as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they are incredibly strange films influenced by the hippie culture. Half the time you don't have the slightest idea what's going on these characters walk back and forth across the screen and where the hell all this is going in. The plot is simple and yet very effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally released immediately cancel the world population of over 25 years. This * could * be the basic premise of a suspenseful atmosphere, gritty and disquieting post-apocalyptic science fiction landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a "trippy" movie comedy. None of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable imminent deaths; they celebrate only in the streets and find small juvenile criminal unions. "Gas-s-s-s" is a boring alibi and proves excessively difficult to be bizarre. The whole script seems to be improvised on the spot and not at all funny. It's definitely not my cup of tea, but the film has a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who am I to say it's not worth your time or money?
