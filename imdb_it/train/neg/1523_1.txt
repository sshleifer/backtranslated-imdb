This "movie" must be the biggest pile of steaming C * ^ p I've ever seen <br />, what else can I say about BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD. There is NOTHING to save this "movie" and I pray that they NEVER talk about doing a sequel. If you are thinking of looking at this, you should know that the plot is that two street sweepers are dragged to save the earth. Movies like Men in Black were torn to shreds and put back together to make this "Comedy", but they completely failed. Please avoid this movie, (save yourself).
