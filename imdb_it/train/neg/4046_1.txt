What an insult to the SA film industry! I've seen better SA movies. The comments I read in Hijack Stories, saying it's worth ten out of ten, are pretty scary. The evaluation of a film should not depend on .., "OH, A FILM FROM A COUNTRY IN DEVELOPMENT, IT IMPROVES THEIR INDUSTRY BY SAYING BEAUTIFUL THINGS ON THEIR WORK, EVEN IF IT IS BAD." We have the experience to make good movies. Don't judge the film industry by what people say about how great the Hijack Stories stories are. We can tell great stories like Cry the lovedoved Country and Shaka Zulu. Cry the beloved country. I will give 9 out of 10. Great direction by Darryl, great acting of two great elderly actors, regardless of where they are. Hijack Stories .., I will give 1 out of 10. It could only be the people involved in the project that would give them higher scores. I would have done the same if it was my film.
