I went into this with my hopes, within twenty minutes in the film I could not have been more disappointed. Although I thought this would be another terrible remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe ... just maybe someone would understand this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is on the same qualitative level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, exaggerated display of cheese and generally bad horror. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end it is boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye buns. We've seen it all before and we've seen it do a million times better than this. If you go to see the dance evening in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or the PPV), get ready to make the audience laugh, because they will laugh. The laughter is not in points in the film that should be fun, they are in response to the "thrilling" moments in the film that are made so bad that you seem to watch the new episode of Scary Movie. Seriously, did this have to be a remake or a parody? The filmmakers missed the mark so much that a large number of spectators in the theater I attended came out in the middle of the film. Which, in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me, however, I had to torture myself and keep it hoping it would improve. Needless to say, he didn't. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not so much for acting, but for directing, script, "special effects" and camera operation. The film manages to seem like they spent a fortune producing it, but it came out with a micro-budget movie. Halfway through, I expected to see the dollar store labels on some props and kept thinking of identifying a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /> <br /> This film is scary, if this is the future of the great horror of the budget, then the horror genre is doomed.
