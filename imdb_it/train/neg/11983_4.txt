Marie Dressler stars in this drama of the Depression era of a kind owner of the bank, which was broadcast recently on TCM during the month of the April Fools comedy. If you come with the expectation of great laughter, courtesy of the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed, as this is indeed a very negative film. It's also very badly done, surprisingly so considering that it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's naked-bone cinematography is closely linked to the "set the camera and don't move it" school, often to the detriment of the cast, which finds itself delivering lines off screen (it's like a panoramic print and scan before it existed!) or with the head cut off. The film does not even have an accredited director, based on the apparent nature of the production. Overall, this is an unsatisfactory disorder, with Dressler often over-emulating and only the bizarre, final run to reel in the bathroom to distinguish it.
