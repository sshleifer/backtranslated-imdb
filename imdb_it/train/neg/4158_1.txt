This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !!!! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I've never seen a movie worse than this !!! <br /> <br /> AND I NEVER EVER !!!! <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of "B" horror movies. As you can imagine ... I was exposed to some of the worst that the film industry can offer. <br /> <br /> I was drawn to this film for the title. I mean, come on ... what real horror fan wouldn't be fascinated by a title like "Vampires vs. Zombies" ??? The images of the "undead" who fought with the "undead" danced in my head. I thought to myself ... "this I have to see" !!!! <br /> <br /> Well ... I'm sorry to say ... "I wish I hadn't seen this" !!!!! <br /> <br /> The title of this film is misleading to say the least. There were no vampires fighting zombies. In reality, there is no plot !!!! If I were to ask myself what this film is about, I could honestly tell you that I have no idea !!! <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There was no story !!!! <br /> <br /> This film makes absolutely no sense !!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of this debacle ... I felt sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money in this project because they surely don't make sense for business !!!
