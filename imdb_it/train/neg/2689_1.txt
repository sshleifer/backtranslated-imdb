Now, I'm not a film critic, but I really hate "September 11th". This film was generally bad. With the exception of the segment of Alejandro González Iñárritu, which was the most effective and direct on the subject, the short films were at best boring, and at worst offensive. The worst thing in my mind was the pretentious segment of Youssef Chahine in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest that the suicide bombers were fighting for a bigger cause. The segment was completely out of the question and, considering Chahine's apparent lack of decency, a waste of time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a film with their opinions on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was insipid.
