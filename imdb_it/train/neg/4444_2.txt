Dr. K (David Hickey) tried to master a formula that would end all diseases and handicaps, but he needs living donors to complete his work. His brother doctor Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is accepted to medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is pre-law and plans to attend law school this fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah calls things off with her current boyfriend who is also fucking Ms. Walt (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his traitorous girlfriend's busty job). Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears to be in the throes of death when Dr. K suggests Richard to "recover" Eddie using his secret and illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie, horrible results occur. Eddie's face swells the massive warts while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can nurture this uncontrollable appetite that he cannot extinguish. Soon it could even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend. Eddie Monster must be stopped. <br /> <br /> The video horror film is terrible and suffers from a severe lack of budget, acting and general talent. The premise, which seems an interesting scare, fails to provide even a stroke of zombies. The gore is limited by some crunching scenes, but most of the violence happens outside the camera. Using time to move the story can really become annoying.
