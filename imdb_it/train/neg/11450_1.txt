I was able to see a preview of this film and I hope they have time to modify it in any way they can improve it before it comes out on August 3rd. It is played by Andy Samberg of Saturday Night Live as "Hot" Rod Kimble. He is a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stuntman like his dead father. When we meet him, he is jumping a mail truck on his mo-ped, yes, a mo-ped, and almost makes it. This would be worthy of a "Jackass" movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do it. Isla Fisher plays the girl next door, slightly older and much more mature, Denise. It seems that Rod has enough desire to join his "crew". Jorma Taccone (also SNL) plays the half brother Kevin, who documents the stunts with a video camera. Sissy Spacek plays Rod's mother, Marie. She remarried with Frank Powell, played by Ian McShane. Frank is a really tough guy who likes to beat Rod in some real fight. It is clear that Rod will not earn Frank's respect until he can beat him. We find out that Frank needs $ 50,000. heart transplant and Rod is determined to collect the money only to be able to "beat his donkey" once he is healed, and prove himself a man. A long fall along one side of the mountain convinces Rod to "grow up" on an acrobatics. Rod aims to get the initial money by loading to do stunts that would make you shiver if you saw them in real life. Like the human torch ... at a children's birthday party. There were those at the show who managed to laugh at most of the stunts. Just when all the hopes and money are lost, a sponsor arrives who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses that Rod wants to jump. You get exclusive transmission rights and set up phone lines to get donations. Rod gets a new dress and a real bike. The whole city is revealed and the world is tuned. Does he jump? Do you get the girl? Do they raise the $ 50k? Does Frank get Rod's ass pounded? Wait for this 90 minute movie to be released to find out.
