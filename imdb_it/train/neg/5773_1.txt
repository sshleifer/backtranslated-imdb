Another FINE effort by the most UNDERrated American director. His knowledge of racism is STAGGIOSA and I IMPRUDE him on more than one level. He accuses Lee of being in reality just a sneaky little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood's Affirmative Action system to make lower quality films, is absolutely NOT WANT, mere propaganda of the Right. The idea that Lee would have used the current climate of political correctness in America to produce hate-free anti-white films is simply FALSE and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some detractors of Lee also come so far as to suggest that GOTB glorifies African-Americans while putting down other races: obviously, another FALSEHOOD spread by people who are opposed to peaceful coexistence between different races in America and elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the film is a long dialogue between the rich Republican black and the others on the bus. The opinions presented by that man are simply WRONG - all across the board. 100% UNTRUE. MISS education, unlike the cleverly INFORMED guys who throw it on the bus in a MERITIVE way. <br /> <br /> TERRIFIC performance and an INTELLIGENT screenplay create a visual experience that has been RARELY competitive with any political film made since. <br /> <br /> I also want to emphasize the incessant LIES that the Million-Man March had only 80,000 people taking part! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words written in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what message does Lee send here? If someone disagrees with your political opinions, you simply need to apply the violence and knock it off the bus. I thought the movie said "get on the bus" ...? <br /> <br /> Apparently, Mr. Lee is for the segregation of buses after all, meaning he is no different from those crazy KKK before him: the bus is only for those blacks who are in line with the line of thought of the Democratic Party. Just to "free the slaves" ... <br /> <br /> The end credits: "This film was entirely financed by blacks." It is distributed and marketed by a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites that Farrakhan despises ...
