This film is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I don't say it in a positive sense. We wanted to see a lousy horror / thriller, so we chose what looked like the shop's most beloved. For once, the film was all we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors seem to be reading their posters from behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by putting transparent transparent plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are seeing through the eyes of murderous mice. And the script? I didn't even start writing on the script ... And just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it turned out that the first part of the film was Oscar-winning material compared to the finale. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, this movie is fun if you like horror movies, but if you want a GOOD movie, keep looking. This is not for you.
