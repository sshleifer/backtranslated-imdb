This really should have been a single star, but there were so many cliches, predictable twists, given everything before the quick parallels I gave him one more star for the fact that it made me laugh ... even though this was never the intentioned directors I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I don't often write comments on films, they must be either sensational, or in this case really bad. <br /> <br /> To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey, I knew he would be poor because he has a unique nose to choose the worst movies. <br /> <br /> Somehow the farce of it all made me see everything through, perhaps because of the hilarious voice of MR T, (don't broadcast Mr. T, but you'll know what I mean if you care to watch this) , if you look at it, make sure you don't pay to see it. This might have worked if they had staged the play, but I'm sure you'll find the strange laughter here and there at the farce of all this ...
