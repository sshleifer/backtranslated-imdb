Oh, CGI. A blessing if used correctly. A pity with it is used by people who have no idea what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is misused in this latest Jaws scam. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyone who has read any number of my published reviews has probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low-budget horror movies. E 2: If there is a nice guy in a low budget movie, I will usually point them out. So, let's get him out of here now. This is a low budget horror film that I didn't like. The acting, for the most part, is horrible, laughable, and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I've ever seen this year. As for the cute resident boy ... Dax Miller (Bog) wins the prize in low hands. This guy is sexy! And surprisingly, it's not just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a nice ass ... it can really act (well, as much as it can in this hateful movie). Now that we have the cleaning tasks out of the way, let's move on. <br /> <br /> In the version of Cliff Notes, here's the story (don't worry, I'll try not to give anything away) ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island for shoot a documentary about two surfers (a cute boy and a friend of his) surfing with sharks. Unknown to them is a large saltwater crocodile lurking around the island. Croc shows up, chaos follows and people are eaten. Roll end credits. <br /> <br /> As I said before, this movie is a lot of shots. It started pretty well, but soon it became silly and stupid. A main character becomes lunch (in a rather humorous way), and our remaining hero gives a spasm at the victim's expense. Also, if this croc is at the top of the food chain both on land and in water, what's around with all the sharks? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I don't think some skinny sharks would stop around. FX is among the worst I've ever had the displeasure of seeing. CGI is horrendous and they even managed to ruin the animatronic crocs. Attention, directors. National Geographic. Discovery Store. The Croc Hunter. They know what crocodiles are. Obviously you did not refer to any of these to judge by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film. And what happens to the gang of drug dealers / pirates? Do you just need another reason to snatch a woman's top? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small subgenres in the world of cinema. With Alligator and its sequels, Lake Placid, Crocodile and now Blood Surf, it now appears that "over-sized crocodile / alligator" movies should now have their blockbuster category. The alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I also thought the Tobe Hooper crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My vote: D-
