Reasons to watch the movie: <br /> <br /> 1) Bo Derek looks good at 16 and sometimes he remains naked. He does a good job interpreting an immature and insecure beauty of 16 years, in fact <br /> <br /> 2) Many shots of a fairly Greek island <br /> <br /> But: <br /> <br / > 1) Peter Hooten turns into an actor's worst performance since Brutus played Caeser's friend in "Processes of the Roman Senate on March 15th". Deliver each line in a delicious baritone bellow. Turn down the volume every time you talk. Preferably all the way through <br /> <br /> 2) Bo's fantasies are sadly domesticated, especially by today's standards. Some laps in the bathtub and as a fully dressed model <br /> <br /> 3) The plot is thinner than Bo's costumes
