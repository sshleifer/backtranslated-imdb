As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely offensive and humiliating for single women over 40, not to mention any other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a "chicken movie", and he failed miserably. Andy McDowell is not so much an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent "plot" (I hate even referring to it as a plot) in this, he didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy / empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film realistic or credible. And then there's the obligatory male fantasy of a heterosexual woman who suddenly decides to try lesbianism - PLEASE. <br /> <br /> Not only would I like to get my DVD rental money back, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back. What a rip-off.
