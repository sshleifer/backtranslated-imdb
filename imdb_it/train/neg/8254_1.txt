I saw a better production quality on YouTube! Too bad for the actors, since the script was awful and the direction shocking, I'm not sure how they could get the jokes - I really doubt any actor would have been able to save this movie, no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot that seemed to go nowhere. It's a real shame, since the premise for the film was good and with better quality, directing and script could have been a decent film. Certainly it was not a comedy, unless he laughed out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.
