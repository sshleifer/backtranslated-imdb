The only reason I remember this film is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money spent. I was 17 and my friend was 18 years old. We had the age where action movies were the thing we liked the most (ok, the second plus). We came out feeling so insulted, we wanted our money back, but time could never be regained. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. As the truck is attacked by an increasing number of vehicles with rocket launchers attached, the film completely insults the public's intelligence by presenting these thugs in 4x4 VW Bugs firing rockets into the truck. Please, the rockets on a truck known to transport plutonium? What's worse is that these VWs manage to get 15-18 shots of a 4 rocket launcher. You will see on VW with 4 missiles shoot 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last one attached, come back a second later with two rockets attacked, shoot another, then go in front of the truck and now it's full set of 4 rockets again. <br /> <br /> We resisted hoping for a grand finale that never happened. Looks like they just ran out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Simply ridiculous.
