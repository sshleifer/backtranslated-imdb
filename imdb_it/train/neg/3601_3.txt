Was she foretelling when Tori complained that her first boyfriend treated her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the killer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think so. Scenes to make you scream with joy: abundant montages, a strip-tease in kimono (what do you call it when you wear your clothes seductively instead of taking them off?), And a ski battle! Sure sure for the beginning and the end, but you can take a sandwich during the second act when the whole plot is happening. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Nah. Does Tori ever get to heaven or even out of the snow? No.
