The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' many times. Yet somehow, the interesting plot lines end up being unexplained or ignored, as if they never happened. The protagonist was irritating throughout the film and at one point my friend and I shouted that we wanted him to die. There are some really spooky / scary moments, but these are seriously obscured by the moments that have just bothered me. It's another one of those horror movies that surfaces and intrigues you for a while, but in the end it leaves you frustrated and a bit confused about what filmmakers were trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves the film is the villain, but when the villain is nicer than the protagonist, you know you're a loser.
