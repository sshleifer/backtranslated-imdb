I went to see "Evening" because of the cast. I went to see "Norman's Room" for that reason - that movie that offered Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and, also, Meryl Streep - and I loved every minute of it. The same goes for "The Notebook", even though it was a lollipop. And my feeling was that whatever offered the performances of Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would have been at least as good. Instead, I have sometimes discovered that even the greatest actors cannot overcome the trivial, simplistic and - on one occasion - truly offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problems with the way the film was structured. Actually I like films that go back and forth in time to tell a story ... as long as one era illuminates the other and the opposite. But while Vanessa's character was on her deathbed and remembered a past event, she felt that "it was a mistake" was compelling, sometimes the part that actually showed what "past error" did nothing to clarify the issue. In fact, it makes it seem insignificant in the silliest "girl meets boy, girl becomes boy, girl loses fashion", and in the most incredible, cliché, wrong, possible way. <br /> <br /> And here's the spoilers, so keep that in mind and keep reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danes was brutally misplaced. Not only did she not even start to look like Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she never saw the ribs when it comes to acting. Don't get me wrong, she can be good in the right role - not just that. And Patrick Wilson was a mixed bag, even though he has acting ribs almost to make it. It would have been better suited to the part played by Hugh Dancy - the rich confused WASP - and not the object of sexual attraction for all; it's a bit too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? One note: "I'm a tortured drunk and I'm waiting to find out why." And the "why" (I'm a closed case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink in excess and make fun of myself in front of everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died (like you knew he would do it because it's the only thing that can happen to a fag in the fifties) so ridiculous, rude and abused, I almost threw the candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's "perfect life", her sister wonders if she made the right choices, her pregnancy and her boyfriend too perfect (which actually may have been more interesting and meaningful when played by Patrick Wilson, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach may have been a more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) - anyway, all this was crushed in the 70s and 80s. And in a much greater depth. Will we really have to present it, once again, and everything as if it were fresh and important? <br /> <br /> And finally, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie, all in the old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but only because she is Meryl, and Meryl manages to find a way to bring out even the most stupid dialogue under the heaviest make-up. <br /> <br /> So, to put it simply, this film has all the clichés in "The movie of the message really meaningful", and adds some that actually hadn't yet trotted any business, again. With a duration of two hours and "Lifetime Movie-of-the-week" music that guarantees you a raw sound, it is a complete failure in both "significant" and "cinematographic" aspects. I give him "3" only for Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all you need from your movies is twadd, then please set my comments on "Evening" aside and take the time of your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience to be served by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the absurdities that come from it, rent "Norman's Room" and find out what a great acting really is .
