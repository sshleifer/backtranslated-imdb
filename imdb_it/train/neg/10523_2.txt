For the first forty minutes, Empire really has formed: it looks like a strong, confident and relatively unknown gangster movie. At the time I didn't know why, I thought it was nice, but now I do it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and absolutely disgusting. I don't care about movies with psychopaths and things, to prove a point - for example, Jackie Brown - but they're all so terribly superficial in this, but this is obviously thrown for entertainment. You literally feel a knot in your stomach. Another important problem is the protagonist. He's smug, arrogant, yet - ironically - not so bad. He doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug killer. The fact is that, in the end, this film is completely pretentious. Not smooth, not intelligent, just boring and insignificant, this colossal chaos should be avoided at all costs. <br /> <br /> * on ***** (1 of 5)
