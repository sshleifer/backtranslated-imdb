The moment you offer a 1/10 art movie, you have people bombarding you with your ignorant, half-stuck and artistically delayed blood. I will not try to justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing all the "arthouse cinema" that I liked or mentioning as I gave a "classic cult" unknown to 10/10. All I ask is that someone explain to me the point, the purpose and the message of this film. <br /> <br /> This is how I would like to summarize the film: the opening of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of incidence. Followed by (in a nutshell, to save yourself 3 hours of pain) the following: A guest of games for children who dies of lung cancer tries to fix things with his drug-addicted daughter, who may or may not have raped when she was a child, and who has been courted by a clumsy policeman with relationship problems, while the star of the game-show decides that he does not want to be a failed child prodigy, a fate that has fallen into another episode of the competing game of the years 60, which we see now is an unemployed homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for 'corrective oral surgery', while the game's producer, dying of lung cancer, asks his nurse to help reconciles with the son who he abandoned years ago and later became a self-taught guru of himself, even though the producer's second wife suffered from guilt over cheating a man dying; and oh, in the end it rains the frogs (you read that right). And I'm saving you the incredibly long and useless monologues, literally inconclusive that every character seems to emerge on the fly for no rhyme or reason if not, perhaps, to make sure that the film goes through 3 hours and becomes classified as a 'modern epic'. <br /> <br /> You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the film (and, in turn, not confusing yourself) if I had written that damn thing a little more coherently, perhaps in a few sentences instead of just one ... Well, now you know how I feel.
