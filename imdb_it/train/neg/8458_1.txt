I bought this movie last weekend in my local movie gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more, so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box says it would be a really nice movie. Well, it starts like it's a great movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The film is about a young woman, Laila, who is killed trying to save her boyfriend, Jack, from a bull. Laila's father, Cordobes, is a breeder whose citizens are afraid. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because he feared that he feared this bull and went hunting to find him. This was the first 5 minutes which is good. What follows after will be only 100 times worse. Anyone who wrote the script, in my opinion, had to make an acid trip or something, because nothing else made sense what ever. Jack is on the run and finds this touring radio DJ named Mary giving him a ride. I think Mary should be a virgin Mary character. You know, the mother of Jesus. But, who knows, I could not do my head or cross. While they are running ... we can see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc ... And all these things are done so that your brain hurts trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I filmed it and traded it for something else. It's horrible, I tell you, it's horrible. And there is absolutely no fight against bullying in this film. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. I hope I have helped some other people not to waste time on this film.
