What were they thinking about "Cannes"? One of the most irritating films of all time. Every detail of this film, regardless of how meaningless it has been shown. If I had to see her wearing boots again I think I would have screamed. If the point of this film was to show how pathetic a Rosetta life was, then it was covered in the first fifteen minutes of the film and therefore the credits should have been running. But no, we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over again. The whole thing was full of unpleasant and insensitive characters. They deserved the misery that was Rosetta. And to think that I gave up "Tumbleweeds" to see this over-hyped film of boredom. It was like watching the grass grow, only it's more exciting.
