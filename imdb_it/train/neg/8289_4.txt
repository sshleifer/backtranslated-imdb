I'm sorry, but this is such a bad movie, it's fun. Soccer hooligans arguing in a travel lodge? Suits? Shades?! Alan clearly had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, it is as far away from the truth as possible. <br /> <br /> The casting was atrocious ... Gary Oldman like a football hooligan? It does not seem scary, it is scary or even comes across someone who would like football. And what about the Yeti? What the hell? Clothes, shades and seats in a travelodge that jokingly take each other with "it's almost time you have a diaper". Please. <br /> <br /> And the Yeti band spraying ICC underwear? <br /> <br /> I don't see how anyone can take this movie seriously! <br /> <br /> 4/10. It is perhaps the most inaccurate portrait of the crisis of the 80s that he has ever seen before hooliganism.
