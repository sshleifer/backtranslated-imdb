A flat and ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those who, apparently, love to increase her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the adorable Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) introduces himself as a resident surgeon, the problems are not far off. <br /> <br /> The script fails in the sense that it does not carefully develop the promising premise in an effective and attractive thriller and the serious lack of motivation, background and development of the character leave the field to the achievement of the entire show. None of the cast is able to arouse interest in their superficial characters, particularly Bill Pullman, whose inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe. <br /> <br /> Poor director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project, and he can't do entertainment from any of them. The moment the "secret" of the plot is revealed, it doesn't matter to you. <br /> <br /> At least the cinematography has a good Massachusetts appearance. Also present are George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer. <br /> <br /> Sunday, February 25, 1996 - T.V.
