I believe in keeping religion out of the government and out of the cinema. When I want a sermon, I go to church, but I don't want one from a movie. I don't care about some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is almost as supernatural as it can get!) But this movie made me so much preach that I was really annoyed. The landlady reminded me of the witches you saw in other films. The villain also seemed to have horns. <br /> <br /> And what a foolish end: the hero went to the meeting and shouted to all those old men, and this broke the spell. If only life was so simple. I think when the movies are so stupid, they should be distributed with a warning: DANGER! PREDICATE HERE CONTENT!
