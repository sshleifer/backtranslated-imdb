The main aspect of the Superstar films in the later stages were frequency, the gap between one film and another. Being an established star in southern India, the feedback she was receiving before Baba was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of films he starred in Tamil as a mass hero in 11 years was only 11 at exactly the rate of 1 per year. All of these have been a great success. He was having an image that many thoughts could not be easily killed. <br /> <br /> But after Padayappa (1999), he entered a state of hibernation. His fans around the world, especially in southern India, were ready to watch movies of all kinds with their superstar in action. Therefore, the Tamil film industry has decided to come with Baba. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers thought that the fans will bring with them what they show with Superstar. But this clearly did not work in this film. As usual, the media hype and fan expectations were far beyond the limit. <br /> <br /> The image of Rajinikanth has been completely damaged. The fans went crazy. The film's collection has not reached the expected level. The reputation of great people has gone down. <br /> <br /> The only positive aspect of this film is the songs of A.R.Rehman. Rehman is known to have composed good music for some of the worst films such as Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu, etc. I never thought this movie would become part of that championship. > <br /> You will feel very depressed not because the film is bad, it will be because the image of the superstar is going down. It took five years to recapture it completely with two films, Chandramukhi and Sivaji, and give the fans back what they really are looking for in a superstar movie.
