Hood of the living Dead is about a young scientist named Rick who lives with his brother in the Oklahoma city where drug traffickers and prostitutes fill the streets. Then, one night, Rick's brother was hit by a gang that traveled the road he fought with him first. Desperate, Rick calls his scientific partner to carry out the last formula they are working on that brings sick blood cells to health. The formula has not been tested on a human body, or even on a corpse, but Rick is determined to bring his brother back to life. It gives the body a double dose of the formula, but nothing happens. So Rick calls 911 and the body is taken away only to come back to life and quay on human flesh. Now Rick has to find his zombie brother before the entire hood turns into a neighborhood of the dead. Hood of the living Dead is a piece of trash. The plot is a direct rip-off of Resident Evil, the acting is simply horrible, especially with Rick's false cry for his brother, the guns are so fake because every time the gun is fired it sends sparks and the trick is just boring. It's just a fake blood covered by the actors' faces. Even the zombies are modified. They run, growl and must be killed in the heart to die! Zombies should just fight, moan and have to be killed in the brain to die! This film is so horrible, the outtakes are the only real positive moment of this film. Hood of the Living Dead gets a 3 out of 10, a bit of entertainment here and there, but it only succeeds as a low budget party.
