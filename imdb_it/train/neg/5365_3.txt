"Private Practice" has been transformed into "Grey's Anatomy", quite successful and well written. The cast is fabulous. The premise could also work. But writing is simply terrible. <br /> <br /> The pre-pilot disguised as an episode of Grey's Anatomy should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a stroke of luck. So I set the DVR to record the pilot and all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> As I watched the pilot, I kept wondering how a show with such a prestigious cast could put together a boring driver. The pilot should suck people and keep them from coming back for more. There should be excitement, flash, good script, intriguing plot with a cliffhanger that has to be fulfilled for the rest of the season. Surprisingly, this show had none of this. <br /> <br /> Thinking that it was a stroke of luck, I just saw the second episode hoping for the best. And although marginally better, it does not come close to what should be interesting, it cannot miss the TV. <br /> <br /> I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. It's not worth it, IMO, and I'd be very surprised if this show came until mid-season. These people pass.
