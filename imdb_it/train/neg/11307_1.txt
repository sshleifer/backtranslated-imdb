The perfectly stupid weapon. I think the guys who danced at the beginning of one of the Steven Segal films were intent on teasing Jeff who was making his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie. The plot is predictable, the fights were right and Jeff behaves as well as the couch with which he beats a kind of weapon in a scene.
