This was a film about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the "twin" connection feels that something is wrong with her sister. This film took an eternity to establish the plot. A plot that has been made many times. The acting was mostly disgusting. Once the plot approaches, the film ends. Laura and Ashley are twins living with a violent father. The father seems to prefer Ashley, so Laura is to blame for everything. There is a promise made that the girls would never have been separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley finds a job at a diner where she meets Barry, a married man. Obviously nothing good can come from this. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was not a good excuse to find a way to track him down. I kept waiting for this movie to improve and for some solution somewhere, but it never happened.
