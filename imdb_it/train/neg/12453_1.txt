I had always been a big fan of Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman, so when the Sci-Fi Channel shot this film, I had to see it. I was bitter. This is a Wonder Woman movie by name only. He does not wear the right costume [he must have refused or ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a poor James Bond. There is none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success, namely superhuman strength or determined will. It's just a long bad dream. I don't even think that Cathy is so attractive. I would not waste time with this.
