"Respect for Acting" by Uta Hagen is the standard textbook in many university theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the Presentational approach and the Representational approach. In the Presentational approach, the actor focuses on the realization of the character in the most honest way possible, introducing emotional elements of the actor's life itself. In the Representational approach, the actor tries to present the effect of an emotion, through a high degree of control of movement and sound. <br /> <br /> The representational approach to acting was still partially in place when this Hamlet was created. English theater has a long history of this style of acting, and one could say that Olivier is the supreme king of the representation school. <br /> <br /> Time has not been kind to this acting school or this movie. Almost all the actors working today use a Presentational approach. For the modern eye, Olivier's stylized and highly enunciated delivery is heavy, stiff and pungent. Instead of creating an internally conflicting Hamlet, Olivier made a reciting and self-important megaphone out of the melancholy Dane - a style of acting that would carry well behind London's biggest theaters, but is too verbose to complete a Modern Hamlet. <br /> <br /> And so the movie creaks unpleasantly today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally funny: "On the contrary, you have to buy and be-get a noise that can give him ... Smooth-ness!" Instead of crying to meet his father's ghost (like any suitable actor), the bright lights in Olivier's pupils give us that impression. Eileen Herlie is the only other actor of note in this Hamlet, who inserts a good essay to the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (she was 41, she was 26). The other actors in this film have no chance of getting anything meaningful, given Olivier's tendency to want to keep! the camera! on him! at all! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, we feel the insecurity of the Shakespearean theatrical actor who did not have the security to portray a fragile and imperfect Hamlet and instead was chosen to represent a kind of Elizabethan megaphone. Final analysis: "I would like such an individual to have himself whipped for the Termagant oeroso, but Herod: pray, avoid".
