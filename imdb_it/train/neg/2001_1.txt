Why were there so many people flocking to an evening showing "Up Against Them" by Roberto Moreira ("Contra Todos") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "This is a hit man," my friend said. "Well ... and he's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical climate, lush rhythms and a plot of fashionable gangsters? There is no doubt that there are ample seductions. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us a little detail: this is a very ugly film, really quite horrible, and unpleasant to watch since it is badly done. <br /> <br /> So why did "Contra Todos" go around Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, numerous small local festivals and now San Francisco? Apparently, due to the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work. <br /> <br /> First of all, he won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where he was called the best Brazilian film of the year. It must have been a bad year; they had much, much better ones. Subsequently, synopsis of synopsis in the most imaginary buzz catalogs lead to crowded auditoriums and - since the film is not present anywhere and therefore avoids careful scrutiny by critics - it continues to go around. <br /> <br /> Festival blurbs targeted sometimes the promotion does it often. A Chicago festival called "Contra Todos" "a speedball cocktail pulled out of Brazil" and referred to Claudia's boyfriend as the "pivot of the slum district". Soninha is "Teodoro's daughter, a nymph of adolescent age, in which sexuality grows". The film is "shot with the urgency of a camera frequently held in the hand" and the director "develops a genuine and palpable sense of frustration born of domestic despair and decadence". The effect is "unbearably raw and honest", and the film darts "towards a finished conclusion like the exposed lives". It's not the best writing, but it certainly stimulates excitement for a certain type of potential spectator. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" concerns a hit man, two hit men, a wife and a daughter and a reborn Christian girlfriend. It is shot - in a terribly ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera - mostly in a poor, barren-looking suburb rather than in one of the fabulous "favelas" or Brazilian slums of villages where wonderful films like "Black Orpheus" , "Pixote" and "City of God" were made, and not in Rio this time, but in Sao Paulo. <br /> <br /> The killer with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner in a drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a small television experience, as well as the actress who plays the squalid blonde wife of Teodoro, Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço, who plays the sullen daughter ready for the Soninha uprising. These actors could cross the back corners of some telenovelas. Who knows? - in a better direct movie they could also be good. Apart from them, there are some young people who are chased away by Teordoro or, when occupied, by gangs of thugs. Presidents do not have much presence, even if the camera enlarges their pores. <br /> <br /> A couple of observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one in London, saw the deficiencies of this film, but unfortunately I am "re-buried in the hinterland of the Web. Henry Sheehan noticed from Berlin that the "film" (his quotes) was "the worst video work" shown. "The director seems to have chosen the video simply because it was a cheap alternative to the film," wrote Sheehan, "and made no use creative of the new medium "- nor, he adds, did any other creative thing. /> <br /> Sheehan underlined the film's first big mistake:" it starts as a domestic drama that should increase when, half an hour from the action, Moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professionally affected men, waiting for thirty minutes adds nothing to the film, it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is, at least, a waste of time, but creating one is all that that Moreira always does, like a child who has a tool kit p for his birthday, and he goes around slamming everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill. "Devastating, but true. <br /> <br /> Writing about the London festival for Kamera.com in 2004, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side, but he still gave up the lack of positive features in calling the performances" the film is easily a better feature. "Yes, very easily, since everything else is so ugly. Alsanjak has admitted that" this low-budget, violent and squalid account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is devoid of friendly characters and, of consequently, of hope. Too obscure and cynical to be a telling story of the human condition, the film is not helped by the poor subtitling ... "The Alsanjak district, Contra Todos, a" Dogme "and Mike Leigh did not help the thing. <br /> <br /> Apart from the first half-hour without meaning in which nothing redeems the boredom of our expectation for the first acts of violence - which, when they arrive, are simply "slamming everything in sight without rhyme, reason or ability" - Moreira he clumsily tries to redeem his brusque ending by adding what appears to come out immediately afterwards, followed by a final plausible ironic scene in which one of the characters marries, no doubt the director wanted to show the "banality of evil" of the hired assassins low-level in working-class neighborhoods, but cannot make the characters, which he sees generically, come alive for us, and the film's structure shows that he too cannot change his material. <br /> <br /> (Seen at Sa n Francisco International Film Festival April 28, 2005.)
