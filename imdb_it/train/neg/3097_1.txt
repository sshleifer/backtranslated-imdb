There can be no question of spoilers for this film, the director beat us all and ruined this film in so many ways. <br /> <br /> A blatant rip-off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins, this film fails on so many levels to regain the humor and horror of those better made movies. He ends up wasting time, in which bad actors create a bad dialogue in front of an idiotic director, who occasionally launches them stuffed toys. They fight with the aforementioned toys in much the same way as the old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles, shaking them as they screamed and doing their best to make it look slightly threatening. It's painful to watch, and not helped by the 80's mental fashions worn by the cast. <br /> <br /> Basically, some crazy little aliens who were trapped by an old security guard in a batch of films finally get free after a thousand years of confinement, and begin to telepathically envelop with people's minds. The new recruit of guards, the idiot who left them out despite repeated warnings, brings his gang of friends from the 80s together and they leave together and have minor adventures together as they try to regain the Grem ... Hobgoblin. <br /> <br /> All life is here, with the band made up of a jockey, the girlfriend of the 80s, the girlfriend of a frigid and sissy hero, and the young hero, lacking in confidence and eager for his girlfriend eliminated him anyway. <br /> <br /> First comes the infamous rake fighting scene, in which the former military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully, hitting the nerd hero with the wrong side of a rake for what looks like hours. Then there is someone running around, ending in a real pie-style fighting that ends in a dreamy nightclub with comic hand grenades that blow up everything but the people right next to them. Then the film closes abnormally, and all in all it's fine. <br /> <br /> It is not. It's like watching a train wreck, you can't look away from it, it's so ugly. Perfect dishes for the Mystery Science Theater, but god-terrible you should try looking at it yourself and without cuts. The fashion police still have a number of exceptional mandates for the cast, and I challenge anyone not to laugh in open mockery at the rake fight. This score is 2 out of 10 at the most, on a good day.
