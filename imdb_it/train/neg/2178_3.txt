I would have enjoyed this movie a little more than it was for Jason (Herb) Evers constant insisting on the experiment. Many of the early reviewers of The Seven Samurai have accused Toshiro Mifune of making a mistake. Yet, as more and more critics saw that film, they saw it being done intentionally. Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his exaggeration is exactly that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this classic B were rather good actors, less Evers and showgirls. If you watch this movie, you would have noticed that Evers screamed almost every line, that is, until he smokes and blows smoke from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were par for the course in a B movie like this. In hindsight, there isn't much that stands out in my mind as fantastically good or bad for this movie.
