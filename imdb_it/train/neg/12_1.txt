All I could think of while watching this movie was the B-grade slop. Many have talked about the fact that the quality of redemption is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a state of self-perpetuation of unfortunate events. Yet, in reality, the techniques used (as many have already said) were too exploited and therefore unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, he was lackluster, unimaginative, implausible and twisted. You can read most of the other reports on this film and they will say pretty much how I would do it. <br /> <br /> Some actors and actresses are attracted, but in the face of such a boring action ... the appearance can only bring a film so far. The action is scarce and intermittent: some punches thrown here and there and a final firefight towards the end. Nothing really to write home. <br /> <br /> As others have already said, the "BAD" films are fantastic to watch because they are "bad", you are delighted with this fact. This film, however, is a void. Furthermore, if one really needs an educational film to scare people away from drug use, I would seriously recommend any number of other films out there that address those problems in another much more effective way. 'Requiem For A Dream', 'Trainspotting', 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' and 'Candy' are just a few examples. Although you should also watch some more carefree movies on the same topic like 'Go' (in general, both serious and funny) and 'Halfbaked'. <br /> <br /> On a final note, the one that could redeem the line in this film, delivered by Vinnie Jones, was stolen from "Lock, Stock and Two Smokling Barrels". To think that some of that great film has been contaminated by 'Loaded' is vile. <br /> <br /> In general, I strongly suggest you save money and time by NOT watching this movie.
