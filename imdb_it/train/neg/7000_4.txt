Hollywood, the home of clamor, glamor and the search for profits, is barely governed by spiritual values, and so it is not surprising that his attempts at investigating spiritual life are subtle and often foolish (better to go further) to the films of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to probe the depictions of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This strange hybrid of adventure films, a love story and a religious parable trivializes the insights it seeks to communicate. That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Verne (Clark Gable in the most polite and self-righteous manner) and Julie (Joan Crawford, who growls and spits every other word in an attempt to be the Queen of the Dough Tough) seems ridiculous at best. Is this the Patron Saint of the Star System at work, who combines the struggling egos before sending them to further penal servitude on the M-G-M lot? BUT. . there are good support performances here, and visually interesting moments: the dark prison barracks; the boat escaping in the moonlight or against a pictorial cloudscape; Julie walks along the waterfront while the wind whips; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiate for Verne's freedom as the storm builds up; an unusually ennobling gay love story between two prisoners. . Above all, there is the dignified and detached performance of Paul Lukas as Hessler, a murderer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambreau, yet turns his back on him. In the most exciting moment of the film, Hessler, having left Cambreau, is outside the cabin. We feel the wind through the jungle, we see the shadows on his face, which convey a moment of fear and insecurity. Then he goes out into the night. At this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential strength that none of the other characters can achieve. Is the secret of the film that its deepest condolences have allied itself with Hessler?
