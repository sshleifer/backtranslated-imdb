JUST CAUSE showcases Sean Connery as Harvard law professor, Kate Capshaw (continues to work?) As his wife (slight age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern policeman (!) And Ed Harris in a total surrender above the lines of a fundamentalist of the serial killer of the south. <br /> <br /> Casting is strange, but the film plays a serious mindf ** with the audience. (don't read if you ever intend to seriously watch this movie or watch this movie seriously because of spoilers) First of all, I felt my eyes move repeatedly on liberal stereotypes: the cops are all sadistic and frame this black guy without proof . The coroner, witnesses and even the defendant's lawyer collaborate against him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. <br /> <br /> Connery is a Harvard law professor who gets into talk about injustices against blacks and the barbaric death penalty. He is approached by the convict's grandmother to defend him and reopen the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is silenced (yawning ...) by the little city officials and the good IL boys' club, but finds the case against Blair, the alleged murderer, now in the arm of the death, it was all invented. The main proof was his confession that was defeated by him. <br /> <br /> The beating was administered by a black cop (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the confession from him. Connery discovers that another death row inmate has actually committed the murder and after a few years a tea with a Hannibal Lecter-type Ed Harris, who has seriously exaggerated, finds out where Harris hid the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> Gets a new trial and Blair is released. <br /> <br /> I think ... the movie ends ... <br /> <br /> Then suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psychopath and used "white guilt" to enlist Connery. He invented the story with Ed Harris in exchange for the fact that Blair committed some murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Now Blair is free again, thanks to the disappointing principles of Connery's PC! The last 30 minutes. are a strange action movie stuck on a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne fight the serial killer in a house of alligator skins on stilts (yes, you read that right) in the everglades. <br /> <br /> That was a strange film. <br /> <br /> So the whole system is corrupt and inefficient, the cops are all Abu Burib-type bullies and torturers, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to fry. <br /> <br /> Really depressing at every level! The system is completely rotten and even the types of guilt of the white PC that challenge it are seriously disappointed. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Obviously Connery had to pay a mortgage or something.
