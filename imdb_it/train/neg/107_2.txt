If the crew of "Zombie Chronicles" read it, here are some tips for kids: <br /> <br /> 1. In a "Twist Ending" movie, it's not a good idea to include close-ups of EVERY DEATH IN THE FILM in opening credits. This tends to ruin the turns, you know ...? <br /> <br /> 2. I know you produced it with little money and, to be honest, you did miracles with your budget, but please hire people who can actually take action. Or at least, walk, talk and manage at the same time. Joe Haggerty, I'm watching you ... <br /> <br /> 3. If you're planning to set up a part of your film in the past, do it only if you have the props and costumes of the era. <br /> <br /> 4. Twist's conclusions should be a surprise. Of course, we don't want twists that don't make sense, but mark the "revelation" as soon as we introduce a character? It's not a great idea. Congratulations to the boys for having tried, but in all honesty, I would prefer not to have them ... <br /> <br /> Only for zombie completists.
