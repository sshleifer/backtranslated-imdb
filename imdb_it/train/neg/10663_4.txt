The film was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between. But the cast of women gave a pretty good show compared to the males who were ridiculous. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really got excited about the film. His voice was so seductive and sexy. The scenes on the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than anyone could do. he really is one of the best in these roles. He also played fairly well as the villain in the last 5 minutes, which is the interesting part of the film. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not so good and this was not the best as an action star. He could have chosen a better script than this one. I really think he did it for money.
