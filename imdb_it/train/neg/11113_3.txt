I often feel like Scrooge, banging movies that others are excited about - or, I write the review to balance the unwarranted raves. I found this film almost unwatchable and, unusual for me, it was a fast progress not only through boring dialogue, with clich√©s, but also with boring and trivial musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film - the unusual domestic setting for a musical, a lot of imagination, some animation - it is more than compensated by a script that doesn't have an ounce of spirit or stimulating plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey seem to be nice people, but they can't bring a film as a team. Nor is he really charismatic or has much sexual appeal. They are both insipid. I like Billy Gray, but his character is a beautiful piece. The best part of the film, to me, is June Haver's splendid costumes and body.
