I can understand why Laurel and Hardy's purists might be offended by this rather gentle 're-enactment', but this film would be an excellent way to introduce children to the pleasures of classical L & H. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain reasonably acquit themselves as the duo comedian and there is a decent supporting cast. I liked it.
