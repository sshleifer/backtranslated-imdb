It could be said that the actors will make a film, but this clearly shows that this statement is wrong. Most of the characters in this film have nothing to hold onto. They play the part of cardboard scraps moved in predictable and uninteresting ways. The story is very simple. It could be summed up in a few words, but I'll keep it in case someone reads wanted to see this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to speed up the parts where Jack showed us how to be an obnoxious eater. I must say that 70% of this film revolves around cooking, eating or preparing to eat. Frankly, I'd rather not spend time watching Jack chew loudly with his mouth open. Personally, I could have done without the references and the jokes about the shoes that hit the first half of the film. <br /> <br /> Outside of my personal dementia, the film really lacked something worthwhile. There were countless scenes and shots that seemed to drag. When something happens, the characters' reactions are vague and dry. <br /> <br /> Better not look at this.
