OK, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi) has produced a horrendous mixture of a Mr. Carl Macek. <br /> <br /> What is this horrible mixture I'm talking about? Well, Macek has taken three completely independent Japanese science fiction series (ie Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS of dialogue - firmly believing that the American public is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - all in all heavily for violent content, added a metaphysical mumbo jumbo, nicknamed using some of the worst voice actors on this side of the hell of acting (Reba West's singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to Ms. Mari Iijima) ... And the result was a series of 85 episodes with hundreds of continuity problems and holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Of course, the mecha was good to see (especially those of the "Macross Saga")) and the parts of the plot remained unharmed were good. But all that was good in Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "vocal talents" he recruited. It was because of the efforts and efforts of the (unaccredited - why? I would be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually found the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now wish they had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are much better, of course, and make more sense. <br /> <br /> Robotech, however, did something useful: it prompted the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators "Intellectual property resulting from such unauthorized reworking and unsolicited that people without talent like Carl Macek produce.
