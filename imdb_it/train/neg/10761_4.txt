This film was a disaster. He had the absolute worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost as if at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go into advertising, and the director added a second black screen to satisfy the writers' dream. <br /> <br /> Under the messy direction and assembly, there was a glimpse of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere it went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest who is trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as a priest. Well, the part does not require that he be a good priest and he does quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the evil fool. Always sound the bad fool. Oh, I was reminded of a thought that perhaps all the hopping, horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add meaning to the confusion the character (Grieco) was experiencing. And just to prove that it was invented they rolled the credit backwords. It is not a good sign for any film. <br /> <br />
