SCARECROWS seems to be a cheeky horror that meets the supernatural film. A group of thugs pulls out a paramilitary payroll robbery at Camp Pendleton, California. They raised a cargo plane by kidnapping the pilot and his daughter with requests to be transported to Mexico. Along the way an avid robber decides to save himself by landing money in a cornfield controlled by strange-looking scarecrows. These aren't just scary scarecrows ... they can kill. Acting is no better than horrible dialogue. And attempts at humor are not fun. Very low budget and shot entirely in the dark. <br /> <br /> The cast includes: Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Kristina Sanborn, B.J. Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria Christian.
