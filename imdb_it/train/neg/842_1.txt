This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was barely inside. This film was simply horrible. If you want to laugh and get bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic you are. I'm sorry, Michael. The cinematography was dark. All other actors are unknown. When you look at it, it looks like soft porn, but without nude scenes or heated scenes. This film has sexual connotations, since it is an underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except for the parts of Michael Madsen. He seemed to want to laugh. I hope he was paid well for this bad movie. It's something I wouldn't be proud of. It's not even a B movie for cable, it's more like an F and should never be shown, ever.
