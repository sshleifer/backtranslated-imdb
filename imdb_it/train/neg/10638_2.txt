Show that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. This is definitely plastic, all the way through. It is easy to see that without Quentin's involvement, this would probably have been on the shelf for years, assuming it would ever be produced in the first place. This is a woman with a death charm who gets a job cleaned up after crime scenes, Angela Jones is not convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better as a Serial Killer who keeps Jones in business! All in all rather poor.
