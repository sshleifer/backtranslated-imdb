My husband and I are the parents of an autistic child who lives in the same township as the writer of this film. We were very disappointed that the JCC is bringing this film to its Jewish film festival because of the way Frankie's mentally disabled character is portrayed. We went to see this movie at the local theater when it came out. We asked for the money back. We encourage the writer to donate a portion of the funds to the JCC's Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We didn't like to see Frankie - a mentally disabled and perhaps even autistic teenager - as part of a joke that keeps dropping something to watch the nanny's breasts. <br /> <br /> There was no sense in Frankie's character except to say "hey, being mentally disabled is fun". Challenges like Frankie's are serious. Families like mine are really suffering. <br /> <br /> The writer must explain himself. Do you know families with disabled children? Do you see families with disabled children week after week in the JCC pool?
