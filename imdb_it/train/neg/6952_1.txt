The most horrible revisitation of a great series. Battlestar Galactica should not have been baptized, because it is the same only in the name. Too many changes to make changes only. You have characters transformed from male to female, from black to Asian to cylon all in a way to "attract the female audience", when there were already strong female characters that could have been made stronger. The Egyptian feelings are over. The search for the land is over. The lack of cylinders to go to the terminator discards takes away from the film, especially when a fembot has been made. Guaranteed that the original show had a lot of cheese, but had a great following. They tried to keep this up, but they didn't give the fans anything to work on and basically spit in their face while they do "their story". The changes are good, when they do something better, not just to make them.
