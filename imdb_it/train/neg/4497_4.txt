- I planned to write something explaining what I don't like about this movie, but it will be more difficult than I thought. Honestly, I don't remember much about this. I only saw him three days ago and he almost had no impression on me. It is usually the sign of a real stinker. The only thing I remember was being incredibly bored of most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart like the detective has quickly vanished. It would be different if he could act, but he is an entertainer of a single note. The killing scenes were managed in an amateur way and there was no suspense that preceded them. If you can't locate the killer for five minutes in the movie, you have to see more of the Euro's horror. The casting is a mortal homage to the identity of the killer.
