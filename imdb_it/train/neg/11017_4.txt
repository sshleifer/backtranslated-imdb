A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive. The traitor's husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of his phobia by putting her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course the horror movie queen B Brinke Stevens turns into a horrible spooky creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk movie is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody fury are pretty fun to watch. The special effects for example ridicule the decapitated head is really terrible. Look again at "Scalp" or "Alien Dead". Of course I don't expect classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be funny.
