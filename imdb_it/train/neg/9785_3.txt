This film, for a post-school special, is not so bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel like you're still in class. A guy teaches a group of underprivileged youths how to be good paint ball players. We never see these losers hurt, since the good player is training them. They suddenly turn into good players meditating. Also there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other children. This may have had a feeling of 'Bad News Bears' (the original) since there was a girl on a team of all the guys, but there was no feeling for this movie. He has no feelings and leaves a dull ache in his bones after seeing it, it's not fun to wear, it's not fun to watch, and it's just kind of ... there. Plain. Boring. Something you'd see after school before your afternoon nap. How boring as the day is long and it was a long, long day watching this movie.
