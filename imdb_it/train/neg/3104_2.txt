I've done a lot of reviews on IMDb and this movie is unique in the sense that I've never seen the whole movie. He was so terribly stupid and not funny that I couldn't sit - even if I tried. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with this and all the Mel Brooks movies I call "Mel's quotient". In other words, the better his film, the less he sees in the film. Think about it: the producers and the young Frankenstein were great films and he was barely in them. BUT movies like Life Stinks and Space Balls are packed with Mel and they're pretty cool movies (yes, I DON'T LIKE Space Balls - but this isn't the right place to talk about it). <br /> <br /> Secondly, apart from cancer, rectal itching and mental retardation, I can't think of a less enjoyable topic than the homeless. This is just a comedian. Think about it, people. The FUNNIEST scene (?) In the movie he has Mel spying with Leslie Ann Warren in a dumpster !! And that's funny how?
