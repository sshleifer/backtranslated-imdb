Lou's Gospel was a great disappointment to me. I had received an e-mail from the theater which showed that it was a fantastic and inspirational film. He was neither great nor inspiring. The cinematography was rather uncertain with the whole film. Very the scenes were flashbacks that were made in a way that could not sometimes tell what it was. The voices were often distorted for no reason. Many of the people in the film were also far-fetched. His relationship with his ex and son is never clarified. Even the whole movie has most of him in one way, and then suddenly BAM, is a cared for and inspiring people. The whole film seems to show that boxing is one of the things that is bad in his life, making him live his life the way he is living it, but when he changes, he doesn't leave boxing, he teaches others how to box. Thumb down.
