Actually I had great hopes in this film, so I took what I was given with a pinch of salt and hoped for the best. At about 1/3 of the film I simply had to give up, simply the film is a mixture of things that happen for no apparent reason and it's all disconnected. I love movies that make you think, but this film was just a set of ideas put together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's David Lynch-esquire as some would have us believe, it's nowhere near that realm as well as sad images. To say that it is artistic to mask the fact that there is no apparent plot or story is only one way or to justify why you wasted the 1.5 hours in the film. The acting was good, but this cannot save the lack of stories. I agree with the only comment published earlier ... "it's like being in the head of another person ... while on drugs", in other words, it doesn't make sense.
