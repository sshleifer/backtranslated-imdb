Black and white movies. Good photography Credible characters <br /> <br /> Just horrible. <br /> <br /> I wasted another perfect evening watching a movie that others considered "worthy" and "very good". There is good acting here and the back ground setting for the plot is good (more should have been done with this) but it is very slow to grow and never develops. It is totally based on sex without much romance with unnecessary nudity. More could have been done with the main characters. If you are looking for something to look at with your family, this is not the movie and if you don't, you will have trouble following it. Although this film is long it is only about 1 inch deep!
