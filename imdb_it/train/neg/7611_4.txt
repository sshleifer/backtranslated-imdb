1st watched on 28/02/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - I saw the DVD version entitled "3 Days of the Condor" - So the CIA drama is full of relaxing performances that make the all very relaxed movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 members out of 8 of a CIA research group that is killed with the character of Robert Redford, code name = Condor, which is the one left. Who killed them and why? This is what Redford tries to find out while trying not to be the eighth victim at the same time. Along the way, it involves the character of Faye Dunaway, originally because she needs a place to hide, and eventually she helps him after a while. This is one of a handful of stories of innocent kids, but this doesn't have much suspense. The flat performance doesn't help and the goal doesn't quite seal the agreement for the public. Despite having a good director at Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the performances are not what they should be and so the film is not what it should be.
