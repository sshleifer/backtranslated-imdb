What is the most heartbreaking film ever made? The gynecological nightmare of "Cries and Whispers"? Fassbinder's acid psychodrama? The last black comedy of 'Last House on the left? I'm sure that for that part of the movie-loving public that ties their trees to the good ship Buster Keaton, there's only one answer - each of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know what has fretted my soul more sharply in this film - the foundation of Keaton's intricate and expansive art with farce humility; the painful hesitation of this master director with dialogue - not that he doesn't have a nice comic voice, or that he can't make dialogue fun; it's just that the studio doesn't seem to have given him enough slack, so it looks like he's trying to remember his lines before delivering, which makes him alone - Keaton, not his character, seems silly; or is it the humiliation of seeing Keaton caught in a farce of vulgar sex, when he gave us some of the richest tales of romantic frustration in the movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know what bothered us the most: having to watch Buster Keaton, the greatest comedian in the cinema, sit down to watch Jimmy Durante while he was doing the fuck. They are horrors like this that make your Dantes make up your Infernos. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have had the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to the sound was to transform it into a brother Marx, complete with verbal pedantry, elaborate, boring "clown", Slavic farce, theatrical setting, triumph of chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not that kind of comic, and where Groucho's mischievous language and cheerful opportunism could have made this plot a job, Buster's socially inept professor cannot, is too studied and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to allow experiments like Lang in 'M', or Rene Clair; he would never try to hold back the tide like Chaplin. When one refers to a film like "The General", which is confused with trains, the loss becomes even more evident. <br /> <br /> And the fact is that, in the patches in the middle of the flat direction, the film is not so bad - there is an excellent shock when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone in a station train; and the dissolution, if just original, is at least more lively than what happened before. There is something almost catchy in the way Keaton slows down a storyline that needs all the zip it can get. <br /> <br /> Here is a film about loneliness, the emotionally paralyzing order, the paralyzing effects of education, etc., struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film is to look not at Professor TZ Post's narrative, but at the emasculated genius Buster Keaton, trapped in a prison of mediocrity, confused by new technology, derided by a malicious destiny (in this case the study), keeping a stoic grace. It seems so, it becomes a kind of masterpiece.
