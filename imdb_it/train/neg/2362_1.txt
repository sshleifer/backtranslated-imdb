The first of the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror films of all time. This is the most disgusting. When I sat down to watch this, I was really thinking how bad the fourth and fifth were, it would have been nice after those terrible precedents. The boy was wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it would improve. Has not been. <br /> <br /> Not only is this just a terrible movie on its own, it didn't need another sequel, because the last two (the fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back ?! The acting in it was TERRIBLE, the plot was predictable and disgusting and also had flaws. The way they created Springwood was completely wrong. He has no respect for the first. To add to this, the whole thing seemed really exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie was "funny". This film is not at all "funny". Since when should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I would call it strangely shit. This film should be a horror film, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, wouldn't this information emerge as in the first one? The ending was also simply stupid and poor, just like the rest. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the former. It simply shows. <br /> <br /> Such a pity that Wes Craven created something so beautiful in the beginning, yet it must be dragged down because of this basket that belongs to the basket. They shouldn't even bother making this movie. Neither of the other sequels, except the third. The third is the only decent of all sequels. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD by itself and was not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set I had, I would have thrown it out when I realized. <br /> <br /> Summary: a pathetic and poor attempt at sequel. <br /> <br /> - a complete MOCKER of the first movie <br /> <br /> So please don't waste time on this worthless stuff.
