I like silent movies, but this was a little too stupid. As much as I wish I could say it was worth the time I got up, I can't. I don't think any version of the film comes close to the book. And don't try it with children, they might be scary. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different then ... BUT COME ON PEOPLE.
