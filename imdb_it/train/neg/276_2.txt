The characters are clich√© and predictable, with all being snow-white or completely evil. The acting is too makeup because it's bad in a fun and amazing way. It is doubly disappointing if you are a Bette Davis fan, because his character is not a typically Davis drinkable character; Overall, she and I or my wife found the film interesting, moving or funny.
