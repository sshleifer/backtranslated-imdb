Would anyone really see this RUBBISH if it didn't contain small children running around naked? From a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. One day he woke up one day and I thought I was going to make a movie with the girls and I would call it art, pasted in the countryside and there is no need for a story or explanation of how they arrived or why they didn't appear live anywhere or have parents because movies don't need anything like that. I would like to comment on the rest of the film but I didn't check out spoilers, so I'll just say avoid, avoid avoiding and find a suitable movie to watch
