the Germans all stand out and are mowed with a machine gun. the good never die, except for dramatic purposes. the "plot" has so many holes that it is laughable. (Where did the German soldiers go when they rolled the fuel tank to the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijack a train? How idiotic she is! The Germans know where you're going, it's not like you can leave the track and get away! What a waste. I'd rather flop my head with a ball hammer 10 times, so I'll have to sit down again. I mean, seriously, I like that it was created in the 60s, but it was produced in 1988 !! 1988 !! the A-Team is more credible than this horrible excuse for a movie. Look at it only if you need a good laugh. This film is for Tele Sevalas what Green Beret was for John Wayne.
