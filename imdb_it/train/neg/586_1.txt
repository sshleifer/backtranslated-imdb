After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It wasn't the same thing without Spur and Harrison, as played by Douglas. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was - Jim returns after a prolonged absence, to find Jessica being chased by another man. He couldn't expect a girl to wait that long without any contact from him, and not find competition. For a Disney movie, this contains vulgar language, in addition to the very useless part when Jim and Jessica joined without being married - very LAME. Rather an insult to the intelligence of the spectators, according to the members of my family. I will continue with the first one and I will try to forget that I have ever seen the sequel!
