This film has so little class compared to Strangers on a Train or even, Accidental Meeting for that subject, that despite the similarities of the plot I wouldn't feel like comparing it with either of them. The character of Yancy Butler came across a fool so stupid that I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to keep watching. <br /> <br /> I don't like many Lifetime movies but I feel compelled to watch one every so often in the interest of promoting harmony at home. I often moan silently but this film made me protest loudly, get up from the room and walk around the house muttering to myself, before returning to my favorite chair for more torture. <br /> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
