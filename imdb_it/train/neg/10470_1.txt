What else is left to say? <br /> <br /> I have read all the reviews here and most are correct. . However, one person came to define this evil movie and Satan contaminated it (or something like that). Evil?! Wow, what a shock. . I mean, TBN pretty much made this film. Please open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Anway, this was the lowest degree of absurdity of the propoghanda that has come forward over the years. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying thing about Omega Code is how much money they spent on it. If this film can be made, there are no limits and therefore we have no choice but to prepare for "Yentl 2" and "Ernest loses the Omega codes". <br /> <br /> For those of you in biblical stories, the new movie Dogma will pick up where the Omega Code never started.
