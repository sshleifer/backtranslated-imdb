My God, what's going on? a film by Uwe Boll and positive comments? Wow! <br /> <br /> It is nice to note that most of the positive reviews come from newcomers to Boll's work. I myself, as I stated in previous reviews of Uwe Boll, only look at his films in the hope that one day he will realize something good. I mean ... I HAVE TO HAPPEN A DAY! <br /> <br /> Alas, Seed is not that day. I don't know where to start with the lame attempt of a horror movie that is Seed. The thing to remember is that all the sick in the world are like this because they have seen various sick acts on video or on the net ..... or so Boll thinks. For the life of me, I still can't understand why in the first 10 minutes of this film requires footage of abuse and killing of real animals. I understand the concept that Seed (the killer) is a sicko and enjoys looking at things like that ..... but he can't understand why Mr. Boll thought a REAL movie would work in the film. Maybe to shock us? Hmmm ..... well, I'm not fussy first and can handle anything on the movie. I do not know, however, to find the use of cruelty scenes on real animals that entertain at a minimum. If you were trying to shock me, it didn't work. He just reminded me of how messed up the world has been because things like that happen and also because Uwe Boll is allowed to continue making films. This type of context may have worked for films in the 70s / 80s (the Cannibal holocaust) but not in today's market. <br /> <br /> With that, we can move on to the fact that Uwe has managed to give the film a very cheap all-round feel like BloodRayne 2. It can only be said that there was not a great deal of money around for the production. <br /> <br /> As usual, Mr. Boll does not care much to make a decent story, while we deal with boring shots from cops who watch various videos of Seed's victims in the first 25 minutes. Each of these videos ends in a quick decomp of the victim. It's all very boring and boring. I will not comment on the child's scene as it is ridiculous and just another economic 'shock' factor. <br /> <br /> If you can sit for the first 25 minutes, you will be treated to police officers walking through a very dark house to capture Seed. The lighting here is horrible and Uwe has the old "I'm not using a constant flask" he did with BloodRayne 2. See how the cops die in increasingly stupid ways until a point like Seed is captured. This scene is so damn stupid that you have to see it to believe it. In reality, the policeman tells Seed that he could have shot him. For some little-known reason, the policeman does not shoot him. Since Seed is a sicko who kills both children and adults, at this point in the script you would have thought what sense would have prevailed. <br /> <br /> From here we are treated to a stupid execution scene, followed by the cops who bury Seed alive (and know he is alive .. why not shoot him in the head ????), followed by Seed who he comes out of the ground and then kills a woman at random with a hammer and then kidnaps him from the policeman's family. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to convey to all of you is that it's simply STUPID! It's not even the stupid Hollywood horror ... just stupid. Uwe Boll cannot direct ****. Anyone with a few ounces of taste would agree with this statement. Anyone who watches this movie and finds it funny in any way shape or form, needs to look seriously as a person. <br /> <br /> Once again we are treated to a piece of shit UB badly interpreted, directed, enlightened, produced, written.
