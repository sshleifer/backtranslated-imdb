This is really terrible: irritating and irritating stylized artists play strident and moan inconsistent dialogues that take place in scenes that seem to have no purpose, a beginning, a center or an end, cut together without any apparent narrative or cognitive intention, all at service of a "story" quite uninteresting and almost unobservable. What makes the film worse is the claim of "style": suddenly a round-headed crane shoots downward spirals and, for no apparent reason, there are sudden pans or rickety sections: all this "style" only serves to magnify the incredible, almost incredible misunderstanding of the project and the almost offensive emptiness of the material. Definitely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
