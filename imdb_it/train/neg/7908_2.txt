I didn't expect much when I saw him at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternative choice when two other films were sold out. However, I held out hope. It seemed a bit like "Bride and Prejudice" (the character of L.A. falls for an Indian beauty, the parents' conflict, bla bla bla). B & P was not perfect but it was a funny movie with some nice laughs and nice characters. <br /> <br /> "My Bollywood bride" had none. The acting seemed to be written down and off to the number. The characters were so clich√© that the story seemed as if it had been written by a freshman acting student. Technically, the sound really annoyed me. There seemed to be a lot of dialogue over-dubbing. I mean a lot. I know that sometimes it is necessary but it seems that half of the film was shot in a closet and this has become very annoying. <br /> <br /> Two stars are rather generous.
