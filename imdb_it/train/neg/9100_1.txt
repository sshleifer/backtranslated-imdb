Christ, oh Christ ... One looks stunned, incredulous, and perhaps unbalanced, while this dark exercise of endless soot unfolds with all the intelligence and dexterity of a turtle of the Galapagos parasite. Can they be things like that? Does this film really exist, or was I the unaware guinea pig of some obscure international drug company, sipping my coffee oblivious to the fact that it was added to a dangerous hallucinogen? I have seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing has prepared me for it; at the end of it I was a jerky wreck, tearing the carpet with my teeth like a dog, clawing at the walls, howling until my lungs hurt. I desperately pleaded, frantically pity (to which this appeal was made, I don't know), and I yearned for a burning desire for the soothing balm of Ozu Yasujiro. Sweet crying Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I'm in my most vulnerable place, when I'm least able to handle them. I shiver, I tear myself down in tears, I bite my nails until my hands are stained with blood, but I can't banish the terrible flashbacks from my mind. I'm persecuted. I'm injured I'm a shell of a man. <br /> <br /> The other user comments here suggest that I am not the only one to have experienced this terrifying experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the film does, in fact, exist, or b) I am just a victim among legions of an international conspiracy of truly sinister proportions. What is quite upsetting is that some people seem to have appreciated their ordeal, or at least not been traumatized. Perhaps they are part of the operation. God damn them, the maniacs! God hurt them all in hell !!!!!!
