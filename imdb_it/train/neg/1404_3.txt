Arthur Askey's great skill as a comedian was in the way he communicated with his audience. His youthful jokes, silly songs and silly dances went down well because he was able to involve people and draw them into his world off the wall. The lack of a live audience was a clear disadvantage for him, and he was never completely comfortable in the movies. He has his moments in The Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been adapted to make the most of his talents, but Askey the interpreter had to be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> The support of Askey in the film is not strong, it includes the regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a couple of drugged honeymooners; Linden Travers goes beyond the lines like a "crazy woman". On board there are also Peter Murray-Hill, who played the lead role in the off-screen part of Phyllis Calvert, giving a totally bland reading of the part, and the protagonist lady Carol Lynne, who turns into an equally bland performance. Lead actress Kathleen Harrison effortlessly steals the film like a single woman who loves parrots and is destroyed by the brandy of Dr Morland Graham.
