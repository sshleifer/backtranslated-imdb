The following are some of the most obvious problems in this film: 1) The clichés abound. Seriously, terrible "twists and turns" are everywhere. <br /> <br /> 2) The narrative leaps over time, which would be fine if done well, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3) Lame characters that do not develop so much as to remain or completely static, or change drastically without a good reason. <br /> <br /> 4) Big one: HORRIBLE ACTING. Over the top from almost every person. <br /> <br /> The following are some of the film's best points: 1) The main character is damn beautiful. <br /> <br /> As I see it, there are only two types of people who will want to enter this film: a) People who can sit for 90 minutes of tripe simply because the protagonist is attractive. <br /> <br /> b) People who often think of themselves "I like the charm of Hollywood full of clichés and exaggerations, but if only I could watch it in Korean ..." There is a lot of good Korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?
