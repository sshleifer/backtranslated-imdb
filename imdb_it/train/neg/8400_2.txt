Not even the most dedicated fan of the scimmi could appreciate the film, (I am one of them), but the minions have no material to work with. It's really a pity, because this is the only feature that the minions have done with Curly, and this effort on their part is painfully little fun, when it could have great potential. The terrible musical numbers do not help either of them. The short they did with the same title has more laughter.
