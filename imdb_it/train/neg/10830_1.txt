1999 will go down in history as the year in which the film critic led the public astray. First they sent us to WIDE SHUT EYES. Then they launched THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it? Who the hell knows. It is full of self-indulgence and full of bad acting. I always like to watch the credits, but when this thing ended I couldn't get out of the cinema fast enough. Most of the audience that participated in the show I was in felt more or less the same way. The dates discussed among themselves and with strangers. It's a bad and hateful movie that will make you feel ugly and hateful.
