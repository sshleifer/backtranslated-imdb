Do you not only hate it when you order the steak but the restaurant gives you the chicken? <br /> <br /> Here's how I felt about watching this so-called "Battlestar Galactica". The arguments can be made about its quality, but the fact remains, it is NOT what the fans have ordered. <br /> <br /> Imagine if you were sitting in that proverbial restaurant that I mentioned. You've waited years for them to bring back their famous New York Strip steak that you loved. When your meal arrives, find out that they have applied the name "New York Strip" to a chicken dish. You complain but the waiter just says "ma ze cheeken, ees uh GOOD zir"! Do you really care if the chicken is good? You wanted the New York Strip, a STEAK! The waiter then explains, "you zee zir, ze chef wanted to do, while you zap, zomezing NEW. We felt ze heeken would be more popular or we gave the name of our previous delicious deesh". Ask if in the future you will find the original New York Strip on the menu, but you are told that since the restaurant HAS a dish called "New York Strip" now on the menu, you will never see the original New York Strip - never again. <br /> <br /> Such is the case with the creation of something NEW and slapping the homonymous "Battlestar Galactica". <br /> <br /> * This mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show! * <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the production team in charge of this new version obviously disliked the original. The BG resuscitation team should have LOVED the original series - trying to improve what the fans loved, not trying to shamelessly sell this new series using the Battlestar Galactica name. <br /> <br /> If you wanted SciFi Channel to give us a new show, then do it! Give it a new name! Don't use the name we remember fondly in an attempt to attract viewers. This deprives us of the possibility of seeing any appearance of the original in the future. <br /> <br /> We have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as BG because we liked something about the original! We didn't simply want the NAME and the remnants of the basic concept. There are things we love about the original series! <br /> <br /> Sadly, probably the BEST elements of the original were those that were omitted. Of course, the original BG was imperfect and could have been updated. This mini series, however, was not an improvement in all respects, but the special effects (which were good but not unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers will discuss back and forth about the quality of this NEW show but we do not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore for destroying our dream. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... I will offer some comments on the merits of this new mini by itself (not compared to the original): <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were the best part. Obviously the effort was put into making the effects more "real" in appearance and less "wow - look at that effect". I would not say that these sequences were exceptional by today's standards, but they were in line with the original films made on cable. What was the agreement with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some views have tried to simulate the effect of a "real" camera with delayed tracking and jerky zoom. However, it was too used considering that there was no apparent SOURCE of these cameras. The infinitely smarter series, Babylon 5, is the only instance in which I saw such "live cams" used effectively, when we had to attend Security Cams actions. <br /> <br /> The script, ask? The script seemed to have been written by a teenager, FOR other teenagers. The characters felt like cardboard and stereotyped. In fact, the whole story has been put together by other well-known stereotypes. The only good features of the whole story were those few elements that had been preserved from the original series. He was obviously "amazed" by the digestion of your average TV audience. <br /> <br /> Human interaction has been pitiful. Rather than a drama based on subtle looks, expressions and excellent timing, every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious that they lost all ability to move any refined spectator. This was obvious in every interaction between Adama and his son. The director must have tried to make sure that the densest and most insensitive viewer would not lose it even if he didn't pay attention. Sorry, but real humans do not behave like continuous ones. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't have considered this a BAD show if it was alone. Nothing exceptional; he will never be revered by the true SciFi fans or craftsmen, but would be watchable by the masses. Personally I could have lived without it, though. I just saw it to see how it really captured the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> The way this mini series will always be remembered is a symbol of how the quality of the narrative has been set aside to attract more. As even SciFi Channel has "played down" its productions to satisfy the masses in contrast to its true niche market, Science Fiction fans. It will be the moment when we ask for the steak and they insisted on giving us some chicken, despite our complaints. <br /> <br /> I leave you with just one thought - <br /> <br /> NO "MOORE". <br /> <br />
