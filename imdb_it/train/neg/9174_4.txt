I usually like zombie movies, but this was just plain ugly. <br /> <br /> The beautiful parts: topless girl swimming with thongs, Sonya Salomaa topless, and Ona Grauer's tits shaking in a skimpy top when she runs. <br /> <br /> The worst part: too many videos, too many slow-moving movements of the Matrix (drag the action), not enough blood and guts, bad acting and no story. The only other person in the theater was intelligent and left immediately after the topless swimming scene. A total waste of $ 6 and time. I give him a 2 out of 10.
