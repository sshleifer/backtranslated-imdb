After watching this movie on DVD, I watched the trailer. The voiceover describes the film as surreal. Well, there is surreal, and there is surreal. <br /> <br /> There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly it was more confusing than surreal. The other unusual images, particularly the canteen scene where everyone is on the floor, were so meaningless that they had no meaning. I don't care about images that mean nothing, but these scenes seemed irrelevant to me. <br /> <br /> My impression is that the director was trying to broadcast Logan's inner monologue. I don't know what else would explain what was happening. Unfortunately, nothing I saw gave me the idea of ​​what Logan was thinking, what his perspective was or even his emotional state. All I could say was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance and that he had a crush on an older boy. <br /> <br /> I thought the ending indicated what the relationship was between the guys, but not much else. The right juxtaposition of ambiguous scenes with simpler ones seemed more like a policeman than an artistic decision. <br /> <br /> Again, as tiring and lacking in content the film was for me, it was a definite change of pace. I really liked Madagascar Skin, and I had the feeling that this film aspired to that kind of narrative, and maybe even style. He didn't even come close. For me there is no doubt: this film deserves an effort A, but a D to run.
