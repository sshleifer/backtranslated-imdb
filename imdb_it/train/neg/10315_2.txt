I can't believe people thought this smelly pile of garbage was fun. Shifting the humorous attempts between cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "There's Something About Mary" leaves little reason to stay until the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but it will never be enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller strives to work within the plot, and is obviously very talented, but the film is a loser. <br /> <br /> Not once were any of the scenes credible. The shots were poorly programmed and poorly framed. The Farreley brothers should be kept away from making films at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on, so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; the bonus is from the time I smiled. It's not that I'm immune to humor or just in my opinion. My wife hated it too. The next day we saw "Rush Hour" and we had fun laughing. This movie is just smelly.
