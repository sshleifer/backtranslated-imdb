Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This happened at 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thank God my son was out or I would have been crazy if he had seen the soft / medium porn! Do people who make films not care about those who offend or corrupt? Could the kids look after the church and this is what they show ??? !!! The acting was good and I liked the suspense but GEE! There was violence and villains, but that's to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good at his role. If the writers, directors and producers stopped wearing such unusual sex scenes. What must happen to convince them to stop going in that direction? Where can I complain?
