The mind, my friends and I have seen the film based on its title alone. It's nice, though obvious in the plot and in the direction ... you know where the film will go within the first five minutes. My main argument with the plot is that while it remains tolerably coherent, it never explains many of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, an overworked mother, a stressed sister ... a bad family, but apart from the occasional mention of his sister, there is no solution. I was also confused about the bottle scene ... it seemed pretty random. <br /> <br /> Writing is a secondary concern ... children were not bad actors, but their script left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a nice niche movie was put aside for a single, special effect blah, a lame script and an obviously obvious plot.
