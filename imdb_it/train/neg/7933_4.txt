I'm a big fan of Randolph Scott, but this film is a real disaster. Everything has a sensation in a box, fake, on the stage, with a really scary projection of the rear window. He has a good plot idea that the writer has successfully buried in a nitwit script, which makes it impossible for the audience to immerse themselves in the action and really care about any character. The direction is pedestrian and only emphasizes how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I have already seen many really nice "productions on stage", but this is not one of them. All he does is make you appreciate Scott / Boetticher's gritty movies even more. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is tanned, tidy and shines with that million-dollar smile. It's always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his films. Apart from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this film was because of how much I liked Mrs. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, "Rocky Mountian". In "Man Behind the Gun", she is equally beautiful, and one can say that she is a good actress, but she was forced to say some stupid lines, and the block given to her by the director was really terrible. I saw Phil Carey only in "Operation Pacific" and he plays the same identical character here ... an arrogant pain-in-the-butt that you want to beat unconsciously. I guess you prove he's a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic relief that, in my opinion, only limit the film. Although there are many elements to beat, I must say that I really enjoyed the two Spanish songs sung in musical numbers ... but that's not why we're going to see Randolph Scott's movies, right? <br /> <br /> There are certainly worse films than Scott out there, and this is certainly not unbearable, but certainly could not be considered anything other than mediocre.
