This Italian movie from the 70s is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that horrible American werewolf in Paris, BUT ... it's fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a gorgeous blonde, unleashed in her birthday dress. We're talking about graphics, complete nakedness ... it's obvious that she's a real blonde ... humma humma humma !! The story is a hoot, the SFXs are childish and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only salvific value of this film is everything (and there is a lot) in the nude and sex scenes. Domesticated by HBO standards, but still fun to watch when you find yourself without a Saturday night appointment. OK ... HERE IS THE SPOILER ... There is no werewolf (except in the opening scene of the ancestor of the heroine (??). The girl just imagines that she is a werewolf ... in other words , a clinical werewolf.
