I was so upset by the actual movie at the beginning of the film that I felt sick to my stomach and ended up closing the film. How can you give this film more than a rating of 1 baffles me. I know the intent of the film is to shock, but to show the real movie of a dog that had been skinned alive (hold back the vomit while I type) - PLEASE! I turned it off after the rotting baby scene. I had had my eyes covered most of the time up to that point. No wonder this film was found in the abyss of business in HMV. I have no desire to see any other film from this Uwe person. Anyone who has appreciated this needs therapy. Period.
