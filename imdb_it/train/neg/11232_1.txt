It's so sad. Although this film was shot with the film, I think it's a bit worse than movies like Blood Lake, There's Nothing Out There &. The music they play in this is the most fun stuff I've ever heard. I like brother and sister in this movie. Both don't try very hard to sound sarcastic when they say things like "My friends will be so jealous!" Hey, what is the killer wearing only the mask at the beginning? That is delayed! I practically ignored the second part of this. My favorite part of this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer uses the ax. The same exact sound for every chop!
