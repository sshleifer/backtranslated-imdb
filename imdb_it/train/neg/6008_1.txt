If you made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, please don't give up the series. I bought my first copy of any of the books in May of this year, and I've almost finished with book 10. I dare say that the film is a piece of junk that doesn't even make a series of justice. While "Left Behind: the movie" only vaguely follows the story of the "Left Behind" (the book), the characters are nowhere near as accurate. <br /> <br /> Some examples: Rayford never acts his feelings for Hattie (he stands for when he is informed of the disappearances); Buck Williams is a blond-haired magazine writer, not a television reporter; Chloe is at Stanford, and many of the details of the Rayford book wondered if she had "survived"; Buck and Chloe don't meet much later, during a meeting in New York, organized by Hattie; Irene and Raymie are never "in the book", rather just in Rayford's flashback thoughts; the streets are so full of wrecks after the kidnapping that Rayford and Hattie have to take by helicopter to the suburbs ... etc. etc. etc. <br /> <br /> And this is only from the first movie; are about to release the third. Please, even if you don't like movies, give the book series a chance.
