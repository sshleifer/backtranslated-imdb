This film looks so EMPTY. In every scene of the film the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10. Because everything was filmed in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the film seems really strange. <br /> <br /> ACT was HORRIBLE! It is so obvious that this was in front of a blue screen because all the action scenes are seen by the actor / actress who asks about half the run when they should run for their lives. Looking at the floor for their marks ... <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Also you'll find yourself banging your head watching the movie. At one point in the Sky Captain home base they have 100 planes sitting on the landing strip. They raised the alarm that an attack is coming ... So what do they do? Anything. All the planes are blown up and once again the ONLY person who fights back is Captain Sky ... <br /> <br /> THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he is the ONLY person who always fights. At the end of the film you will finally see hundreds of plains take off ... but what do they do? Nothing ... the movie is finished ...
