The film was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of Joeseph Conrad's Heart Of Darkness, that the River is replaced by a road and that the boat becomes a Jeep and Walter Kurtz is Osama. <br /> <br /> The claims made outside the DVD box were obvious frauds for <br /> <br /> taking this death fabricated by a journalist and presenting it as a fact <br /> <br /> while some parts have Muslims supporting 9/11 attacks for US treatment of Muslims around the world. <br /> <br /> I advised the video store that the film should be removed from the "Documentary" section and be placed in the War-drama area for near-fictional stories of real events.
