An insignificant and non-memorable remake of an old famous British film. Although it may be excessively maligned as a total disaster (which it is not), it never creates any tension and betrays its television origins. Richard Burton sleepwalking through his role, and the closed face of Sophia Loren (in this film) does not show much passion. (**)
