This is the biggest load of crap I've seen in a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was watching "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no sense in this film, except to see some really sick and twisted sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relaxing on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialogue that must use the word "F" at least a couple of times. He has extremely cheap acting and a very low budget. In the end my friend and I turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give him a chance, but nothing could save this cruel one. DO NOT LOOK !!!
