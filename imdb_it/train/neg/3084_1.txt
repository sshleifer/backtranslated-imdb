this is the result. A piece of trash film that doesn't even deserve to be classified as a movie, it's just a bunch of things on a movie reel, which makes absolutely no sense. Welcome back to the actors, who from the beginning seem to be just a group of friends who thought they'd put together some money and try to make a movie that would be a great horror movie. Well, it's still a great horror, not being a movie. There's a lot of horrible acting in "Hobgoblins", but the worst is the main guy named Richard, who is too often a faint for even root sort for. Well, when you cast a group of friends and try to make the film scary, with a budget not less than that, it will happen, that's what will happen. Oh well, at least the MST3K version was hilarious. But this is still a horrible film, which deserves all the shots. 9 for the MST version.
