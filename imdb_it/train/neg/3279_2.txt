Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see out there ... I got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to watching this show when I was in college ... was mindless, a little funny and a little action-oriented. The show had a good heart ... and the characters were nice; no one has ever been killed or badly hurt ... it was like a cartoon that comes to life. Reduced to 2005 ... What happened? This does not work. As others have already said, there is simply no cohesive story and the performances are strange ... almost annoying - definitely not faithful to the original characters ... everything is similar to a Mad TV scene and lasts over 100 minutes! This was one of the few times I was EMBARRASSED watching a movie. What were they thinking? As best I can tell, it must have been for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is that this dies quickly. Makes the original Dukes of Hazzard as Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> I think the only remake left to do is Gilligan's Island ... Good Luck!
