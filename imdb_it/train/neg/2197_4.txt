This dates back to the time of the matinee, when the children with no one else to attend took their dates on the balcony after downloading their younger brothers in a row. No matter what was on the screen - small children sat down and big children ignored it. Adults, of course, would never have seen it. <br /> <br /> But they put it on video, however, along with most of the other horror films "B", rude and low-budget of the golden age. .of television. The intrinsic and involuntary humor of this film derives from a stale ideology (the "bad girls" gathered to replace poor Jan's tortured body - they came to it), an abused plot (a mad scientist, trying to interpret God) , violent but conscientious monster (whose presence in the rural laboratory of the scientists so far apparently normal is never completely explained), and the recitation that is polarized in wood or over the lines. <br /> <br /> This is a great party movie, as long as your guests enjoy adding dialogues and comments to otherwise abominable movie exploits. In fact, if you or your guests prefer passive entertainment, this film is also available on video in its "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment, in which the guest and the cult TV series puppets make the necessary additions for you.
