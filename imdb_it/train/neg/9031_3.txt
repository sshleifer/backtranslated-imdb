Payback is the game that takes place in this drama and the plot of revenge is canceled by the absurd plot that prepares the stage for the fireworks that will come later. Why should a man be involved in the trophy wife of a ruthless Mafia boss in the gangster mansion with suspicious followers around? Why should an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a perfect stranger and expect him to take her away with him and leave her husband and boredom to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband to give the film an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he was, certainly deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers a lot while clinging to her prince charming. Stowe is fine, but his Spanish accent doesn't work. The cameos of the minor players are good, in particular Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is as interesting as a faded rock star.
