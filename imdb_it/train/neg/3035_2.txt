We were served - a terrible film. <br /> <br /> Ok, I admit that since I am white and have had no practical experience in the "competitive world of step dance", I may not be exactly an authority on this type of film. On the other hand, I know a bad movie when I see it. <br /> <br /> And, boy, I just saw it. <br /> <br /> Shot in Low-Budget-Vision and directed by Ian Iqubal Rashid, ("A Touch of Pink"), "How She Move" tells the story of how important it is to follow one's dreams - even if those dreams include noisy and irritating hip-hop music and Speaking in dialogue the average person wouldn't understand if he had an international translator. <br /> <br /> I will try to give a small synopsis of the "plot". First of all there are two actors who look like LL Cool J working in a car shop in Toronto (the Mecca of racial diversity), but they still have time to practice dance for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> There are some other guys in this "crew", including a token white dude and a guy who looks like Denzel Washington in "Malcolm X." There are also two women in the film - one looks like Serena Williams and the other looks like Geraldine from the old "Flip Wilson Show". One of these ladies was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all her classes on a drug addict brother. The other girl, a member of Salt N Pepa, is certainly not good at all. <br /> <br /> There is another guy who looks like Eddie Murphy's buckwheat, while he is yet another actor who has a Huggy Bear knock-off. These guys are rival dancers. Obviously, this activity is very hard in the "hood", and everyone is practicing for the big "Step Monster" jam in Detroit. <br /> <br /> Since I wasn't able to understand 90% of the dialogue (maybe some subtitles would have been useful, like in a Bergman movie or in a Snow music video), it's hard to explain what happens, apart from the quarrel, Serena Williams's girlfriend (who never smiles, anyway) becomes a freelance stepper (moving from one group to another), there is a bit of step dance and a lot of irritating hip-hop music. <br /> <br /> It is a typical story from rags to rich; a bit like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Rudy" with annoying rap music in the background, "Cry Freedom" without laughter. <br /> <br /> But why should a film - which could have had a great impact on the black public - contain drug addiction, bad parents and a title that sounds like a newcomer by saying the phrase, "How she moved"? <br /> <br /> I was "moved" from this movie, however. He moved to leave the theater as quickly as possible.
