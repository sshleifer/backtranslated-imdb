Ok, I like B movies ... I know what the B movies represent. But this is just awful. I'm amazed he got such a good overall score. The only saving qualities of this film are the (mainly) splatter marginal effects. Don't get me wrong, gore abounds in this movie - but few effects really hit me (like the anal "probe" ... it was great!). I believe this film was shot on a video camera. Come on, rent at least one Betacam, I've seen porn with better production values ​​(and even better acting). <br /> <br /> Acting - sucked! But not in the Troma or Full Moon mode. <br /> <br /> Story - invented! But that's what you get from movies like these. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets & Props - sucked! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween. <br /> <br /> Duplication and dialogues - get sucked in! Horrible voice (I shouldn't even call it acting) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of good classic horror and B / splatter darts out there and they are not so difficult to track down. Do yourself a favor don't waste time on this shit!
