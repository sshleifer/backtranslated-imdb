A pretty funny piece that tries to show how clever the Orcas are but in the meantime (and quite unaware of them) makes the public look stupid by making the movie more ridiculous. Richard Harris plays Quint .. I'm sorry, he's wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is attracted by the big prey, and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a deadly female whale goes wrong (don't ask) her partner (don't ask) goes on a rampage (don't ask) and starts to beat Captain Nolan (don't ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes he has something in common (don't ask). A really amazing film production here folks. I have to tell you anyway, the beginning (with the sounds of the whales and nothing else) is rather obsessive and the credits (with the most amazing song) are pretty funny.
