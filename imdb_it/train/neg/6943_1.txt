This film is profoundly idiotic. A man wants to take revenge for a crime - but when he puts his revenge into action - there is a video camera aimed at him all the time. Which man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do this for so long in front of a video camera? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script could never happen except with someone unable to dress up destroyed for me - but it became more stupid !!! <br /> <br /> I think that the writers have some serious habits that are cooking their brain cells and making them lose the holes in the plot you can lead a battalion of tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: a man seeks revenge for the death of his loved ones, but in the middle of the plot something goes completely wrong, and then the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> If only these people who wrote this story had not been so stupid as to write totally unrealistic plot turns that could never have happened this way. For the writers I say - ask for help with your serious mental problem.
