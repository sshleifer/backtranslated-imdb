Sundown - with the weakest and most boring vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most senseless and pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, who is moved and every word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the time and rolled observe the rest. <br /> <br /> Vampires don't seem to have any special power - except for strength (sometimes), being able to turn off a lamp with their mind (once) and .. That's it, really. Imagine never counting Dracula walking away worried by a fight because he ran out of bullets? Virtually no other film - Dracula ate it for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as a toothpick. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the film is that a family of four is captured in a fight between vampire gangs, Dracula's against an old geek. It could have been a nice old B-flick fun, but the excessively dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a little too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already spoiled by bats, action mediocre and the ridiculous script. <br /> <br /> In the end it's just too silly to be funny. Of course, it has some fun moments, but they are few and far between.
