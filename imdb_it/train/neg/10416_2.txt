Before seeing this movie, I would have said that I loved everything that Kathy Bates did. Now it's all-less-one. James Woods is pathetic ... not his character, his acting. Someone should have told him that "poor" is not synonymous with dirt, nor ignorant, nor clich√©. Ditto for the stereotypes of Randy Quaid. The only thing he redeems is Henry Thomas, who is not an actor strong enough to carry this soggy mess. If you like the country, you will enjoy the scenery. This is the best I can give him. <br /> <br /> I'm a serious fan of bizarre and independent films, but it's just terrible.
