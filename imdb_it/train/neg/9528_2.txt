These days we talk a lot about torture. This is all this movie. It is a good person who makes a wrong decision. Because of her kindness, she becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women. From that moment on, it was an assault for punishment. I don't know at what point something is done about it. There is a wife and a child out there somewhere; has great feelings of guilt and fear. But there should have been times when he could have acted. The film seems to be someone's joke. I guess in the wake of the Manson murders, we've had a bit of a fixation on people like them. However, why would anyone make a film like this? What an attraction it has except sadism. The conclusion is completely unsatisfactory, but this could have been solved with an obvious twist. Oh good. Another hour and a half of my life.
