I saw this film literally directly after finishing the book, and maybe it was a neutral or very stupid idea. I think it was the second. First of all, it was inaccurate in many small but important details. One of the first things I noticed was, during Winston's daily life in his work, in his conversations, in eating in the cafeteria, etc. He feels free to look unhappy and to give suggestive looks to people without immense fear. One of the most important parts of the book was that, even in small businesses, it was virtually impossible to safely show even just a hint of his true emotions on his face AT ANY TIME. This is also shown in the scenes on the streets of the proletarians. In the book Winston knew that this was a huge risk to roam around and he was skeptical and scared with every trip. While in the film, he does it often and without fear, losing the important feeling of heavy surveillance and risking the blow. <br /> <br /> Other minor inaccuracies included Winston hiding his diary in the wall, yes a very small change, but the question arises, what's the point? There was also the most annoying thing a director could do with a book, and that's the morphing of the characters. <br /> <br /> The great inaccuracies were much more disturbing, however. First of all, one of the important pieces of the book is that Big Brother is a government based on an intelligent but crude philosophy. In the film, they skip it and go straight to making you think that the government is run by Hitler with technology. Which is true, in a sense, when it is directed with its facism, but if that's all you get from Big Brother, you've really lost the point of the book. The terrifying thing about Big Brother is that, somehow, he has some points behind his philosophy. When O'Brien is choosing the mind of Winstons in the Ministry of Love, he is listening to everything that Winston says against Big Brother. The fact that he listens, and advances in his philosophy, is in fact what is most gruesome and intriguing. In the end, (careful SPOILER forward) when Winston says he loves Big Brother, the terrifying thing is that you are not sure if it was really the beating and torture that caused this, or the real power behind the philosophy. I am not at all saying that the philosophy of Big Brother has points that attract me, but his intelligence and depth are what make this book incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> Also, how can you feel any connection between Julia and Winston in the film? It was horrible, with no connection. <br /> <br /> And where was O'Brien before giving Winston his address? One of the things the book carried was Winstons' thoughts on O'Brien BEFORE he got in touch with him. In the film, they just skip the gun. <br /> <br /> But this sums up because this film was a terrible adaptation: because it's impossible NOT to jump the gun and transform the characters in less than two hours. How can you think that this film is watchable if it took less than two hours? At the very least, the film takes 3 hours to be able to capture some of the important moods and connections. Anything less is simply useless. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, and I mean REALLY adored, you wouldn't approve this movie, and the odds are that you already knew you wouldn't do it. Because the book is adamant and this film shows how impossible it is to create something decent in a small reel of film. <br /> <br /> Two out of ten stars
