I will give credit to those who are due the credit and I will say that Linda Fiorentino offers a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. It is cheeky, bold, with a hard and very sexy cut; she is much better than this movie deserves. <br /> <br /> But this is IT. This boring suspense movie is a fragmented disaster, which seeks to be both a thriller stalker, a murder thriller, a story of loyalty and betrayal, and an erotic thriller. The film, my friends, is not at all exciting. <br /> <br /> For example, who thought to merge C. Thomas Howell as a desirable leader? It's not bad, but to shout loudly, it seems as if the goddess with Fiorentino's hard biscuits is doing it with a kindergarten teacher. Howell has neither the authority nor the presence on the screen to fill the leading role. <br /> <br /> The script is by far the worst aspect of the film. There is no tension, since the character of Fiorentino receives disturbing phone calls, there is no mystery about his guilt in the murders that are at the center of the film, there is no sense of liberation when Fiorentino complains of losing Howell inhibitions. <br /> <br /> Look for some interesting but poorly made cams by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes, and a really great sex scene between Howell and Florentine. Besides that, my first impulse would be to put this poor piece of trash down and go hire something else.
