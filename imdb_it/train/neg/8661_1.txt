the film looks as if the director was forced to make this film by some terrorist band. actually it should be called dino crap. <br /> <br /> there is nothing good about this movie .. even the actors are not worth a penny. don't waste time watching this movie. the director should be hit in the head to have the mentality to create such a bad film. I mean, aren't you ashamed to look at people's faces after watching your movie? the dinocroc seems to be done in power point and practically cut-and-paste. and it's the same old story. the man plays god creates a creature escapes and is happy to eat people. and finally a beautiful girl and a boy in a sleeveless shirt must come and kill him. bla bla .. you will discover the plot in the first 5 minutes of the film
