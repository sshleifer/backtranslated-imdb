Cannon has drawn a true visual beauty of a medieval epic that seems fascinating (except for the prop of dragon). Now, how did the long-established study for Chuck Norris's films create a total lack of knowledge in the first place? Case in point: amateur acting and the horrible plot are a sign that reviving the medieval legend is not a cure for a bad execution. Actually they went ahead and made another economic exploiter with hundreds of lustful bimbos, just to make this look even better. For the two "barbarian brothers", they surely know how to make strange noises that become brave warriors so strong and bold as to save their homeland. This is the biggest waste of potential I've seen from an "expensive" low budget movie, and so much worse to let an ax hit the stunning print without mercy. All this followed an advertising campaign that sold T-shirts based on THE BARBARIANS! The film is a great souvenir!
