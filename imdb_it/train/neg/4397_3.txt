One of my sister friends lent me this game, and it's too damn hard! It brings the look of a game for children, but you have to learn how to make tons of intricate moves that force you to twist and turn your hands in all kinds of awkward positions, and you have to look for seemingly endless levels for 100 notes, to improve your 'score'! You must also find these incredibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, which require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! AND I AM ONLY UNTIL THE THREE STAGE !!!!! Maybe if you don't have life and you can't stay at home all the time you could enjoy some fun, but otherwise keep away! AND IT IS NOT CERTAINLY RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - THEY WILL PERFORM THEIR HAIR INSIDE!
