This is not the cinema. It is not a talent. It's not informative It's not scary. It's not funny. It's nothing at all. <br /> <br /> I understood it because my cousin says: "Diablo! COOL!" Yeah, for sure. The only interesting thing about this experience is the solitary fact that I didn't buy it but rented it instead. <br /> <br /> It is shot as a bad soap opera. Do not wait. At least professional soap works LOOK ... sort of. This? Looks like it was shot on someone's video camera. It's horrible! Miserable! Sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is detestable! Who is this director anyway? I don't even care enough to watch it. THINKS! The performances of these poor unexpected actors have been far better than the deserved deserved ones. <br /> <br /> 2.6 / 10 on the "B" scale. <br /> <br /> Which records a 0.3 / 10 on the "A" scale from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
