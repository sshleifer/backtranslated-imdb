The beautiful Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, who dies after an ice angel crushes her before "I do's" with her boyfriend Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years Henry has yet to move on and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very worried. Chloe orders Henry to talk to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley has to contact Kate's spirit hoping to help Henry get on with his life. When the psychic begins to be attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost seems to crush the romance in the bud. There are some funny situations; but if you've seen the trailers you've seen the substance of the movie. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. I personally thought that Bell had stolen the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the ass. However this film was overwhelmed.
