The director states in the Behind-the-Scenes section that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the film to Dario Argento, as well as to other noteworthy directors like George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically dedicating this film to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh * t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CAST PEOPLE WHO CAN ACT. Also, don't throw a 40-year-old person for the role of an 18-year-old misunderstood recluse. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people watching their boyfriends tear out their hearts is fun. Or as a part when a boy is stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha understood), and his girlfriend says, "Oh ... my God?" The scarecrow itself is rather a character. Spin the cars and call the losers. <br /> <br /> The film has a saving factor ... oh wait, no it isn't. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely have to watch this movie, just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and has a really knotty song guy.
