OK, simple and simple, if you are a fan of the other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD) KEEP OUT OF LEGEND. <br /> <br /> It is, without a doubt, the most disappointing TR game. It looks very nice, it sounds very good, but it's totally unplayable and I gave up. I feel like I've been robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything else. Check Lara using the keyboard. In 6 Tomb Raider games the controls were standard. In AOD they were "sticky", but still the same general control sequences. In Legend they completely changed his methods of movement and control and she is totally uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments elsewhere from people who say "use the mouse". No why should I? Others say "Use a gamepad". No why should I? Others say "But this has been the standard for third-person checks for years." Well, I don't care, it's not the standard for any other TR game, so why joke with it. Oh, I know, because they couldn't care less about their original, loyal fan base, they want to cash in on new kids who hadn't even heard of the series until the movies came out and earned a lot more money. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> My advice to any TR fan is to keep me away from this game, and if you buy it, claim it at Eidos. I have seen masses of other posts, mainly on the Eidos forums, from people who tell them how much garbage is, maybe they will listen.
