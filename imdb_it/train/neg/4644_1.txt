This movie is terrible. The story is about a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The film struggles with its identity, oscillating from Noir / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown to a good extent. The film has a very confusing structure, for example with the frequent use of flashbacks without binding them in history. The plot is underdeveloped and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and who were playing. There are some implausibility in many films, but the scene in which the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home, then agrees to go upstairs alone (where he says he will find a phone), minus the gun he brought with him, call the police, it was too hard to believe. Part of the cinematography is very poor: we were watching on a 42 "television, so as anyone with a smaller set could understand what was happening in the scenes taken in an almost complete darkness is beyond me.
