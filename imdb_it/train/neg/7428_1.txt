As usual, on IMDb, majority voting rather than the "weighted average" is much more indicative of the entertainment value of the film. In this case, the majority gives him a "one". How right they are! To start my review, I will first admit that I am completely unaware of why this film is titled "Alien Intruder". It involves space and even an "alien" (I suppose), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything, in the long run, at least, no actual plot basis or resolution that I can understand anywhere. /> <br /> There are some scenes that are so atrocious (as regards both the lines, the times and the way they are pronounced), that far exceeds the strange feeling that is obtained by watching similar films really bad. I have no idea that part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be prey to something. <br /> <br /> The "plot" only concerns an area of ​​space known as G-Spot, I'm sorry, you make that G-Sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some sort of alien virus ( ?). I think it's alien since the image of the normal Ariel looks like a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, we see people shot with space weapons, falling from lofts and seemingly endless, useless close-up photos of "Where's Ariel?", "Can not find Ariel" (useless because most of the other shots INCLUDE the interaction with Ariel, however - anything) on ​​a computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits down and watches every fantasy of the prisoner's VR programs hoping to find this alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I lost something ... <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams gave some courses on "how to behave desperately" before shooting this. We know this because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers on his face and looking sad. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with the nose of a ship going to the back of the other was semi-fun at least, and provided for a laugh in addition to the first scenes in which we see several shots of the ship as it turns in a circle, resembling a Lego experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone dies in this movie, so why worry? Even VR girls are killed, as if that means something (especially because everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the money I save on spending, I will not want to spend my money back that I paid for the DVD of this. The dollar I saved on that vanilla wafer bag paid the time for this review. <br /> <br /> I add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with many more details added, could probably be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
