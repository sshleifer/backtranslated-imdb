I jumped at the chance to see this uncut, unbroken film, remembering rah and rave about it. But wherever he seemed about to slip into being really scary, he backed off and went somewhere else. The water that dripped throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, which took the wrong direction in raw sewage before they could reach a scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost expressionless face mask offered little but confusing disbelief, something that I found myself mirroring as the film consumed. What could have been a disturbing aboriginal song and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony apparently designed to beat terror in one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that aboriginal people believe that red-haired whites were the first priests, and many other possibilities have passed more like a shopping list than as a suggestion in another dimension ( the Time of the dream). br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, it was not clear to me what the director was trying to say. Is there a big wave? So? How big? A tsunami? Yes, OK. It is devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? It should be a big damn nice wave. Why? Was the world so ugly? It didn't seem so terrible in this movie. I didn't really think the wave came out, because the shadow left Burton's face that had been launched from the wave. Was it just the apocalypse of Burton? Heck, it happens every day to those who lose it. He was of no interest if it was just him. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton went to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking "Who are you?" and it gets really scary after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed suit.
