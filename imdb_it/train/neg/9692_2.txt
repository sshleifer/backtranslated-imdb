Bonjour Tristesse covers a terrain similar to "The Marriage Member". for example, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a loved family member and an intruder. While critics love "Marriage Member", I find that Julie Harris is a freak and an adenoidal and scenic teat in all that she has been. This portrays irritating and rich idiots like last year at Marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue. <br /> <br /> In this sequence of films by Preminger develop, but the characters do not. For the first 30 minutes he is content to confuse the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg cannot provide the depth required by the party. Kerr takes a stand and transforms the film into "Endless Love". Seberg's empty narrative is like something from Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really wish someone outside of Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing British Orthodox behavior in all his films, he never gets to the character. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable sequence, a night out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a port. Bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, "The Conformist". Kerr is on board to shake hands and portray another great pain (as in Black Narcissus, Night of the Iguana, King and I, Heaven Knows Mr. Allyson, Tea and Sympathy, etc. etc.). Really, Kerr was a horrible actress. I wish every movie with her could end in a fatal or even better car accident, start with one. <br /> <br /> People who are uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
