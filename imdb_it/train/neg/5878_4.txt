As the cover says "The village of our time, for our time". I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after seeing Keneth Branagh's version and it was really a disappointing experience. /> <br /> This version has a different approach to different aspects of the game, including sexuality; a very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think that for the time (1960s) this was a very well made version of Hamlet but it could not be compared to the full version of Branagh. <br /> <br /> just a note ... I found the video in my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if there's such a thing. If anyone knows one, please tell me.
