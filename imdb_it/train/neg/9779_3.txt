Inexorably stupid, budgetless "war image", made mainly to show the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer - not a bad idea in itself - but this should be embarrassing for all those connected with it. Ridiculous "script", shows that would not have been overcome in a Christmas parade of the elementary school, inept scenes of "action", confused direction of the usual documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen - who apparently is not entirely sure if he is doing a play a philosophical treatise on the uselessness of war or a cursed T & A (according to the standards of the '60s, however) travel diary of the magnificent body of Eve Meyer - and a general air of rudeness and incompetence. It's worth seeing to see Eve Meyer strive, but it's almost everything.
