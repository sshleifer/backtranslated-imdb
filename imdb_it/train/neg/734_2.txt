This film was shit with a capital "C". The opening scene showed promise. But that "promise" was interrupted shortly after the viewer learned where the plot is going. <br /> <br /> And the wooden statue, Morty, which was quite disturbing in the original film, seems a little stupid in this. He was so obviously just a boy in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks that "Morty" is one of the scariest names on the planet Earth? It sits directly there with "Jimmy" or "Fred" when it comes to horror value. The Henry-freakin'-wood statute - Kissinger "Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!" It would be as scary as "Morty". <br /> <br /> And then there's a scene where the hero hits his father's headstone with --- " a chewing hammer? "could you guess -" a two for four? "someone might venture out. No, he furiously beats up his father's headstone with a twig - a bizarre twig. Worse, once the characters move away, the tombstone actually, and inexplicably, bleeds Oh brother! <br /> <br /> There is also a native American boy who lives with the protagonist's grandparents, but apparently he does nothing except Morty-maintenance: perpetual the gruesome Morty-legends, warns those who mock and even fix Morty's arm when it is damaged during a sch childish, but despite all his respect and tenderness towards Morty, does Morty leave behind a hairy mouse? No. <br /> <br /> The film drags on, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real yawn. Don't rent it.
