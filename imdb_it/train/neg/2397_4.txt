Nicolas Roeg? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW no? Strangely, the aforementioned film was broadcast on the BBC television over the weekend that made the screening of COLD HEAVEN tonight in favor of what ever. <br /> <br /> You see that it is impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON'T WATCH NOW as they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they also had the same plot, except that a dead husband had been replaced instead of a dead child, in fact my mind was set in this film that revolved around an afflicted widow seeing her dead husband run around Venice wearing a red anorak. This does not happen but about a third of the execution time is a huge twist and although it is an essential twist it is not explained in any great depth. In fact, COLD HEAVEN is explained very little that ruins the film <br /> <br /> People have mentioned the rather low production values ​​of COLD HEAVEN and it is impossible not to notice them. If I had not done otherwise I would have thought it was a TVM since it was created for television up to white capital letters in the title sequence. Roeg also tries to inject artistic pretensions through spoken thought processes, but again this does not help the film at all. You can't help but feel that Roeg should have put all his effort into the twists and turns that are completely flat-screen <br /> <br /> Economic production values, selfless direction and really bizarre premises and scripts for a bad movie
