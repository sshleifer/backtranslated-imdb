I still can't believe how bad this movie was. If I weren't a slayer, I don't know if I would have survived the vision. It seems to cost around $ 1000, but it wasn't the money that killed them. The acting was horrible, not only bad, the 3rd grade could have read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason to watch this type of film is the skin, and this is seriously lacking in this film. We can't even see the most attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Ahh well, better luck next time, eh?
