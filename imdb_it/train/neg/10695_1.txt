... Ok, I've read about this movie somewhere on the Internet, and many have criticized the way the movie was bad and sucks. And I couldn't have agreed more on this. Then, after watching this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it and then I came to advertise this movie on TV. Fortunately I saved my money for these shit pieces. My sleep was sacrificed for this film and it was soon discovered that this film could not satisfy me. So I can't judge how the film was made, but still ... it still sucks. As for those who liked this film, I would apologize for inflaming this film and for telling how lousy this film is. I don't know what you think of this movie?
