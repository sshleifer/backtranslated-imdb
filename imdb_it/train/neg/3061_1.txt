This movie is terrible. Give me the dentist at any time! Can you believe that one of the major television stations here in Arabia has had this as their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowd with Dudley Moore rather than this one. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle, it had more acting, better plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Don't even look at it if you're drunk!
