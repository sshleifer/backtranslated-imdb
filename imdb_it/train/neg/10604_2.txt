This time the hero of the first film became human and this time he uses fist and foot combos against super-universal soldiers and a computer that went wrong and is ready to take on the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team, which convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing actionable movies. However it was this that tarnished his credibility forever. While Universal Soldier: The Return isn't as boring as Double Team or The Quest, it's still pretty awful, with no original style or style and no star match. This sequel is simply done for children who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, even the action sequences have not been so exciting and so this film is a real disaster. In other words, another clunker in the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (Bad)
