Camp Blood III is a huge improvement on Camp Blood II because it played mostly in the right places and in a rudimentary plot. This time they ventured a little farther from the parking lot, where the other two films were shot, which is a good move because you no longer hear the cars pass in front of what should be a remote nature. <br /> <br /> This time there is a reality show and a fake clown to scare the competitors. This is certainly not a new idea, I saw at least three other horror films with the same premise in which the real killer is, but at least this one has a plot instead of being stabbed at random with a knife. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this is at least good for some laughter. I liked how there is a firearm sound effect when someone is stabbed in the beginning and how the boom microphone hovers behind people like a ghost. <br /> <br /> I don't know why anyone would want to do a third Camp Blood movie, I would have thought it would be better to start over but at least they tried it with this. The deformed half-naked woman was a bit too much for me, it seems they tried to maintain continuity by taking on some maniacs who would take off their clothes for $ 5 just like in the second movie. They have not yet figured out that a machete is used to cut not stabbed, but oh, well, it's a Camp Blood movie what do you expect? If you like shit movies, you'll have a blast.
