(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I saw this film with extremely low expectations, and I can unfortunately inform you that the film hardly lived it. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked seeing Janne "Loffe" Karlsson on the big screen, the writers should have realized at the beginning of the screenplay process that seven people fell into the water, not original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, those that are not, are simply boring. I smiled three times during the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The positioning of Findus's Swedish products is (unintentionally) fun, because not just a big sign that says, "Findus made it happen!". GÃ¶ta Kanal 2 does not need to be seen in the cinema or on DVD, just waiting for it to be broadcast on TV, it won't take long.
