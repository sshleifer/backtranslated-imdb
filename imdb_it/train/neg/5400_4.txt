This is a full blown gore festival based on a story by Stephen King. Two tabloid journalists, one seasoned (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so accomplished (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. More strange than strange, this modern bloodsucker does not naturally lead the way, but by means of a black Cessna he looks for his victims. The gore gets really creepy as the movie approaches its stupid ending. Keep in mind that Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I must admit that it is a bit scary in the early hours of the night.
