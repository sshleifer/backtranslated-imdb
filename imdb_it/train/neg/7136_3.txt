"A total waste of time" It is enough to launch some explosions, relentless fighting, an unbalanced millionaire's exotic cars, computer crashes in slow motion and, last but not least, a character like Hugh Hefner with sexy wall-to-wall girls mix a blender and you'll have this sorry excuse for a movie. I really took a laugh from "Dr. Evil" as a heavily fortified compound. The plot was somewhere between absurd and non-existent. How many millionaires are willing to make a $ 25 million bet on a car race? Answer: 4 but, haven't they become millionaires through fiscal responsibility? This was written for pubescent males, playing as a video game. Anyway, I liked the landing of Gulfstream II in the desert.
