Well, this movie is incredibly horrible. I was sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they didn't write their lines. That they were sometimes delivered with a slight sarcasm, which led me to believe that they weren't taking this movie seriously, or anyone looking at this hateful home run. While watching this "unknown creature" I couldn't help but think that there wasn't much of a budget or a competent writer for the crew. But if you go and watch this for a laugh you'll be happy, the movie is cheeky to make fun of itself because I don't see how anyone can watch it and be proud to pump this straight to the clich√© DVD wants to be an action thriller / horror film fightfest in the light.
