A plot that has lost its breath and smelled of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judicial disaster with a pro-life side and the other a destroyer of the seed of a demon. The horror was left out and replaced by a general boring effect, probably destined to be horrible, but instead showed a bad dose of beliefs that were ridiculed to death, despite the title itself. Being a Masters of Horror fan from the start, this ridiculous twist with his sordid depictions crashed like an old rocking chair after he was seated. I consider this episode as if it had been thrown together since the beginning, never taking off anywhere else but seeing it for what it is its value and relieved when it finally arrived at "The End" ..
