This show is just annoying !!! I'm sorry for the actors for trying to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laugh tries to cover up the sad jokes and the song "Awwww" comes in the most useless moments. Children who are too dramatic are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Moreover, this show is cliché city. If you were to search for the word cliché, you would read "Full House". Each plot has a "life lesson" to learn at the end. A cheesy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most snotty child a sudden realization of GASP goodness, too bad that this is not possible in real life. I don't know how anyone can watch this show without questioning the behavior of the characters or the laughter. I find myself shouting on the TV saying: "THAT IS NOT FANTASTIC / SAD / CUTE" If life were really so, the world would collapse.
