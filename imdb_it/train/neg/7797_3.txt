This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, but I want to say that some of the criticisms I heard turned out to be unjustified. <br /> <br /> As for the pure film production technique this director is competent He is held back by the limited budget and the VHS camera, but the editing, camera angles, camera movements and scene are very professional . I have seen many films where the "direction" was much worse. At least the scenes flow in a way that is not confusing and has some clever shots here and there. Furthermore, the forest scenes contained a decent atmosphere. There is only so much you can do with a VHS camera, and it does a good job regarding the technical aspects. As for artistic merit, there is none. The scene in which the camera turns off so you can watch a boy urinating in the woods for 15 seconds somehow sums up the artistic style of the entire film. This is pure garbage ... Total garbage. <br /> <br /> Blood is a decent film for a film in this budget range. , obviously it's fake, but there's a lot of it, and it's very extravagant .. <br /> <br /> I saw the American version with intentionally campy dubbing. This was a good idea (and that's the only thing that allowed me to get through the film) ... Unfortunately, it's over the top, especially towards the end. <br /> <br /> It's really a terrible movie, but I have to recommend it for the value of the field. It is really difficult to find a film that is worse than this and that puts it in a unique category.
