Cheezy action movie with Dolph Lungren. Lungren is a military man who once retired in a teaching job. But the changes in the neighborhood and in the student body left him frustrated and decides he will hang it. Things get difficult when you look at a group of detained students that some thieves take to the school as a base for an armored car robbery. His Dolph against the bad guys in a fight to the death. Bouncing open-mouthed at the late grindhouse's exploitative films, where the bad clothes of punk and some of the nasty women had bright hair. What a stupid movie. I can't believe people have done this kind of thing, this is an action movie that was probably condemned from the beginning before the tight budget, the false separatist ensembles and the poor direction of the action were even a glitter in the eye of the producers. Look how late in the film as the cars go through the school (don't ask) crash into the security tower (don't ask because it looks more like a prison than a high school) and destroy its barely built shape (it doesn't seem to have it done in previous shots). What did the gods of bad movies do? I've actually been puzzled since he was directed (?) By Sydney J Furie, a very good director who made films like The Boys in Company C. He lost his ability, or was so desperate from the start and not did he even worry about it? It's a turkey. Nevertheless, but a watchable turkey.
