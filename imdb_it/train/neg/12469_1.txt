I rarely give up on a movie without seeing the whole show. This is especially true when I rented it on DVD. Syriana was the one I surrendered to. Halfway, I turned it off with a bored disgust. <br /> <br /> This film is disjointed, boring, confused and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portraits. The general plot was good, but developed so insipid and boring that I could not get my attention or interest. Often the multiple substations could not connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than a true connected plot. Too bad that such a serious subject and such great actors can create such a flop. I can't imagine that this film receives nominations, much less a prize.
