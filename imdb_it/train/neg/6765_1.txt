* Spoilers * Some argue that Natural Born Killers is a brilliant criticism of media obsession with violence. But this contention ignores the real content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious and inhuman murderers of innocent people and thwarted this with a morbid media fascination. Instead he lends him the justification. The film shows almost all the victims as someone who deserved to be hurt. By engaging in vicious stereotypes, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - mute tumblers, English immigrants who speak ill, lazy and fat people. The only person that homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course they make friends with the old, hallucinogenic, using American Indians - why am I fashionable, man? Let's make him an admirable character. Fats, Chinese employees and "hicks" are not refined, so let's make it look like you deserve to die. Instead of twisted, hateful who are corrupted by their misdeeds, their fury makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and fantastic and surreal images are designed to attract more impressionable people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are described as brutal, ugly and frowning compared to the GQ killers. Again, this is not in the media reports within the film, but in the "reality" of the film. There are no nuances or subtleties in the film - only exaggerated shows and images. The film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. The proof that the film fails in its message lies in the actual reactions of the real world to it. Some impressionable young people who have seen this film have cited it as a source of inspiration for the murders they committed. The "message" of the film is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous results of real life. The intelligent message is nowhere to be seen.
