The film begins with the promise, but lingers too long in a sepia world of distance and alienation. We remain hanged, but with nothing but save languid strokes of serious and thoughtful male faces to savor. Certainly no rope on the wall to help us climb over. It is a pity, because the concept is not without merit. <br /> <br /> We have to wonder why an affectionate couple - father and son no less - should be so foreign to the real world that they prefer their world when they are claustrophobic beyond imagination. This loss of presence in the real world is, quite clearly and unnecessarily, in contrast to the fact that the son joined the armed forces. Why not the circus, so can we at least appreciate a little color? We are left with a sense of spasmodic loss, but unfortunately no lighting, which is disconcerting given that the film is apparently on some form of achievement not available to all of us.
