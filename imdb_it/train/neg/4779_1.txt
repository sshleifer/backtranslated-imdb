In 2004, I liked it. Then he became very stupid. It suggests that children have no brain. Insult children. Cartoon Network was great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. He managed to be interesting and imaginative in his approach to children's programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 tablespoons of sugar into your Sprite. It seems that today's TV producers are only interested in making money, instead of engaging in children's imagination and making money! Lately, my children are tuning in to the old shows (1960s) to find something interesting to watch. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television to look at its past and recycle the programming of children of other times.
