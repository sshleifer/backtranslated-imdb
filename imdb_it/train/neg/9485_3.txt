As others have taken the trouble to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this film. There may be spoilers here; I don't care enough to filter them. <br /> <br /> - Due to the film's low budget, the creatures' design was quite good. It is actually nice to see a horror movie directed at the video that is not embellished with terrible CGI. Unfortunately the quality of the digital film is rather grainy in some places, and is more evident in the well-lit white rooms of the asylum. <br /> <br /> - The ridiculous design of light affects parts of this film, not to mention the variations over time. I understand that the director could have tried to simulate dementia, but to be effective it is necessary to establish a constant time flow. As it stands, it looks simply amateurish. <br /> <br /> - Twists have been numerous but constantly predictable. I had no doubt in my mind of the identity of the pot-bellied lovers, nor of the fact that a sort of lame wicked-trump - a good development would have surfaced in the end. <br /> <br /> - This may sound quibbling, but the characters in this movie can't reliably use any kind of common sense. First of all, the regulatory commissions would be everywhere in a mental health center that unilaterally declared all deaths for patients and employees caused by cardiac arrest. Why should the chief psychiatrist be able to perform autopsies? Why was it not a point of the plot made of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his strange choice of religion? What is the background? What should make us worry about someone in this? And just as importantly, who, in their right mind, went through the introduction to the place, saw all that was so terribly wrong with it, and then concluded that it was still a nice place to look for a residence? This film has not even respected his characters enough to give their intelligence the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br /> In conclusion: see The Wicker Man.
