I wanted to believe in this film after the only mainstream form of comedy that this country recognizes is slapstick and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Of course, it went completely the other way - we're cool and edgy - and we came out the other side with little to show for it. I bet One Small Seed went crazy for this. I know that SL did it. <br /> <br /> None of the main characters have the comic ribs to make it. Danny K also had better timing. I'm actually serious. Every time they introduced a character a bit I kept thinking, "Damn, this person should have been the protagonist!" <br /> <br /> Independent does not mean that the camera work should be horrible. Black and white has done nothing for this film - in reality with such a flat dialogue this has wounded even more by bringing boredom into sharp relief. Even the black and white was not clear. The composition was horrible. The use of music was horrible. Strangely, I watched Little Miss Sunshine after this movie and the composition was superb - maybe that's why the shortcomings in this film come to mind. <br /> <br /> I think Corne (who was more fun than the lead before he said anything) was talking about this movie and not David - watch it and you'll understand. I bet the guys who organize Oppikoppi were dismayed. One might think that nothing happens. I had the feeling that it could have been shot in someone's garden. I know normal guys who have more fun conversations, raunchier and wittier than all these "comics". The guy they lined up with was OK. <br /> <br /> The Guess SA comedy will remain a little longer in the Stone Age. Nice work guys.
