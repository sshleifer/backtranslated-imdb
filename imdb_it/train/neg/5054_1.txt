We know that firefighters and rescuers are heroes: a suitable vision that few could challenge. The friends and family of these and others who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center could be touched by this vapid game filmed. A sweet, serious fireman, even if tied to a language, remembers what a lost colleague can be to an undecided journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. Reflect on results. He mumbles some more, composes another eulogy, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> The terrible events that caused the need for several thousand praises are terribly sad, but this dramatic and insipid dramatization is boringly boring.
