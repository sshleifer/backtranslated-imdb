Without an effective indulgence of the supernatural or of the motivating poetic nuances of humanity, this whole creative team must hope for an effective use of its mediocre and non-original elements. The "party of five" has become manic and therefore genetically inevitable, but there is little interest in rooting because the singular non-homicidal element is a mopester of Wes Bentley, insignificant and insignificant. In fact, all the acting is profound. Although dark-haired women appeal, salacity is minimized. No nudity here. We also lack sufficient buckets of blood. All the sensations are kept in a joke, at a safe distance ... an unfortunate fact considering the name given by the directors is "butcher". Only the soundtrack, the fluctuating distressing and the tense and fluctuating score provide a palpable tension. Sometimes some compositions with static storyboards add captivating low angles that add to the malaise ... but for a film that calls itself horror, I didn't even get close to a jolt once. Perhaps a greater emphasis on the rejuvenation of society through the taking of blood, direct scenes with different geometric shapes outside the square, and a constant attention to the playfulness through the wickedness of the family or traps that investigators must escape to escape their dilemma would have improved my opinion, but this was not a good start for my horrorfest excursion.
