Wow ... where to start ... I picked it up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. There are three dollars I will never see ... never ... and for what? I'll tell you An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and college angst that seemed more suited to a Lifetime movie than the horror film advertised on stage. (May the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for eternity). Follow him with a bit of cold blood (you don't even care ...) and a twist at the end that comes out of nowhere, and it doesn't make sense. Terrible, terrible, horrible ... <br /> <br /> Were there any qualities of salvation? Well, on the scale of Joe Bob Briggs, there were six breasts involved, but it wasn't worth having them lost by three dollars. Without them, this could have been on Sci-Fi at, say, two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
