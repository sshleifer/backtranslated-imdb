And when I look at Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love the bizarre and irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so damn B-O-R-I-N-G, annoying and yawning. Moreover, it is totally devoid of anything humorous. The impassive way he tries to deliver his lines just died on arrival because it's not funny at all. I saw two segments of his program and I was ready for Novocaine. <br /> <br /> Geez, my son (19) saw his Comedy Central promos and said he was a "stupid girl". I thought it was a compliment. What he says "Watch my show or kill my dog" is actually believable. I know you want to be a comedian. You come across a deformed nut box. I never want to see her around my dog.
