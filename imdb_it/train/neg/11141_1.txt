Friend, this movie sucked great! I wasn't even able to see the hole thing (my girlfriend did though). Really bad acting, computer animations so ugly that you laugh (werewolf woman), strange clips, the list could go on and on. I don't know if it's just me or this movie reminds you of a porn movie? And I don't mean all naked girls ... It's something about light or something ... This could become a classic just because of bad acting and all naked women, but not because it's an original white film nice twist. My last words are: don't see it! It's not worth it. If you want to see it because nudity there are many better to see!
