It was not exceptional. Not terrible or hateful or anything else, just forgettable. <br /> <br /> He had a kind of humid, hesitant, diluted air, as if he had never known whether he wanted to laugh or out of sweetness or satire. So we were left with a weak mix of the three. The actors seemed a little lost. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified. How often do we have to say that the 1950s in the United States have been infected by a trivial sense of conformity? And was this perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And is that emotional repression in men a baaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> <br /> His biggest crime in my eyes, however, was detached from reality. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in a complete movie in which you have to keep an audience's interest for a prolonged period - you still need a sort of emotional anchor, a related guide through history, to make it engaging. For the "hero" boy to look at an old woman, two schoolmates and finally his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and to greet him with a cheerful smile and a shrug, then I only fight for deal with it in any positive way. Mom was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman at that level, you risk losing yourself and this is what happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that kind of apple pie periphery and it caught it pretty well, it was a good movie, especially some of those corner shots of the street and inside the Robinson house. Also, the opening newsreel was nice, in a way done before, but still fun. <br /> <br /> And I thought that Billy Connolly was OK and that he came from someone who is not a big Billy Connolly fan: Movie Star. I just had this fear that was about to be picked up and trying to steal every scene, but he played quite simply for him and probably the cutest character in the whole film came out. <br /> <br /> All in all, not exceptional though.
