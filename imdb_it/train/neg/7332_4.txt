Despite being a 2001 film, the direction is the art-house style genre of the 90s that was considered "old" and obsolete a few years ago. The cuts and effects of cheese were painful to watch. The script is pretty decent and some scenes fascinated me (like when the taxi driver takes her on the bridge at night). But the plot with the detective that his sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was simply terrible. The performance of the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. However, I witnessed the whole thing, which is rare for the type of casual film, what is this film that you find on TV and you decide to watch.
