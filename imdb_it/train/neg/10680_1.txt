SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films ever made - it's so simple. There is no redeemable quality for this film. The first 10 minutes are quite complicated: in reality they lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will make you sit on the edge of your seat. Instead, you'll spend 83 minutes punching while watching the stolen and poorly made scenes without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, it looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. The characters show their advanced teleportation powers, such as Alex Thomas who falls into the lake (drunk) and ends up on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon performed a pitiful performance like Kate, compounded by the space-time interruption dialogue that seems to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grade student. An example of this would be when she said "Torch!" in such a stupid way as to show the threshold of how much a human body can shudder before shooting in half. Finally, the editing of this film was by far the most bizarre and horrible I've ever seen. It was as if the cameramen were a group of chimpanzees who had received video cameras from scientists. An example of this would be when you suddenly get a close-up of the headlight on Alex's car. I bet there was very little time spent editing this film. The ending was absolutely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create a sort of mysterious plot that made the viewer say, "oh yes!" Instead, we are left to see some dumb paintings of a spider that somehow fits into the plot. Unfortunately, there is no prospect in the millions out there that can save this movie from being a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Give this to .5 out of 10, being the .5 from the fact that this film was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book.
