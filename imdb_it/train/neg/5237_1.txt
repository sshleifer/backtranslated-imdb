One of, if not the worst film released by Britain in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This gruesome story of a middle-aged lecher who "seduces" two teen scrubbers babysitting for him and his fake wife has nothing to redeem. <br /> <br /> In turn free, childish, crude and unrealistic, this film probes the depths while failing miserably in its attempts to be fun, provocative, intellectual and controversial. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the worst thing about this movie is the way the cast of George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched together by such a nasty script. Not surprisingly, this was Andrea Dunbar's last work to make it appear on screen. Complete and total rubbish at all levels.
