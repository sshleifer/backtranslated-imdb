This film has an interesting plot, but the acting is pretty ugly and the script is poor. I was very disappointed. The moral dilemma faced by the main character is intriguing, but due to bad writing and casting this potentially winning premise is looted. 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 laughed at how bad the movie was. I brought it to the end, but I have to admit that I played Blackjack on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable.
