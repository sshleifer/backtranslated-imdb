1993 was the year. This happened long before Phillip Seymour Thomas won an Oscar. Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him? Actually, I was paid extra in "My Boyfriend's Back", which was shot in a suburb of Austin called Georgetown, TX. The original title was "Johnny Zombie" (thank God the producers changed their mind!) I was in the theater scene. I rushed to watch the movie the day it came out in theaters. It's more a comedy than a horror movie. But ... for a good laugh, you might want to check. Nothing like the "Dawn of the Dead" quality or even "Shaun of the Dead", but the cheese factor is pretty good. Hello
