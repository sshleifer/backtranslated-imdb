How low can someone sink while trying to regain an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing what has been done for a good Star Trek show, DO NOT watch it. <br /> <br /> Writing is hodge-podge, the representations of the actors of their weak characters, and above all, the design work is decidedly cagnatory. <br /> <br /> Like watching the strong captains, don't look here! How the strong attitude of the Federation? Forget it here! Starfleet is mocked by midshipmen wearing Spikes in their hair. <br /> <br /> While an apparently weak captain mentally shuffles and within two minutes of the show's titles, Ensign Spikey is attempting to organize an audition with an engineer. It degrades from there. No, not even the uniforms correspond, for heaven's sake. They are too small or too big, collars up to the chest and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed with the uniforms of the third and second series. The strict discipline and tradition of all the originals in the absence of this production up to the steps! The only positive thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a little in every season. OK, I'll get it back. Who uses the CG in an inexperienced way? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about it, it will offend your sense of Star Trek, as mine did. Not even backtracks to previous shows can save this catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I saw this, probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head was almost broken. So bad.
