I gave this horror comic film with a ridiculous title 2 because it contains several famous porn stars of the past. A group of tourists, presumably on holiday in Ireland, but actually in Canada, clash with an inanimate cannibal mutant, or something similar, and the plot is more or less directly from THE HILL HAVE THE EYES AND THE WRONG. The only problem is that, unless it has been badly counted, there is only one mutant on display, and it is not that impressive. A kind of bellied mummy in that home-made film about five years ago. Some bloody but stupid deaths help, but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond imagination. The ending is predictable and was done to death. No pun intended.
