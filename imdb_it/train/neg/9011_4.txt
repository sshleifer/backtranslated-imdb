Pretty standard B movie stuff. Seriously, anyone watching "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a group of people making their first film should know better than to expect real quality or moderate intelligence. B movies exist to rework the formulas that are popular. If you also give them a symbolic analysis, you'll end up ruining the movie (and maybe write some self-important and defamatory reviews on IMDb). I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. He had charisma and I thought he was remarkably attractive. It was a memorable appearance in B-movie. Unfortunately, I don't see where he's made any films since. I'll watch it again.
