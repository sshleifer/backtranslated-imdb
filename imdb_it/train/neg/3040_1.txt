With a title like this, you know you have a lot of junk. Behave badly Script badly. Bad manager. Bad grammar. <br /> <br /> Films make a lot of noise that in reality is not music and many are screaming. Movies make bad racial stereotypes. Why does every movie with black hero have drug addicts? Why does the hero always have to dance to succeed? Why would the famous rapper always have to be in the dance movie? Why can't the letter "s" be in the title? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs to stop the stupid public and make films that have people with brains who know how to speak proper English. <br /> <br /> Do yourself the favor and don't go see.
