Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we're almost interested in them. However there are some real problems with the story here, we see no real motivation for the behavior of the evil brother, and the time line is ruined. Presumably set in 1963, the music is late 60s / early 70s. References and dialogue are from the 70s / 80s. The potential for a powerful climax occurs, and Penn allows it to slip away. But even with all these difficulties it is worth looking at, but not exceptional.
