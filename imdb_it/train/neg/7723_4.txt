Well, I couldn't even enjoy this movie much for its cult values. It is an action movie from the B series film by the director of "Commando", which is still too flattered and foolish to consider it a good B series movie with enough entertainment value. <br /> <br /> It is a film from the 90s, but above all the film should remember an action movie from the 1980s, when these types of B-movies were at the highest levels. These films have always gone beyond the lines and never paid much attention to his story or acting. It was all about blowing up stuff, big muscle heroes and bullets flying around. This film contains all the ingredients, but I didn't really enjoy watching this movie as much as I like watching movies like that. Hard to say why really, since history, acting and so on are just as bad as they would be in virtually every other genre film of the same era. <br /> <br /> It is probably because the film is often far too silly. All these types of movies have their own stupid moments but this movie is just full of it. The fight, Dolph Lundgren running without a shirt, the characters, the story. This is not very good because it is often too weak for words. Is history sometimes not even trying to make sense and what is also the main plot of the film? His story is everywhere and seems to be written only to create a film with combat sequences, gunfights and the like. And those sequences are not even very nice to see really. The moments are too short and disappointing to really look at the man who brought us "Commando". <br /> <br /> It is above all a Dolph Lundgren, in which he plays the great star of the hero, who punches with apparently relative ease, knows how to handle guns and other weapons and, of course, also gets the girl, played by Tia Carrere. All this also brings us one of the worst editing sequences in the history of the action film and certainly one of the worst sexual sequences I've seen in each film. Both are too lousy for words and put together badly. <br /> <br /> None of the characters really work. Good guys are cops but they never seem to act like one of them. They simply kill without facing anyone's responsibility and are not very enthusiastic about arrests or informing anyone of their findings. Not even when they discover that a large Japanese criminal union is trying to conquer the streets of L.A. and a beer brewery is working as a cover for a large-scale drug and drug smuggling factory. And just think about it for a moment, what is the general purpose of Brandon Lee in the film? The film could easily have been made without him and also with the girl. <br /> <br /> Too stupid, lame and simplistic and simply not funny enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
