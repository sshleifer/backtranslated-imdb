I just got back from the movie and I'm completely horrified. This film is a real joke to all humanity. The theater I was in maybe had 4 other people. This film was recommended to me and I could not believe that this person liked it. I can't believe any healthy human would like it. There was no plot NO PLOT AT ALL. It was a joke. How can you make a film about nothing. This film only goes to show why Hollywood is in such chaos. I can only watch the spiral of the "horror film" industry and giggle. That parody to all the directors, this is true for all the new "teen horror films" Grudge, Boogeyman, Ring, Saw series. It's all so junk. Don't support this kind of nonsense!
