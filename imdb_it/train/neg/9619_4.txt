If you can believe it, * another group of teenagers returns to * another * cabin on the lake three years later * another * one of those fatal accidents claimed one of their numbers. Low and behold, a psychopath wearing a decorated hockey mask (a cheap paper one on that) turns around to waste them one by one. This mechanical "Friday 13" knockout has gained some notoriety as one of the first digitized feature films, but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable amateur production with sub-par performance and a recurring boom-microphone intrusion . A last-second turn does little to lift spirits, and "Memorial Day" is something better thrown into a lake and forgotten. Only one for the crowds of slasher collectors.
