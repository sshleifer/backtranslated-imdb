I just finished watching American Pie: Beta House and I have to say this was a bunch of garbage. The first 3 American Pies were hilarious, the last 3 were a joke and should not have been called American Pie. <br /> <br /> As you understood from the title of the film, Beta House, speaks of a fraternity, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of all, falling in love. Obviously, the boy who has his way with chicks is Stifler, who, together with his companions, tries to complete another seemingly impossible task. It was unrealistic and super fake. It's really predictable and the plot is so weak. Both parts of the college challenge each other to see who gets it all (something like that). To sum up: terrible acting + boring script + improper use of the American Pie franchise = total waste of time! This film is unbearable. I gave it a two out of ten, although most of it was sucked into nudity and pretty girls, like 2 funny scenes :)
