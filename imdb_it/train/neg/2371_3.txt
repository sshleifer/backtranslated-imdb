I'm not a big fan of Freddy Krueger, but that doesn't mean that I don't like Robert Englund and the other Nightmare films on Elm Street. I think Robert is a great actor. No one plays better than Freddy Krueger of Ma, without offense Robert, this film sucked. The acting is terrible, the plot is really weak, and Freddy Krueger is the only part of the cast that is worth watching. Sometimes the sequel can be better than the first, like Friday the thirteenth franchise (I thought the remake was the best in the series.) But this is not one of those films. The original was good, the second in my opinion was better, the third was ok but I didn't see the others. Whatever you do, don't make the same mistake I did looking at this piece of shit.
