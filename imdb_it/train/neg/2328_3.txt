I saw it recently and I must say that I was touched by the factual basis of the story. However, "Holly" as a film did not work. However, I can't wait to watch the documentary made by the producers who organized this project because I think it would have been a much more compelling work than this film. <br /> <br /> The international cast was composed of B- class actors but their acting was appropriate, and I have to make a special mention for the young actress who played Holly. This was his first film role and he did a great job considering that his is the hardest part. <br /> <br /> Ron Livingston was as adequate but insipid as Patrick, the American whose search is to "save" Holly, but Chris Penn was good at that, his final role. Unfortunately, despite my predominantly favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were completely forgettable and did not do their best work in this film. I believe in the message and the intention of the film, but I have to be honest, so I consider "Holly" 3 stars based on its flaws as a movie. But I think the topic deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this film have made a documentary that I hope will have its debut on the BBC and other television networks.
