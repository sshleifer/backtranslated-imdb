Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome directed by a film student idolizing John Woo and getting "Power Play". The idea was good, but the execution, the acting and the dialogue absolutely killed him, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and sequences of disasters that were used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the most interesting parts of the film. > <br /> This is the story of a journalist who investigates the disappearance of three members of a group of guerrilla activists who mysteriously disappeared after escaping to the offices of a power plant suspected of causing an earthquake frenzy. The unprejudiced reporter, who rails against what should have been a group of ruthless company executives, is chased around the city (along with anyone who talks about it) in order to "clean up" any definitive evidence that plant flaws remain. br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with great hesitation, accompanied by idiotic dialogues and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention the viewer, who can only be attracted to the film because of its action-genre appeal, is forced to endure a growing number of corpses and ridiculous amounts of violent shootings plus seismic disaster scenes. The whole focus was put in the wrong place to make up for apologizing for the lack of direction and for the most interesting sequence of events that should have pushed the story. It could have been much better if the directors focused more on a thriller and paid more attention to the development of the corruption aspects of this story. Gruesome rogues, a naive reporter and those trying to warn the reporter of the fake standing. It's terrific, but at least it would have been fun.
