The whole thing is very nice to look at ... the recovery in Europe was a good idea. The main actors are attractive. The score is useful. <br /> <br /> BUT THEN THEY SPEAK! And the undeveloped plot! And it was all downhill from there. Pacino is a sleepwalker and Keller continues to talk about how bored she is ... hello dear, you're not alone. When you do an imitation of Mae West, you may have to hide your face, it's so painful to watch. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how the actor or director Sydney Pollack was involved, or rather question, why did it go wrong? <br /> <br /> Because death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you should have some fun here. Perhaps he should feel as empty and cold as death. But I can't recommend it yet.
