As we all know, Hollywood loves to change historical events around our entertainment, and 44 minutes is one of those Hollywood movies. For example, bank robbers never returned to the bank when they started filming at LAPD, but in the film we see them come back twice! Another example is the number of Los Angeles police officers who were shot towards the end of the film, this is far from the truth! But obviously Hollywood must have a nice bloody finish so * add * a little more blood and courage. Some events have been combined and many of the main actors have played different people, but this is what Hollywood has always done, why complain? I guess the only sad part is that I saw some one-hour documentaries on the North Hollywood shooting on TLC that were so much better than that!
