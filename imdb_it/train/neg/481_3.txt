Whenever a film is so short-sighted in its desire to present a particular ending or point of view that simply doesn't care about a true story, it's annoying. Those are the types of films in which the ending or point of view is conceived first, and the story was simply followed. For this reason we often talk about the story "jumping circles" while twisting, trying in vain to advance to the preordained end in a logical way. <br /> <br /> The story of "Comet Over Broadway" I do nothing but skip the circles, it's a three-ring circus. It is so ridiculous, so ill-conceived, so dishonest that if you are inclined to speak aloud on the screen, you will continue to talk about a real momentum before it is over. <br /> <br /> The central theme of this script the cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since it's all so horribly confusing, it will end up offending people of both opinions. So, in the end the story doesn't make sense, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as often happens with poor screenplays, acting doesn't save anything.
