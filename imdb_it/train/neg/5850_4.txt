Nell Shipman attempted a plot to lead to a chase finale in "Back to the Land of God" of the previous year, and failed miserably. This time, she does better, even if it seems useless. 'Something New' hardly has a plot that lies outside the hunt. There is a brief introduction, which sets the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) to save the girl (played by Shipman), so it's nothing but an exciting and implausible chase from there. Sure, it sounds like a one-hour commercial for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is ridiculously ridiculous. He doesn't seem to have learned much from D.W.'s last-minute rescue movies Griffith or his parodies of Mack Sennett and other comedians, which he is imitating. <br /> <br /> A point of interest is that Shipman writes and orients himself in the film as a scriptwriter of the film's history, which has as its protagonist a writer (Shipman again), although she doesn't do much else clever or funny with it, even if you try to do it. Again, others had experienced the writer's line in the captions, like Anita Loos with "Wild and Woolly" or Frances Marion with "A Girl's Folly" (both from 1917). At least, Shipman gives the impression of not taking himself or the film seriously - and neither do I. "Something new", despite its claims, is trite.
