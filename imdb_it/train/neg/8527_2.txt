There are three films with this style of animation that I remember fondly from my youth. This film, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit". I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and have not seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. It was until today and now I wish I hadn't done it. What bothered me most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often alienated. Things would have happened for no reason and other things would have happened without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here; we are talking about the key points of the plot! The story itself is not so nice to begin with, but it could have worked if the script had been decent. Not even close. Also, the music was terrible! I know that music in films like these rarely has what could be called a classic song, but the music in this film made me want to lose myself with a bowling ball. This was one of those movies that I would one day show to my children, but it has just been cut. I don't think I could ever attend that shit party again. Disappointed is putting it slightly.
