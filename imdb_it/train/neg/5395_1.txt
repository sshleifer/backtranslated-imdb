Kenneth Branagh attempts to turn the shady comedy rarely produced by William Shakspeare into a 1930s musical, with the result of being both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy, given that actors are rarely skilled in one or the other of the two styles and in some cases squirming badly in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to have the impression of being utterly hysterical like Costard but who is seriously mistaken, and Alicia Silverstone who runs Shakespearean language with all the authority of a Valley Girl teenager who is reading the script to high voice in her middle school English class. <br /> <br /> The musical numbers are staged with the experience of a high school production of "Dames at Sea", leaving the seemingly awkward and amateur cast while singing and dancing, with the sole exception that Adrian Lester who proves to be a splendid singer and dancer. The only other saving grace of the film is the contribution of Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer as eye candy, but they gave better performances than those in this film and it would be wise to examine some of the other titles in their filmographies and give this without a mess passage.
