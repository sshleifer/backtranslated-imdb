The final song by Johnny Rivers was the only big thing about this movie. Unfortunately this is all the positive I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to publish, but there are more than 8 lines of terrible in this western. I'm not sure the film was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a parody. The hero and the villain in this film were too plastic. Not realistic at all. A lot of secondary actors in this film seemed authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought this film was exceptional, and in the comments he made an economic blow to President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad western movie to sell commercially. I wonder if he made any money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a film made by college students. If so, then it was a great movie.
