"54" is a film based on the infamous "Studio 54" of the 70s - the meeting place for the social elite and the clubbers of the party. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character, based on a true Studio employee from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem with the film is that it's all twinkle and style and no substance. Try to be a really dirty and inquisitive satire like "Boogie Nights" but in the end it looks like an inferior aspirant. Mike Myers is given the thankless task of playing Steve Rubell, the club owner who sniffed cocaine. It's just a somewhat comical role and if this was Myers's best attempt to get into the drama like Lemmon and other comedians in their time, it's a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" could have been perceptive and interesting but instead it is just another stupid teen movie that is not funny or even remotely engaging. View at your own risk.
