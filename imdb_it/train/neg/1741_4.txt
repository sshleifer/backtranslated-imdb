The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal combination was gold first with HERA PHERI and HUNGAMA, so I went to the cinema (in an Indian multiplex) with high hopes, especially after the slick promo. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL before this, this film was a huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> As others have commented, the premise of the film, which was already old to begin with, stretches without interruption. or additional layering. After a while, you just want the movie to finish like this so you can go home (if I saw it at home, it would have been a lot easier to reduce my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is at best average and John Abraham should not try comedy again. The comedic aspects of the film as a whole were a good week. I just remember giggling the whole movie twice. Certainly no laughter of broken belly that consumed me in HERA PHERI or even to a lesser extent in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. Paresh Rawal had some of his expected classic moments, but overall, since his role and character didn't have much room for growth, it didn't have much of an impact on this film. <br /> <br /> Neha Dhupia, who makes only one appearance in the film, was fun to watch while on the screen. And some of the songs are fun. Especially the opening and closing songs of ADA and KISS ME BABY, respectively. Otherwise, you better get through this movie.
