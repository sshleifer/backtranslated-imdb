This is the kind of film that leaves you with only one impression .. Writing a story It's what makes the film. <br /> <br /> Incredible visual effects .. Very good acting, especially from Shue. Everything is perfect .. Except .. The story is poor and so, everything fails. <br /> <br /> Imagine this, if you had the power to be invisible .. What would you do? Well, our mad scientist here (played by Kevin Bacon) couldn't think of anything but to caress and rape women. That's all his seemingly "brilliant" mind could think of. Do you try to gain extra power? No. He doesn't even bother to look for a way to be visible again. The boy is basically a crazy sex maniac. <br /> <br /> Add to that, the atmosphere of the lab, you have all these young boys .. Tossing pranks like they're in a bar .. If it wasn't for all the white coats and outfits, you'd think that this is a bad imitation of "Cheers". Very superficial and scarce personalities and very little care is put into making you think that these guys are anything but lambs for the Hollow Man wolf. <br /> <br /> Even as a thriller, the film is very short because most of the "Exciting" scenes are written so badly and are full of illogical behavior by the actors who are simply shouting "this is just a stupid thing that I have to do so that the Empty Man can find me alone and kill me." br /> <br /> If you read the actual book, while the Scientist (Dog) chases women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that enters his character. In the film, Dog is just the sick boy who goes to a crowded market to rub his body in women and get on board. Just sad.
