Rather the most boring nonsense I've seen in a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and acting was the worst I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles were used that made me feel bad, incidental music was terrible and drowned the dialogue (maybe it wasn't so bad), and the San Francisco shots seemed to be been stolen directly from the promotional video of the city's tourist board. <br /> <br /> Oh, and mandatory sex the scene wasn't even well done. Better lighting next time, please.
