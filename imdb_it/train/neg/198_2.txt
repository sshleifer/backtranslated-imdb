Burt Kennedy was a great director, but you would never know from this mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it's cheap - most of the battle scenes were raised by the distant "The Last Command" of 1955, and that movie, shot 32 years earlier, seems more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that have been shot for this film are disorganized, confusing and incompetent, with a poor appearance like the rest of the image. This looks like a bad student movie (and the budget doesn't seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, most of the acting is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose - even if Raul Julia comes off better than almost all the rest of the cast - and it's packed with annoying historical inaccuracies . Besides that, it's too long. If you're about to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and finish it - don't stretch it for more than three hours, like this. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, take a look at the 1960 version of John Wayne, or even the 1955 movie from which this film stole his action scenes. Hard to believe that it took six producers to make such a bad movie. Salta.
