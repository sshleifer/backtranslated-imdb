Oh my God. This was a real big mess that couldn't help alone. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29-year-old man who still lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and has no intention of going anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) with whom he could marry. <br /> <br /> It would have been an OK movie if Heder hadn't played his annoying Jeffrey, just starting there is no chance of pleasing him and getting worse and worse. In the end, he'd like us to like him, but there was no reason why he hadn't changed from being selfish that was at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton doesn't even seem to try and is in a horrible form after 2007 because I said so. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where is their mother and son supposed to believe? The only thing that saves is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, even if they don't seem very interested. Apart from a few small smiles, this film does not really deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is almost nothing to laugh about! If you're in the mood for a recent Diane Keaton, Mad Money or Smother movie, they're much better than this abysmal effort.
