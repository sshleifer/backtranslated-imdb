After the first 25 promising minutes that make you feel warm inside, you're pretty sure this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the film takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The feeling of warmth may still be there, but as others have said: the plot becomes so incredible and artificial that it is almost unbearable to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is speeded up and one has the impression that it is proceeding rapidly or that the producers have decided to mount it in less than 1 hour and 40 minutes and had to cut many scenes. <br /> <br /> Realism is not a goal in itself, but as a spectator, I am quite convinced that this play is not intentionally unrealistic, but simply it is. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, this film has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, I think the actors' performances are mostly good. If I could only evaluate the first 25 minutes, I'd probably give an eight. As it is now, get a four. ... And this is beautiful! <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of romantic comedies you will still have fun anyway. Otherwise, I would recommend you look at something else.
