I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> You can make a video game shootem up and turn it into a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this film you don't tie yourself to any of the characters because ... you don't have a chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is nice or even interesting is the deck hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Except for this unique character, the result of the film is meaningless since all the characters were lifeless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Error 2: the worst firefighting scene ever. I love the shootings. I love when the hero opens up to the bad and the clean house. heck, sometimes I even like looking at a badguy house. But this firefight was strange, I guess the best way to describe it is "Apathetic". I've seen people shoot with more feelings and emotions while PLAYING THE VIDEOGAM. In this film it seemed that the "actors" were simply walking through the footage of everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where's the trash that talks? where is the growl of rage among the shots? These should be children who have been discovered in a rave gone wrong ... but also real soldiers who act professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD horror movie about an isolated house full of monsters, I recommend the Sam Rami Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the home of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all the copies of this film.
