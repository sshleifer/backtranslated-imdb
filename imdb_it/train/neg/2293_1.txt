If this series were to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I, for example, think it failed terribly. The character is bad ... (Catwoman, for example, looks horrible ...) But what really bothered me is that it made Batman look like a kind of wimp that can't take care of itself in a battle, without the help of two, even three helpers. I mean, it's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comics, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be the allies of Batman, besides Robin, but anyway ... let Batman say he needs help from them ... What, can't he stand some punch? In BTAS, he could face a dozen opponents without any problem ... Is he getting old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And another thing: I really don't think Batman would have allowed a guy like Tim Drake to go into battle so soon, without years of hard training. One is irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, is not what happened in the comics, if we want to remain faithful to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The animated series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters ... That was really a legend of Batman. The New Adventures series has transformed the legend into another Batman movie.
