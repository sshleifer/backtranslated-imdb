Plot: When his wife, a journalist, is kidnapped and replaced by a double android, intelligence agent Eric Phillips tracks her down and finds a plan from an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. /> <br /> I didn't expect much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's hybrid sci-fi / action film "Cyber ​​Tracker". That film was nothing special, let alone a blatant rip-off of both "The Terminator" and "RoboCop". This sequel is the same as before, with an all-out action sequence that opens the film. There are lots of explosions, heavy gunshots and a huge body count, as well as some martial arts moves courtesy of the film's star, Don "The Dragon" Wilson. The whole film looks like a series of action scenes tied together with a minimal plot. On the acting front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant.
