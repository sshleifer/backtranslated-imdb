After seeing some of the great things about HBO - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say that I had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of "True Blood". Jeez. Often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old boy, some parts are simply horribly turned, (The scene in which she "saves" Bill, I mean, come forward. Throw a chain at the boy and do it around his neck and it chokes magically! This was rather embarrassing if you want my opinion, or a few moments before that scene, when it turns out that the couple went with Bill, ridiculous, he hears them planning their things, and like 5 seconds later, the magic! The 3 are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I mean that the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, intriguing, vampires coexisting with humans in our modern society ... but honestly I don't think they really wanted to do more than a little soap show, which the average teenage girl always looks at but that nobody else cares about ... Unfortunately, the script is poorly written, at best mediocre, it's superficial and extremely predictable, yes I thought it was some kind of joke or something. <br /> <br /> Actors offer very unconvincing performances, if you want my opinion. They seem to take the show very lightly, as if it were some kind of ordinary low budget family television program (well maybe that's what it is, if you take the family part away). The only actor that seemed a little good to me was Stephen Moyer in the role of Bill, considering the poorly written and extremely short answers he had to say "What are you ..." "I can call you sooner or later ..." I think that he did well to highlight the somewhat mysterious part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role must have, actually. Even Anna Paquin was fine, but no more. But the guy, playing his brother, however, is horrible. The scene in which he is arrested is simply a pity for modern television. The acting is bad, the yard looks fake and the other two guys "Why are you arrested? Uh ... I don't know ..." It was pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I think has completely escaped is the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They make us feel what people think and talk at the same time and this is simply wrong. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if the thought of people were some sort of annoying radio channel, and that when it comes close to them, it hits the right level of frequency and has to listen to everything it thinks. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are clearly superfluous and that sex scene with vampires is simply disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I wrote all these comments not because I thought the show was BAD, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality things. I didn't think it would be like this. It's definitely not a GOOD show. Mediocre at best.
