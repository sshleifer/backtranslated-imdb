Although there is a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often referred to as Jess Franco's best film. Heck, even the legendary director Fritz Lang counts "Succubus" among his favorites. So maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly boring and overly confusing film. The opening is great, however, and shows Janine Reynaud while acting in a film on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills his lovers in a sort of trance. Franco has a decent budget to work with and he spends it well in nice locations, beautiful photography and a hypnotic musical score. This may have been his biggest film in fact, had it not been for the lame and uninteresting story. It should be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better term to describe what is shown here. Half of the time, you have no idea what's going on or what exactly is being said, even if the short time of 80 minutes seems to last. This is definitely not the best Franco movie in my opinion. I wouldn't even recommend it to hard-working fans. If you are looking for a higher quality movie on Jess Franco, try getting your hands on "Las Vampiras", "The awful Dr. Orloff" or "Female Vampire".
