I really enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and I was amazed when I saw the trailer for this film, and even more when I found out that Bilal had directed it himself. The film, however, was a great disappointment. The images are not at all close to the rich and gritty texture of the original works of art and the story is told badly. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he doesn't do a great job either. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of the original novel was the friendship-hate relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstances. Above all, they were fun and funny. It is not so here. Nikopol has no discernible personality, and Horus is a pompous idiot who just wants to fuck. Even if the film is French, Horus doesn't have to be! <br /> <br /> We have seen all the movies we liked, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, for one reason or another. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone, except perhaps as a warning not to overdo your talent and your resources. Bilal is a master storyteller, but obviously he is not a master of any visual medium.
