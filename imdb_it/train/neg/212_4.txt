Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a rather boring show. Once again this photo is only focused on the "breakin" craze, but at least a little entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all grown up in Queens, New York. Everyone has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a DJ, another an artist who creates' burners', while his little brother 'Lee is a hot hip hop dancer. <br /> <br /> Lathan is not able to generate any real interest in the audience, however, and his young cast is also struggling with their characters. So it's almost entirely left to funky music and "fresh" dancing to save the day. <br /> <br /> The choreography is again acute for the club and street scenes, but alone it is not enough to raise "" Beat Street "to greater heights, unfortunately the film falls really late, after having shown a glimmer of hope that could be interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
