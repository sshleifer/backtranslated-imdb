First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you didn't know it already, then I think you're an idiot. But suppose none of us is idiots. We all know that animals have emotions and now we want to see how these emotions manifest themselves in nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we get instead is a boring and ridiculously simplistic documentary that tries to show how animals are "human". Filmmakers look for animal sequences involved in human behavior at the top and bottom, and when they do they say "That monkey is almost human!" (which is actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorising what makes dogs smile, but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even show chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and a cowboy hat. I was expecting an insightful documentary about animals on their terms. I wanted to learn how animals emulate in their own languages. But instead, researchers continue to resort to pedantic, anthropomorphic and hypothesis observations. Add a cheezy soundtrack and chimpanzee images "celebrate Christmas", and this was enough to turn the stomach. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't end there. Half of this documentary is shot not in nature but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the shots of the chimpanzees cross steel bars and we see how these monkeys are piled in their sterile concrete cages. A particularly shocking moment occurs at the beginning (although you must be quick to notice) where a captive monkey says in sign language, "You want to go out. Hurry up, go." <br /> <br /> Dark references are made to "stress tests" and psychological experiments that I shudder to imagine. The monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and wireframe dolls are given to show that the monkeys crave a "mother figure". And after 40 years of experiments, the smug researchers caress their backs to reach their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for this purpose and so far she remains. Let's take a brief look (again between the bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather dull expression. Personally, I don't need to see more experimental data. Washoe, I apologize for our whole species.
