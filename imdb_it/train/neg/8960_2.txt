the only thing that often comes to mind when I write this review is that I will never get an hour and a half again !!! to indicate that I am not just blowing air, I will compare the film with the other films in the cube trilogy (cube and hypercube)! cube was not exceptional but it was original and this compensated for some technical defects! as a sequel it lost the advantage of originality but it looked pretty sharp and I also liked beter che cube (the story was better)! but the zero cube compared to its predecessors is not really worth it, a complete lack of good fx, a very f * ck * d up script and simply an old bad acting don't combine well! example: all the time during the film I thought it would be incredibly stupid if it were to happen and then it would happen, so it's not even very original! my advice: don't lose that hour and a half I lost !!!!!!!! oh and i hope this movie gets stuck and burns !!!!!!!
