Murders occur in a city in the Texas desert. Who is responsible? Legends novelties of mystery and racial tensions (the latter is not really suitable), but otherwise strictly for slasher fans, who will appreciate blood and nudity, which are two conventional elements for these films. <br /> <br /> Dana Kimmell (of the infamy of FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3) plays the quasi-detective bratone. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on **** <br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for violence and blood, nudity and some tongue.
