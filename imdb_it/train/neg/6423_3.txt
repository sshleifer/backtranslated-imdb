The first 30 minutes of Tinseltown had my finger poised on the remote control, ready to turn around to look at something else. The premise of two writers, with their luck, living in a self-storage-space "bin" was slightly funny, but painfully insipid. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the character, played by Joe Pantoliano - the guy from the movie, who lives in the park and sleeps in a bathroom, offered hope and decided to give him a few more minutes. And then some others until Kristy Swansons' introduction as a budding director and borderline nymphomaniac added a little spice. His strong performance as a performer has raised his presence above and beyond just a very welcome welcome. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the obvious low-budget impact on the film with poorly shot scenes, pressing rhythms and slapstick manipulation of certain moments. Some of my favorite movies of all time have been low budget, Whithnail & I is one that also has to do with 2 guys with a dream but unlucky. <br /> <br /> However, for my money, the actors save Tinseltown from the archives of "Terrible movie" and almost pushes it towards "the archives of the cult film". I laughed out loud in some scenes of the character of Joe Pantoliano. In particular, the penultimate scenes in the house of the characters terribly clich√©, but still fun, rich but screwed up, in which the story unfolds towards its last moments. <br /> <br /> I can see how Tinseltown was great while filmmakers did their best to translate this into celluloid, it just didn't work and while I was laughing out loud in some scenes and in one, I think the first 30 minutes have dimmed my senses and my expectations a degree I would have laughed at anything. <br /> <br /> Unless you're stuck for a new coaster, don't pick it up if you see it in a bargain bucket.
