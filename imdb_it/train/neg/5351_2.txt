If you enjoyed the first two films, I'm sorry to say that you won't like this. This is the real video not necessarily necessary, but probably not necessarily made on TV. The still idiotic but kind scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately his wife wants to get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid that he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. Then his wife and his sister-in-law tighten too. Now adults have to find a way to raise their children. Practically a repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, eg a roller coaster for toy cars, swimming in the bathroom, etc. Quite poor!
