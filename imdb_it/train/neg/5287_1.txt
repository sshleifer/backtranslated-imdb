I have no idea why they made this version of "Persuasion" when they already had a nice miniseries with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I suppose they wanted to create a characteristic length version, but obviously it was necessary to cancel a lot; Alas, what ended up on the cutting room floor was all humor and humor, leaving a film that was just a melodrama rather than a funny display of English country manners and customs. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the characters were superficial and uninteresting. They had poor Anne going up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth as a stupid modern teenager (and if you happen to be a silly modern teenager reading this, let me tell you: run after a male like a female in heat is NOT nice). This is something that a well-prepared woman of the Napoleonic era would never have done, and certainly not this flat-headed heroine. <br /> <br /> Some said they found this antic ridiculous; my reaction was not laughter, but indignation. The very idea of ​​such a corruption of Austen's work is under contempt. <br /> <br /> It was horrible.
