Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you've tried so much. This is your magnum opus, a shining example to the rest of us who are certainly worthy of being nominated for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you declare on your 1998 website). Alas, it is better to remain silent and be considered crazy than to talk and remove any doubt. With Ben & Arthur, do just that. <br /> <br /> Apparently assembled with a lack of education or education, the film's script guides us towards the bizarre with each new scene. It is this insane excuse of a story that could also be the best ally in the film. Beginning warmly, the homosexual characters Ben and Arthur try to marry, going so far as to fly through the country to do so, in the shade of the most beautiful palm trees in Vermont. But all this attitude is only an advantage for BLOOD. So more blood and more and more blood. I mean, there must be at least $ 20 in fake blood make-up in the last third of this movie. <br /> <br /> The film in its entirety is a technical blunder. From sound to editing to music, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note held on a keyboard, it's surprising that the film is held together on whatever medium you see it. It's a shame therefore that some decent amateur performances are wasted here. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures on this rented movie or anything that makes poor souls (like me) see this movie. Unfortunately, we're not laughing with you.
