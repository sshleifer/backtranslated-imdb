Vodka Lemon is a fascinating but extremely irregular Armenian film that will delight some and bore others. Although it is reasonably well done, the film lacks a true "zing", relying instead on many scenes that will seem trivial for the astute observer of works of art. The film contains a handful of moments of pure cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and in light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many disoriented and eventually dissatisfied points of view. You could laugh, but these moments will be few and far between a sea of ​​faded snow-filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, eventually led by a lack of narrative cohesion.
