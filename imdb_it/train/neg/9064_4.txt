In fact, the off-Broadway adaptation of "Threepenny" by Marc Blitzstein was not as "bowdlerised" as is generally believed. <br /> <br /> (I have a special interest in "Threepenny", my father was part of the first full production in the United States, U of Illlinois Theater Guild did it towards the end of World War II. HJitler has been so successful in suppressing the game that they had to rebuild the script and get scores from recordings in two different languages ​​(neither English), German prompter script and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation - not a "translation" - who had the full approval of Lotte Lenya - he was much closer to the original than generally believed. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the version of what many people know is the recording of the cast of MGM (recently available on Polygram on CD) (which includes Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, the "complete big girl", and I can't see her hands on her hips and shoulders thrown back on that line - Bea was a great child in the 50s}, Paul Dooley and John Astin) was heavily censored by Mike Curb, head of MGM Records - I mean, 17 (I think it was) "Goddamn" was only cut for "damn". <br /> <br /> (At one time, MGM also offered a 2-LP set of the * whole * game, undoubtedly heavily censored.)
