This was really a bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend Lamberto sometimes comes up with a good one. I found the first two films of the "Demons" very amusing: they were so bad that they were great, but this is so serious that it is really very ugly. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife who slapped her husband and the whining wailing in his wife drove us crazy, there was not enough of the story dedicated to the Ogre that was probably best actor of the whole movie. I turned it off for about three quarters because I was very, very VERY! Do not worry
