What happens when you give a free man enough money to trap him in the race for success and see him writhing? The homeless do not respond to anyone. They have no mortgages, rents or idiotic masters. Homeless people don't have to worry about IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But just give them enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about getting into the race for success, buying gas for transport, paying for insurance on their car and working for someone else. They have the possibility of being "productive citizens". This film was almost as unrestrained as a movie can be. It is a way for the rich and bourgeois who says "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and claims capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie that asks, "What happens when you take away everything a rich man has?"
