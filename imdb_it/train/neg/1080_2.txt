As a director of the Altman experience you could never expect us to spend time with, or worry about, what happens, a main character who is neurotic, a whiner, an idiot with no redeeming qualities - this is the central riddle of this deeply confusing piece of work. A monstrous piece of garbage. In addition to this paralyzing defect, the plot requires serious concentration to follow. The setting that the character of Branagh runs into is therefore a configuration from the beginning that we are inclined to ask ourselves if the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience. This last question is at the center of the film: it represents the self-indulgence of the director with profound disregard for the taste, values ​​and intelligence of the viewer. Very unusual for Mr. Altman. <br /> <br /> Patrick Watson
