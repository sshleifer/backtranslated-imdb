I went to see this movie with low expectations, but I was hoping to be spellbound seeing my hometown in a movie. Unfortunately, that's all I got. The story covers a familiar territory (the high school meeting), but the plot is twisted and the supernatural element adds little to this well-worn theme. Although the quality of the acting was good overall, the film's content was scary. The film's sexism was brash - women are apparently dissatisfied unless they are married, procreated or both (although this has been expressed as a post-feminist choice). Worse still was racism - the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home - and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be ashamed if we think that these characters represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be shocked to have brought such vast and cruel stereotypes onto the screen.
