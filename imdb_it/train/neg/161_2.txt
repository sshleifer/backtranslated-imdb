If you can imagine Mickey Mouse as a street mogul in New York, or John Wayne as a communist spy, then you could believe Pat Boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's Kentucky farm and you could really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is so stupid that it is not even camped for a love story in the mid-fifties. And the problem is that Hollywood has made such a big deal about Pat Boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on the screen before her release, that the public knows she won't kiss Shirley Jones so that no prediction can be created for the "consummation of the screen" of their love It's a bit like watching a western where the cowboys don't have guns. <br /> <br /> The plot is useless. Even the title song is sung with suffered enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> April Love is part of the worst deal in the film with Ishtar and Plan 9 of Outer Space.
