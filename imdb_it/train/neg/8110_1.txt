I think Phillip Kaufman read the version of The Cliff's Notes from Kundera's novel and then decided to make this film. Ok, of course he won't have the original punch. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to get in and out of the stories he builds. This movie doesn't even try! Tereza's unique dream sequence, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes absolutely no sense. Also, and this is perhaps one point less, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywoodization of an otherwise excellent literature.
