I was willing to put up with a lot of late spring / summer fluff action movies, but in general it is due to the fact that many of them have a reasonable payoff (such as interesting special effects, interesting twists, comic value, Steve Buscemi, etc. .). This film, however, had none of this. All we got was the chill from Eva Longoria's slit (a Maxim number is cheaper than a movie ticket). There is an embarrassing lack of plot, suspense, background, character development, continuity, etc. I would like to go into details, but frankly I have already, perhaps intentionally, forgotten most of the film. <br /> <br /> As long as I was at the theater, I was kicking myself not just spending the afternoon watching a 24 season on DVD. Save your money on this, folks. Unless you really like Eva Longoria's neckline so much.
