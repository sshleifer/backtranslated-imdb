Although the plot was very detailed, and the plot was understandable, the fact that Steven Seagals' voice was dubbed with someone else's for most of the film was distressing because he wasn't sure who he was talking about. There were many parts where he would start talking in his deep, hoarse voice and then someone else's next voice was making the speech for him. I don't know though if he had difficulty with his voice during the production of the film, I think they could have shot at events that didn't contain his own voice when he had recovered. I rated this film 3 out of 10 based on the quality of the film. When you pay for a movie, regardless of whether it is at the theater or on DVD, this film is not worth the admission price that was charged. I have long been a follower of Steven Seagal and all his films he has made in recent years. Today I think this is one of the worst we have seen so far
