In this film, supporters of Chavez (both Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez's announcement that he fired many of PDVSA's best workers for political reasons only. <br /> <br /> They said nothing more than 96 TV interruptions broadcast by Chávez during just 3 days in "CADENA NACIONAL" (a sort of confiscation of private television signals). Each with about 20 minutes duration. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about the announcement to stop made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, Inspector General of the armed forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, despite his announcement, he is the Minister de Interior y Justicia. After Chavez's return he held the office of the Minister of Defensa (he is the same as the Secretary of Defense in the United States). They said nothing about Chávez's orders to shoot at a peaceful group claiming elections. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the people in this concentration who were killed by supporters of Chávez (both civil and military). <br /> <br /> They present some facts in the wrong order, so as not to lie. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Venezuelan civil society, which is now also claiming elections to resolve the crisis and Chávez's actions to avoid elections. <br /> <br /> That's why I tell you ... This movie is just a bunch of lies or a big lie.
