This is an interesting idea gone wrong. The meanings hidden in art left as clues by a serial killer seem intriguing, but the execution in "Anamorph" is excruciatingly slow and without much interest. There is no other way to describe the film if not boring. The signs of death are the only interesting part of "Anamorph". Everything that connects them is boring. Willem Dafoe gives a credible performance as an investigator, but has little to do with a script that is brought to the limit. Several leading actors are wasted, including Peter Stormare as an art expert, James Rebhorn as police chief, Paul Lazar as a coroner, and above all Deborah Harry, who is present on the back of the DVD case, but has only one couple pronounced through a cracked door. Not recommended. - MERK
