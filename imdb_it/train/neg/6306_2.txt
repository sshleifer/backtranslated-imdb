Working in a video store I can see a lot of movies and occasionally try to watch some of the not so great movies. He was proud to be one of them. The initial idea of ​​telling the story of a mostly black manned ship during the Second World War had some merit. However, in less than 10 minutes of viewing the film, it turns out that the main point of the film was to tell the racial tension in World War II. The background story concerns the ship, the crew and their businesses in the war. This main point is hammered on you to the point of excess in the whole movie. I commend the men who served on the USS Mason for their triumph in the face of adversity and adversity they have endured. A film should have been made focusing on the achievements that these men have made for themselves, the Navy and their country and not making a film whose focus is racism during World War II.
