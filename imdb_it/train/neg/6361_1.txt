Wow, this movie sucked great. I heard that this film expresses the meaning of friendship very well. And with all the clamor of the internet on this film, did I understand what could go wrong? However, the film was simply ugly. It was boring and the development of the character had never been there. Space Travelers was also a horrible movie, if you didn't like that movie there's no way you'll like it.
