First of all, a long time student of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs, I feel empowered to comment on the film. I really don't care how many prizes and awards the film has won, but for me it's still an absolutely horrible film. Cameron had the resources to make a "documentary" film suitable for disaster, but unfortunately he chose to turn it into a romantic, bare-faced mush. The fact that so many people all over the world fell in love only proves, in my opinion, the sad state of taste and common sense that critics and cinema audiences have these days. Who said that all films should have a hero and a heroine fall in love? In reality most of the real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly wasn't. I feel that he needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and with the minimum artistic license possible. I almost vomited in the last sequence in which the "dead" lovers meet among the other passengers and crew members who burst into applause. Is it a smart movie? Ask yourself.
