Why would a legitimate actor who would read the script participate in this piece of shit? My God, it's really embarrassing to even watch it. I can't imagine the shame these people have to feel to be a part of it. Also, there is apparently some controversy over whether River Phoenix had a cameo in the film. He was not credited but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister to those who have asked before. This film is proof that it doesn't matter how many big "names" you have. Sow's ears do not create silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but this was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone can explain to me one day the reason for this kind of film. It has no appealing, funny or even comical properties compared to anything that is bad.
