Wesley Snipes is James Dial, a hired assassin, CIA agent and pure special operating agent. During his spare time Dial wears a cowboy hat and raises horses with masculine names like Beauty. <br /> <br /> Join Agent Supervisor Collins. Enter a new job: kill a terrorist in custody in the UK. Obviously the UK is an ally state and is a great place for secret operations and head shots out of courtrooms. <br /> <br /> The assassination is a great success apart from the fact that the escape plan has exploded. So Dial's partner and local connection are killed in action as they try to escape the police, while Dial becomes a hot property with London cops trying to reach him and the CIA is trying to get rid of it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is usually visited by an adolescent Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who likes to go out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil body British police force ... <br /> <br /> With a script like that, should I add anything else? On the plus side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (whether he is a professional or a scammer) and the film is quite engaging. The least the assembly is very disjoint and has a wake effect on the stomach.
