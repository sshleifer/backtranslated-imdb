Now here is a film that if made in Australia would easily have been a comedy. Sadly and annoyed, here he is, flaccid and shoddy and overwhelmed by the land of Lala. How did the erector manage to make so much mistakes? Well, especially if you talk seriously about such a hilarious job that no one who is in their right mind could take seriously. Unless they were a solitary gay nerd cliche (but somehow nice) ... or it's that cliché piled up on the cliché. No value in history that seems almost a prequel to GERRY ..... by Gus Van Sant and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how is it all so important? Well, this author must have been so crazy that he couldn't convince Burt and BOOGIE to do it first. Convoluted and underdeveloped, apart from the theme "unrequited love is a bit boring", left over from a faded lyric by Streisand, we left only moody beefcake and serial TV series. The fourth unnecessary act of this turgid drama is truly terrible as the film moves away like the Gerries in the desert and remains stuck there. In Oz, at the end of the 90s, about 20 people produced a similar but actually funny film called MONEYSHOT. Originally shot as THE VENUS FACTORY, it also suffered from a more horrible author than Orson, so they reprogrammed half, got a ruthless TV publisher to chop it up and down for 72 minutes and hey-soon..comedy, tonight! A lesson there when bad movies become good by lighting up. I imagine that THE FLUFFER has stiffened on release and after seeing it not working, I can understand why.
