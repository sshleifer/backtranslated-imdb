I saw this movie on SXSW with the present director. Quite a few people left and the public barely managed to gather applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I saw at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> At 106 minutes, it's at least 95 minutes too long. You can see failed attempts and get out of the main character to communicate, in real time extended. The same grimaces, the hand-over, the cynical and frantically repeated words and the syllables over and over and over again. WE GET THE POINT. <br /> <br /> A site actually compares this work with the first Mike Leigh. What drugs should you be making this statement for? Since Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you should be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica in intense rotation to enjoy this movie. Incredibly, this won a jury prize at the festival. You can bet he didn't win an audience prize.
