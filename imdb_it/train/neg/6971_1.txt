All this disconcerting waste of film stocks needs Count Floyd who explodes every sixty seconds. Somehow they got Steve Railsback, Susan Anspach, John Vernon and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get to five miles, about eight kilometers, of a real movie. BOY does this thing sucks. There is no original line, thought, stroke or effect from a brainless opening sequence to a brainless closure. The magical and ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring. Steve Railsback - boring. John Vernon - boring. The big bug - boring. If this is a scary movie, Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary. <br /> <br /> Seriously - every bad movie contains his explanation of his wickedness. It is usually in the opening credits - "Written, directed and produced by" a boy. Or at the center of the action is a child so lacking in talent that you know there is only one reason why this turkey was created. Here, we do not discover the last of the credits, where the cooperation of about a dozen sub-functions of the Canadian government is grateful. <br /> <br /> Right now I'm watching the MST version on Beast of Yucca Flats to have the taste of getting out of my mouth. Ghod, what an improvement.
