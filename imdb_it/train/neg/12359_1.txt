I thought it was a really terrible movie - I found myself shouting on my TV a couple of times. One or both of the gay male conductors were mixed; between them there was absolutely no chemistry and Richard Ruccolo seemed to prefer to kiss a dog. The film covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting every break and trick, but not developing the intermediate reasons in every detail. These reasons would make some characters interesting, not the fight or the makeup scene in bed (lame even if you liked the movie). <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine like their characters, but it doesn't make the film worth renting. Save your money.
