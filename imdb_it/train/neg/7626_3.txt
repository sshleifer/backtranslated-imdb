After hearing the raves of this film for years, I finally decided to rent it and watch. I would like to start by saying that I am glad that the rental was free from the local library. This move was slow, boring, unrealistic and the plot made no sense. After 2 hours, I was ready to put that ruined city of Texas on fire and put the group of those characters out of their misery. I realize that taste is subjective, but believe me, I don't understand all the hype I've heard about this movie. Dallas has provided a good detail of life in Texas like this movie. Rent it only if you want to understand how film studios can pay enough money to reviewers to convince the general public that a bad movie is good.
