I have two positive things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk offers a good performance (considering the one he had to work with in terms of dialogue and direction). However, having said that, I found this film extremely tiring. Looking at the dry paint would have been more fun. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence, where everyone talks about each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything he is told on the phone, the film is annoying. The film is full of clich√©s and shtick, not to mention the endless episodes of Falk's audible flatulence. Furthermore, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to bet on laughter or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, but they are all played for laughter. If schmaltzy, sentimental and "cute" attract you, you will love it. But if you're hoping for something with more substance, watch another movie.
