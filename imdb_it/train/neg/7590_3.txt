Splendid bodies, magnificent colors and photographic work, pretentious dialogues, trivial plot. The name of the first woman, Camilla, and the frequently named homonymous flowers, are enough to remind us of the similarities of the plot from Dumas's novel La Dame aux Camelias, the film Camille with Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi La Traviata's work is important. Beautiful girls, not too virtuous, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, divided, gathered just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene ... One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialogues in the opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful interpretation of Los Angeles in the 1930s, an earthquake deus ex machina that conveniently kills the other woman and all that beauty in this mediocre turkey where there is not even a beautiful song?
