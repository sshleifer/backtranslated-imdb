I should have trusted my instinct better: no expectations - no disappointment. Instead, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally disappointed. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but an economic attempt to collect the cult success of his predecessor, and - artistically - fails miserably. It seems that some producers collected material left over from Koyaanisqatsi, threw it quickly, put it all in slow motion and got a little pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to quickly put together trivial background music, which is repeated incessantly. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with intelligent fast and slow-motion changes, Powaqqatsi is a long sequence of trivial images in slow motion (if you see them on your video recorder in quick preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What disappointed me most, however, was the soundtrack by Philip Glass. I could not - and still cannot - believe that these drone drones of a commercial sounding New Age type, which could easily be composed in an afternoon by a fourteen year old on a Casio computer, came from the same composer who so brilliantly composed emotional music and perfectly synchronized for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a big waste of time! My advice: forget mercantilism! Look at Koyaanisqatsi instead!
