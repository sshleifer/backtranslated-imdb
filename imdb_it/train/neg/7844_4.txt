No one goes on a movie like The Hills Have Eyes 2 and expects the second coming of Citizen Kane. The same applies to most low-cost horror films, particularly those that Roger Ebert has dubbed "Dead Teen Movies". The Hills Have Eyes 2 definitely qualifies as a Dead Teen movie, only here, kids have been given the superficial appearance of military trainees. <br /> <br /> Some will support the joke "it's just a movie" when questionable facts have been raised in a film review, but I've always been a staunch supporter of the fact that all good imagination must be rooted in reality to be effective. In Hills Have Eyes 2, we must believe that the main characters are military on a training exercise, but they look and talk like high school kids camping in the desert. The dialogue is terrible and often vulgar to excess. Although the films are not comparable, I kept imagining that these "soldiers" were in Platoons and trembling with terror. <br /> <br /> Very little of the characters evokes a soldier other than guns and suits: radio transmissions are played as telephone conversations as teenagers; a colonel is called "hey, asshole" by a private individual. And nobody seems to have the slightest idea what to do, or any sense of command structure, when things start to go wrong. I think of James Cameron's Aliens soldiers, a film of pure fantasy, and the way in which even those futuristic Marines behaved like real soldiers, despite their fantastic situations. Fantasy is rooted in reality. <br /> <br /> I try to start watching a movie like a 5 on a scale of 10, and judge its strengths and weaknesses from there. You must grant concessions for the material; there is no way that Star Wars is as good as a movie like The Godfather, on equal terms. But both are excellent examples of their type. <br /> <br /> In this respect, while Hills Have Eyes 2 is a rather terrifying exercise in amateur and immature writing, it is only modestly worse in this respect than the typical Dead Teen Film. From a technical point of view, the film seems to have decent production values ​​and is made quite well from that perspective. Scenes that are intended to shock or aim to evoke urgency or suspense generally work. So while watching The Hills Have Eyes 2 it could really be a fate worse than death, there are certainly far worse horror films out there. <br /> <br /> It's worth taking a look at those who love this kind of stuff without the usual fan baggage, or those who don't tend to think that every movie they see is the best ever or the worst of all times. If you don't "get" horror, especially the Dead Teenager variety, you won't have much fun with it. <br /> <br /> 4/10
