Silent, simplistic and brief, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: A WOMAN NOW) does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short (just over sixty minutes) short story is not so much inspired by the classic spaghetti westerns as it is a rip-off of THE RICK & THE DEAD by Sam Raimi (his homage to the spaghetti westerns) brought to a contemporary environment. In QUICK & DEAD, the character of Sharon Stone seeks revenge against the vile sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when he was just a brat, put his father's fate in his hands (a short cameo by Gary Sinise); she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the agile Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the vile Mr. Tojo (played with the minimalist call of Shingo Tsurumi), who, when he was just a brat, put his father's fate in his hands; he let his foot slip from the clutch, and dear old dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo distorts Saki sadistically with ?? Well, I don't want to ruin it for you if you decide to watch it. <br /> <br /> In short, Saki ?? a pale imitation of Clint Eastwood's "Man With No Name" ?? do you ride in the city ?? after all, there is a car shop and a tavern next to an American military base, so I guess it's enough for a city ?? corrupted by Tojo, the local crimelord with an incredibly high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing his true self as a bounty hunter, Saki employs local gunmen with shootings, whose choreography shows more than a resemblance to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, at the end of the film Saki suffered his right dose of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but did she get up for the occasion? on your knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending ?? and defeat all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Don't ask where the rocket launcher gets. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh. <br /> <br /> The image quality is average for the DVD version. There is a grainy quality in different sequences, but all in all, this is not a bad transfer. Sound quality sometimes leaves the imagination a bit, but again, it's not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> Rather, it's a bad movie.
