This is the second film I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers was the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only assume that I have observed that the production must have been rather limited. I have to admit that the story started interesting but it really ruined me. We were not given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters that made their irregular characteristics even more annoying. I must say that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as a sheriff. The only reason I sat throughout the film was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to be not so interesting. Some other background on the family would have helped, but at first they didn't look like a family at all. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I couldn't even watch it on DVD. The score of four is for the initial potential that the story could have had. This was one of jumping for horrorfest.
