Gadar is a really stupid film because it tells a false story. It's too unrealistic and it's a typical solo movie that aims to hit Pakistan. The film's goal is to mislead viewers so that they can think that Pakistan and its government are bad but trying to hide their flaws will not work. And all the songs and music in the movie are all bad. Most likely the Sikhs will love the movie because they have been misled. The film sucks and sucks strongly. I think only Amisha Patel was good at the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, but the lowest is 1. Please, save 3 hours of your life and don't watch this stupid boring movie.
