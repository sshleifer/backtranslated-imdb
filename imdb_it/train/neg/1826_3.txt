I saw this movie last night and even after a couple of beers the only giggle that this movie made me was when I realized I was really looking at it. in a word, it's not funny. Unfunny. I am absolutely convinced that the curiosity about Jack Black apologizes for making this garbage. I can't believe Barry Levinson just didn't launch this script when he read the first page. besides, I can't believe I saw him more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave it to 3 out of 10 * because I love to see christopher walken make terrible salary films. furthermore, the "corky" horse, simply existing as a character in this film, is actually quite ridiculous.
