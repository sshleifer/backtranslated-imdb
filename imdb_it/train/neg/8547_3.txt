This was a pretty scary movie; I found the music to be effective for this. Even the photographs taken by Mario about the village were disturbing. However, I had three problems with this film. One is that the lighting was very dark, so for a while it was hard to say what was going on, but this may have been just my copy. The second is that the beginning is not explained very well and I'm still not sure what was going on. The third problem is that I didn't understand the ending, but apparently some people do it. Of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male protagonist is very 70s. All in all, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.
