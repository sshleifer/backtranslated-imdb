Being of Puerto Rican origin, I had mixed fills on this "documentary". First, I was offended by the fact that Mrs. Perez compared Senator Campos to Che Guevarra. Even just a fact, Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent. His parents came from Columbia. Who did research on this was not very precise. I feel that the future of our race is based on education. This message should have resonated throughout this film, education is our path to freedom and power. I think that any future effort of this production group should make this their focus. In my opinion, this film has fluctuated towards an anti-American sentiment.
