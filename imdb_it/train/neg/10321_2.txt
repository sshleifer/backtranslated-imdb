This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and are only getting worse. I am one of those people who has never been a big Corner Gas fan, but at least I liked it at the beginning, until it took hold during the second season, all the lines had been played and the characters had nothing for their. Well, at least at the beginning the Corner Gas was good, Little Mosque on the Prairie is generally a bland CBC comedy that had nothing to do with episode 1. Who are the people watching the show anyway, me am I honest, are they old people or maybe just people who actually live in the grasslands? Maybe the jokes are for them and work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it alone, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than Corner Gas. I hope it doesn't last much longer because all the success that this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise that this show is Muslim, that it is different and could / should have led to a great show.
