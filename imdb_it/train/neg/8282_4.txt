By now you should already know about this movie, the "bomb" of Jessica Simpson who practically went directly to the video (limited and anemic theatrical race). Basically, Ms. Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She is stuck, but she has a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I would like to see more often in the film), who leaves her alone. Katie ends up getting a job with two conniving colleagues (Penelope Ann Miller and the always funny Andy Dick) who are using Katie to get the company president (Larry Miller) out. This is strictly a b movie, not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress in any way, but she is very beautiful and never really annoying. The film is watchable as it is not an abomination, but its disposable fluff. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is fun (a subtle joke about Milwaukee made me laugh), and there's a fun scene involving Norwegian priests (don't read too much into this). So it's not horrible, but easy to jump. Your sure bet is to watch it on television, if it ever does. Again, not good, but not a profound disaster.
