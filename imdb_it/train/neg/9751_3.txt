The only reason I didn't give this movie for less than 3 stars is because it's not quite on par with a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. The biggest crime of this film is the fact that it is incredibly boring and terribly, unforgivably English. The premise of this film seems potentially promising, the whole concept of teleportation, but the direction they followed was completely uninteresting. It was more like a film about research funding and bow ties than about laser projection. The actors were wooden, without emotion and detached. As was the love story between the two scientists, which was far from intriguing. I was never able to say what the attraction between them was because the chemistry was non-existent. Nor did I really understand why the boy with the melodious features decided to slaughter everyone he met. At least now I know that I should always give someone an impartial hearing before they stop their research grants, otherwise they go on a rampage, killing wildly with idiotic gestures.
