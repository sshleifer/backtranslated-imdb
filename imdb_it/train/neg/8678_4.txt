After seeing "The Bodyguard" last night, I felt compelled to write a review of this. <br /> <br /> This could have been a pretty decent film if it wasn't for the horrible photographic work. It was beyond annoying. The corners were all wrong, it was impossible to see anything, especially during the combat sequences. Close-ups were also horrible. <br /> <br /> The story has Sonny Chiba hiring as a bodyguard for anyone willing to take him to the top of a drug ring. He is approached by Judy Lee, who is never completely in line with Chiba. Lee's involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought, while the Mob and another gang of thugs follow her. <br /> <br /> The story was decent and, despite the horrible dribbling, this may have been a good movie. With better direction and editing, I'm sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie. As it stands, it is more like another 70s action movie. <br /> <br /> Note: the opening sequence has a quote familiar to "Pulp Fiction" fans, and then continues with a Times Square karate school that is in no way related to the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 out of 10
