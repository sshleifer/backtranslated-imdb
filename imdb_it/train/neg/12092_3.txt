I do not fail to recognize the film production capacities above the average of Haneke. For example, I appreciate his persistence in insignificant contexts illuminated by natural light as a powerful means of forcing a strong sense of realism. However, as regards the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still a desire to pathologize relationships or feelings of submission-domain (and / or BDSM practices). The problem the main character has with his mother is incredibly current, as is Walter's alienation and misunderstanding (I do not mean the frustration of a lover who is not loved in the same way, which is understandable; he looks at it as if were she crazy, or like a monk, let's go!). I mean that D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something "bizarre" or pathological; it is not. In general, the films that deal with this topic are really behind the times. <br /> <br /> So for me, I feel that this film ends up being a rather programmatic film, worried about very obsolete psychoanalytic theories (isn't it almost embarrassing?), and this doesn't really relate to lives and the real life experiences of those engaged in D / s relationships (personal experience, forum, irc chat rooms, even recent scholarly studies will show this).
