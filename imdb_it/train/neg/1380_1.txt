This was the worst movie I saw at the WorldFest and even received the slightest applause afterwards! I can only think that he is receiving this recognition based on the number of known actors in the film. It's nice to see J.Beals but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the one allowed. The rest of the acting is difficult to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The main character is totally unpleasant and therefore boring to watch. There is no real emotional depth in the story. A film that revolves around an actor who can't work doesn't seem very original. Nor the development of the policeman. It looks like one of the many straight-to-video movies I saw in the 90s ... And not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
