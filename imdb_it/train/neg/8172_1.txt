A cannibal killer is lurking and two pairs of litigants could be his next source of protein in this deal. Friday the 13-year-old clone. There is literally nothing interesting to see in this, the killings are surprisingly sparse and when they happen, completely amateurish. It also adds ghosts in the mix without reason, why ever. I felt drained after seeing it as if my brain was thinning and draining my nose. And it remains without doubt the worst film by Donald Jones. If you are thinking of renting it due to the new edition of the Code Red DVD, don't worry <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
