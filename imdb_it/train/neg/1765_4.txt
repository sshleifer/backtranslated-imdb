OK: the helicopter shots are fantastic and the director made good use of some of the best views in Barcelona. Otherwise ... the production value jumped in the first few minutes and the rest of the film looked like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk was the deepest and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... well, William Baldwin. He was able to put his martial arts training to good use and to be a real action character. The rest of the cast was wood at most, but mostly paper. So, if you're nostalgic for Spain, it's a postcard with a touch of action and a good dose of El Greco. Otherwise, jump.
