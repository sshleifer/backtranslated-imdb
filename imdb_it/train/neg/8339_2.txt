This film runs in circles and the viewer does not know where it is. At first I thought ... mmmmm, it could be a cool movie, but it drags on and on, and in the end you don't know what's going on. The protagonist is a good actress and has played her role well, and the psychologist is disturbing, but after a while you don't care what happens, because this movie drags on. Too bad, this could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I would say however that the female protagonist and the psychologist will have a good career ahead of them, but they will remember this film, for having made them known, or for being the film that they regretted having ever done.
