I saw this movie numerous times in the late 60s / early 70s whenever it grew like a reindeer angrily every November-December like a Saturday matinee kiddie show. The competition for THE CHRSTMAS WAS ALWAYS HARD, THAT ALMOST WAS NOT (I ought to say "Christmas"?), Perhaps the greatest, the most iconic Christmas film of all time. But this is another review. <br /> <br /> At the time, I was surprised that the shade on the screen of SANTA CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so much the color of the prints torn from the pinion changed color. <br /> <br /> The film is rather disturbing! I thought it then - and I still do it, actually. I was very amused then, as I still am! It's funny in a "reteded-elf" way. By the way, the quality of the images looks much better on the DVD I have now than it was in the theater, around 1969-74. <br /> <br /> If you are perhaps expecting "the RANKIN-BASS Christmas special lost- forget it! If you want FELLINI FA Christmas - read on ... <br /> <br /> By nature, the dubbing of these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish) always makes them seem "surreal." This adds intrinsic quirks to the film and is also quite scary in that a "mischievous demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the whole movie trying to turn decent kids into "bad guys". talkative "guy who wants to have parents for Christmas - suddenly the" port-a-family "emerges from gigantic" Christmas gifts "until he realizes he's dreaming of eyes open! See this, Christmas lovers - and if you're a bully, save your stash - this movie will make you think you're a hallucination ... without drugs!
