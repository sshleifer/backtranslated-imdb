The full title of this film is "Waqt: Race Against Time". This is a race that no one will ever win, but you can certainly reduce your profit margin by not wasting any of your precious "waqt" on this bakvaas. This film was awkward and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. He put my credibility to the test. He was ridiculously stupid in his plot, and deserves to be teased about it. <br /> <br /> It's not as horrible as Baghban or Nero, but this film has nothing to recommend. Stupid, useless, with a ridiculously OTT performance by Amitji. The central "plot" is another bad example of the crude manipulative propaganda that infests so many "family" films in BW. If my father, who raised me and I love him a lot, treated me as if Big B had done Akshay, I would have shot him myself. Not to mention the trivialization of terminal illness.
