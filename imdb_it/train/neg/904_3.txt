"Stella", played by Bette Midler in the title role, is an unperturbed tear-jerk. Set in New York State, Stella Claire works as a bar waitress, pouring and dancing in a worker's saloon. One night, Stephen Dallas, a medical intern, makes love with Stella, and in the course of their relationship he impregnates her. He rejects both his offers of marriage and abortion, sends him into a lucrative medical career and lifts his daughter into almost poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and her daughter grew up in a beautiful, loving, young woman. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, he still maintains a tenuous but loving relationship with his daughter and ... I'm wandering, and worse, making the movie a little interesting. The acting and the script are so exaggerated as to make you moan almost in every scene. The main crime is Bette Midler, but John Goodman is his alcoholic companion. Each scene seems more elaborate than the previous one until the end, which is really fun. Considered a dramatic piece, this film does not exceed grade D, but as a field, it marks an unintended B +. <br /> <br />
