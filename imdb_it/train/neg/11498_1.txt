Gadar is an example of one of the worst overrated Bollywood films of all time. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers making films related to the period gives a junk movie. The songs were boring and it's not the kind of song you want to hear in your car, at full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making silly movies, where he beats 100 bad guys. He kicks a metal prison door (Indian) and kicks away a moving car (Teesri Aankh). I can give 50 more examples of Sunny Deol's shameful deeds. But I'm sure many people already know that. Sunny gives a pathetic performance by repeating the same kind of role once again. A guy who claims to be fighting for his piece of country, using violence. Amisha Patel is without sexy hands and with a fantastic body that I would like very much. But even she could not save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes as he usually does, he doesn't do that in this movie. Maybe because he played a Muslim, but he doesn't behave like one in the movie. Overall, it's a poor show, I'm sure someone will like it, who loves to see the Bollywood actor beat 100 guys. Give me a break.
