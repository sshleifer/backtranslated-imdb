One Stinko of a film that presents a store story and, to be gentle, a recitation of less than an Oscar caliber. But for me the only worst flaw was the total false representation of a jet plane, and in particular a 747. Some of the main mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. No flight engineer (or even one flight engineer station) 2. Incorrect identification of the F-16 interceptors as F-15 (no reconfiguration whatsoever) 3. Passenger load in a "luggage compartment" presumably accessible from the cabin - Even if such a compartment existed, placing so much weight that poop would have made the aircraft unworkable 4. Hollow point bullets that "won't damage the plane" 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to throw up. SR-71 (of all planes) with a pressure-sealing tailgate 7. Open a cabin door to the outside - in the wind - in flight !! <br /> <br /> Ah nuts, it was just a really bad movie. the list of the 10 at the bottom of the year.
