Lipstick is another failure of the glossy film. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie, and I'm having trouble finding something. I imagine the red dress that Margaux Hemingway wore at the end of the film was the best part. The script and script were not the worst I've ever met, but it could have been much better. The lipstick was very pleasant to see. The sets were very shiny and pleasant to look at. The cast was okay. I felt that the character of Anne Bancroft was the only possible character in the whole film. He was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this.
