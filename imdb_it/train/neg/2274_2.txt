Well, I hate Hollywood, but I love cinema, so I have to watch these cruel movies in theaters. And I was hoping that Vanilla Sky would be good. I was hoping that they would keep the original "Open your eyes" exactly the same, or that they would do it themselves. Well, a little bit of both happened, and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more. But in the end we listen to The Beach Boys Good Vibrations. Talk about a wide range of suck in between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple of others, but why oh, why did they have to spend GV during the climax. He was more annoying than confused or brash. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = primary. Everything. <br /> <br /> He also had a nice encounter with the club scene. This was nice. Otherwise the film was a big ball of arrogance. As if the public could get the movie. Those who would like to read the subtitles, and the rest do not. It's that simple. The reasons have all been ruined. I didn't understand the Diaz motives (hadn't they made the chicken soup the night before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard Tom Cruise cannot act (especially in this type of film [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I see. In any case, they tried to improve the original with a disgusting American soundtrack and shitty corners, a good cinematographic print and a lucid elaboration and would have helped if the crowe hadn't ruined it. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Big disappointment.
