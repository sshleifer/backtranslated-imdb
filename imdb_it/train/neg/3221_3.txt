I saw it on the pipe last night. The actor involved was the first to capture my attention. The first scenes were to throw attention. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I heard that the last third of the film diverged. If it wasn't for the first part of the film, I would have stopped watching. I kept looking at wanting to see how it's tied together. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. In particular, I did not like the extended period in which many of the characters spoke in Yiddish (?). Was it the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would you recommend it? No, I think not. As other reviewers mention a lot about the jargon it is dated (60's jive) but it wasn't too annoying. The ending completely upset me.
