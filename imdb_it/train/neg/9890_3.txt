Another rape of History <br /> <br /> This film is a catastrophe; he uses only a historical story and makes a sweet love story, with bad acting and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The film should be 1/3 of the time, they just dragged the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the solids are confused, the costumes are a catastrophe. The Romans were good at fighting in open areas, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest, in this film the Romans choose to fight alongside the city, I mean to become real. <Br /> <br /> And by the way Cleopatra came from a Macedonian origin, which means a light-skinned person.
