2 stars for Kay Francis - it's wonderful! And she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that Warner Bros. had thrown at her! <br /> <br /> The dual premise on which this film is based is ridiculous and incredible to the extreme. Kay is a wife and a provincial mother who wants something bigger: she wants to be an actress. When a big-shot actor arrives in the city and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, Kay tells her husband that she's going to the cinema. The biddy of a hubby's mother puts a bug in the hubby's ear that Kay is not sincere and goes in search of her. He finds her with the actor in the hotel (they're just talking!) And he hits the boy, who falls on a balustrade, lands face to face in a pond (lake?), And dies. Now here are the two incredible premises on which the rest of the film is based: <br /> <br /> 1) the judge tells the jury that if it is determined that the man died * before * his head went into the water , who must find the husband guilty of first-degree murder. (Whaaaaa ?????? I think hitting a boy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not a murder of FIRST DEGREE. Give me a break! But the plot forced him to be found guilty of murder 1 so that he can be sent to prison for life.) 2) the husband's lawyer, after being sentenced and sentenced, tells Kay that it's all his fault. His reasoning is that if she didn't go to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have to follow her and hunt down the boy and kill him. He tells her that she is the culprit, not her husband, and nods and accepts. What. Il. Inferno?!?!?! The rest of the film is about Kay trying to get fame and money to get her husband out of jail and correct the wrong he did by making him kill the actor guy in the first place. <br /> <br /> I can't even get on with this review. The film was too painful. Four years earlier, in the days before the code, you would never have captured Kay while playing with this guy! In the true fashion of Kay Francis, however, he did his best to make us believe that this woman was a credible character. I give you a lot of credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility in this thankless role. This character was very different from Kay's pre-code roles and the real life spitfire Kay Francis. <br /> <br /> Maneuver clear of this! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! (From personal experience, I can warmly recommend Mary Stevens, MD and Jewel Robbery, even doctors Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure there are also other fantastic Kays, but I'm just quoting the ones I've seen and can recommend.)
