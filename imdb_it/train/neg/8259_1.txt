I saw this movie a long time ago when it was premiered. <br /> <br /> It was based on the idea that autistic children could communicate with typed messages with someone else simply by helping them and guiding their hands. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly these children, many of whom weren't even looking at the keyboard or screen when the messages were being typed (they could look at the ceiling in some cases), but their moderators were the keyboard glued eyes, he began typing messages of abuse from parents and other people, sending parents and agencies for assistance to minors in Proberbico drainage, right and left. <br /> <br /> The whole thing proved to be a mistake when a third person presented a file, opened it to the child and said 'type in the image you see', then while the presenter has transformed the folder in the moderator, a fold would have lowered, revealing another different image. <br /> <br /> So while the child may have seen a dog, the moderator saw something like a boat. <br /> <br /> Each time, every bloody time, the name of the photo typed was what the moderator had observed, never what the child had shown. <br /> <br /> So who was he writing? Never the child. <br /> <br /> This film took a disastrous turn, as the Australian manifesto stated, the person who molested the child in the film was in the situation trying to help the child. <br /> <br /> If Melissa Gilbert had never put her son in that place, she wouldn't have been harassed, that's what the movie says. He was better under his supervision. <br /> <br /> If I turn my child into your organization for help and he gets harassed, you think I will be eager to listen to everything you need to say later? Not likely! I think it's a safe bet that all these accusatory messages that these guys were typing, that this movie was based on, have never accused anyone of their operations as happened here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I remember that the film gave Gilbert a great performance as an autistic mother, but apart from that, the film didn't do much. <br /> <br /> The worst was by far the child who wrote the end of Patty Duke, and we hear the mechanical voice reread what he wrote ,. . . . . "we won!" This child has been harassed. If you cut my leg and take me to court and you are found guilty of damaging me, of attacking, whatever, then that's legal justice, but it doesn't bring my leg back. <br /> <br /> At best, in my conditions, I will see it as an empty victory. <br /> <br /> Whatever the possibility that this child has had in what is perceived as normal with autism, it is further damaged by harassment. <br /> <br /> A "normal" child has enough to contend for such an experience. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely superficial to think of having to consider every situation and go "we won" if that person is found guilty in court. <br /> <br /> Only bad management of a situation and circumstances all around.
