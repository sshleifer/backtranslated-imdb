It is not unusual to see US films re-emerge from foreign films that fall on their faces, but here is the downside !!! This is a horrible re-make of the British movie "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but fun and entertaining! "Liam" on the other hand is just weird. I have to give "Liam" credit for one thing, and this is to make it clear that I made the right choice in changing my religion!
