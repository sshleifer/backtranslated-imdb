Yes, unfortunately I came across the DVD and found that it was incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some idiot in an orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea that these guys can come up with for a character, then they should definitely not be in the movie scene. Poor "costumes", bad "interviews", and basically there is no "fighter" on this entire record with any shred of charisma. <br /> <br /> The "wrestling" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is none other than these idiots softly and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. They enjoy laughing together all the time, making the experience more like a child's than a wrestling deathmatch. <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a decent Backyard Wrestling clone. Only instead of blood, weapons, chaos and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, giggling children, TERRIBLE audio and a guy called Orange Sherbert. <br /> <br /> Fans of wrestling or not, avoid this DVD. It's horrible.
