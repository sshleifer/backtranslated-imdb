ATTENTION: I recommend to all those who have not yet seen the film not to read this comment. <br /> <br /> Although I have never seen them all, the Hamiltons have certainly provided a small entertainment show, which does not entertain me at all !!!! I thought that in common with the semi-bad acting, the stupid plot scheme and the late-film twist at the end of the movie, this movie sucked !!! Ok, so supposing these are people who eat other people. Yes ...... warning I said that people are not human, not because they are not human, or they are waiting for me to think they are, OH NO WAIT, THEY HAVE NOT SAID! ! So, okay, these people are cannibals, or they're imbred, or what they are THEY !!!! I mean, maybe it's just "things" that came here to see what the people like or are, cannibals who have been eating people for a long time, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE !! WHICH WAS !!! So if you think The Hamiltons is good, I ask you, why, why, WHY, WHY, why was it so great, why for me it was just terrible !!! A great BOOOOOOO for The Hamiltons !!! Go see The Gravedancers, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of fun !!!!!
