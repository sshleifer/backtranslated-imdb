I'm usually disappointed with network movies. Even the flixes that attract big name actors are usually ruined by TV people. However, this is the worst of the worst. The script is weak and the acting, in particular that of Tracey Pollan, is abominable. I went to see my children's school plays and I was treated to better acting. Pollan behaves as if he were reading the script while talking. When trying to express fear, anger or pain, it is extremely empty. Because of the general quality of the production, I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to challenge this, prepare yourself for a great disappointment. Scary things will not scare you, sad things will not make you sad, romance will not make you feel warm and confused and you will probably be anxious as I saw the end coming. "First to die" says a lot about this film.
