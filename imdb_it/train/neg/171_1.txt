I thought that Hedy Burress (who managed to escape from the watery tomb of the first part) would have been in the second part. I just think they should kill her like on Friday 13th Part 2 (you know what I mean). <br /> <br /> These films like Scream 3 and Urban Legend 2 have followed the films of a movie. <Br /> <br /> This was PURE CRAP! The whole movie in a movie shit. <br /> <br /> BAD STAY AWAY!
