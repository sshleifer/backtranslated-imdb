I rented this movie on DVD. I knew the film wouldn't live up to what it promised me at the back of the case, but once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was there, I had to rent it. It starts quite well, with the premise that tobacco films are broadcast by cable. However, the main character has nothing on her to make you feel sorry for her, and the end of the film leaves you really pending. There are too many unanswered questions. In the end there was a fantastic scene that totally surprised me, but overall this is a very sub-par movie, but I suppose it's worth paying $ 3.99.
