There is absolutely no plot in this film ... no character development ... no climax ... nothing. But it has some good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good. So here you go ... a movie on the whole is pretty ugly, but if you like a mindless movie that offers nothing but a good action scene, watch this movie. Don't expect anything but acting. A decent acting and a not so bad direction .. A couple of Kimbo and Carano cameos ... I wanted to see Carano a little more in this movie ... he's a good fighter and a really sexy girl ... White he is a great martial artist and a decent actor. I really hope he can set a better film in the future, so we can enjoy his art ... Imagine a movie with White and Jaa together ... it would be great
