My father is a Columbo fan and I never liked the show. I always declare my contempt for the show and tell him how serious it is. But keep looking at it anyway. That is his right as an American, I think. But my senses were tuned to the series when I found out that Spielberg had directed the main episode. It was then that I was grateful that my father had bought this show that I really can't stand. I looked at his DVD collection and inserted this when I returned home for a college visit. My opinion of the series as a whole was not influenced, but I gained respect for Spielberg knowing he started like most low-level directors. And this is a little dribble until the big fish arrives (take the pun, HA, HA. Like Spielberg did. He's like Jesus before he became a man. Or at least that's what I think he would be. Columbo fan of how much you will probably like, even if it contains little of Peter Falk I attribute this to the fact that this is the beginning of the series and nobody knew yet where to go with this episode guilty of the crime instead of the investigation of Columbo, like many episodes later.
