terrible, just awful! my old roommate used to look at this stuff and drive me crazy. the book is one of my favorites and it's a shame that some people will never know what it really is because their first impressions come from dribbles like this. they have changed so much that it is hardly recognizable. which baffles me since the book still reads like a soap opera, providing enough fodder for modern entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a true story" but are completely invented. there is no emotion or depth of the book, only an unreasonable melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, I suggest you try another version.
