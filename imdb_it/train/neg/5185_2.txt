A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and the dialogues are poorly written, the direction is poor and the acting borders on the hammy. This film was clearly aimed at the Rang De Basanti audience, but it is very far from the brand because it does not even have one of the elements that made RDB si connects with its audience_great script, terrifying acting, good direction and a powerful social message that has never been preached but shown. <br /> <br /> Compared to this quasi-masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by using scenes such as while the hero is taking a leak on the Persian rug of the villain and the hero's mentor staring at the bullets in a truck not less! All this could have been acceptable in the 1980s, when there was a decline in the quality of the films and bad films like Divya Shakti and Phool Aur Kaante became great successes, but the cinema became - it should become bigger and more considerate of late. <br /> <Br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a capable director and I appreciate that he wants to give a social message in every film he makes but maybe he just doesn't know how to do it! He uses sermonizing without worrying about the public's intelligence in understanding what he is trying to say. Perhaps he should focus only on entertainment and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khan. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with everything I say, you will agree that during the screening you will be Thinking that Rang De Basanti was much better and Mr. Santoshi would have to leave the industry grappling with Om Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? That's right !! Santoshi depicted the industry as a place to bite, bitching and throw the couch that the hero happily leaves behind with a star curiously called Sania. There are some people who will think these parts show the true face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> All in all, raise your voice against movies like this and don't spend your hard-earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * out of ****.
