This is probably the most boring, worst and useless film I've seen last year. The plot that had to have some philosophical aspects emerged as an empty copy of the matrix, with many clich√©s: the lonely, handsome, psychologically disturbed policeman who sleeps with his gun ... + handsome and shy worker, but beautiful scientist , add a 2 cent storyline and you have me, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx, Audi, converse etc. This film smells like marketing and tends to be more of a poor advertising spot that unfortunately won't end after 30 seconds. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy, if you have some free time, instead watch a good TV program or read a good book better.
