I'm watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel the TV was running on when I turned it on. It is a story that is not very credible and quite boring about the wife of a pastor (Alexandra Paul) who falls into lust with a young stallion / tramp (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey takes off his shirt a lot and Alexandra faints. I have the feeling that it shouldn't have anything good, and that's why he jokes with the skinny Alexandra Paul. It is not very important because, as I said, you take off your shirt a lot and I just caught a glimpse of the décolleté. There is a lot of sax in the soundtrack, which is just painful.
