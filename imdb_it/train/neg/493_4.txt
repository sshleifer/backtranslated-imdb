The dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and the murder and the result of the chaos. Violent and sexy Milligan in her most made home. Little better than a home movie (like many of Milligan's films), this is a journey into the depravity style of the 1960s. Remarkable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor creepy, now playing more bizarre (though decidedly valued). The film suffers from its unequal cast and the cheapness of production (no one was ever sure where his films had gone since he was always broke). It's a bad bad movie that isn't worth seeing except as a Milligan suit or because it has some good-looking people joking.
