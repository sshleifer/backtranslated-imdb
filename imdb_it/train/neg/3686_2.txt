I'm surprised everyone (even the critics) seem to think this was a good movie. It was the most clich√© thriller I have ever seen. We have the "bad guy" who wants to force the "good guy" (or the girls in this case) to do something or face the consequences. The "good girl" in this film must use her skills and abilities to defeat the "bad guy" and save the day and her loved ones. Using charisma, courage and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well, a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets a young man named Jackson Rippner (nice name) at an airport. A coincidence leads to another and soon it seems that destiny brings these two together. Sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seems to get along anyway ... Is there more to this strangeness? Could these two be designed for each other? Does "destiny" have a reason for their strange and casual encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, apparently, unfortunately yes. Jackson needs Lisa to help him assassinate the Director of Homeland Security by moving him from room to room so his men can launch an attack. Oh, if she doesn't, her father is dead. Even if we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, Jackson then explains how this will happen and why it is in Lisa's interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Naturally, Lisa defeats her evil plans with her intelligence and in the process they stab him in the neck, make him stumble on chairs, and hit him with a field hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she leads him on a wild hunt through Miami airport where she is passed after 9/11 and steals a car she later uses to hit the man who was ordered to kill her father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson, who can get his hands on high-tech weapons, needs the help of a hotelier. Couldn't he just stick a bomb in the building? Wouldn't it make it safer for him and his team by leaving third parties out? And why do people like Jackson also explain everything they're about to do to someone they are threatening? Doesn't this make it easier to stop them from the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best considering the film they received. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to watch out for. Also, I think Jayma Mays (who played the lovely Cynthia) will be someone we'll see more of. It's just a pity they were all stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
