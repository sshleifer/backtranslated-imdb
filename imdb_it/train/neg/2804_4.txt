I was probably spoiled by having first seen the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I didn't get any chemistry among the 2 main stars. A lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and what it meant to put Tim in the role of Rochester. The casting director had really never read the book. Very strange! He's a good actor, but Mr. Rochester absolutely isn't! And Zelah was just, well, weird, a bit of a mixed couple. In his favor, the supporting cast was pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of adaptation, but overall they didn't capture the magic of the novel. Certainly do not ask anyone to look at it as a true adaptation of the novel. A real disappointment!
