The plot of Descent, if it can actually be called a plot, has two noteworthy events. One near the beginning - one at the end. Together these events constitute perhaps 5% of the total time of the film. Everything (and I mean everything) is essentially the director's desperate effort to fill the minutes. I like scary movies, I like dark movies and I don't disturb gritty scenes - but if you expect me to go through 60 minutes of gloomy / dark (literally) scenes without plot, you have another thing coming. Rosario Dawson, one of my favorite actresses, is completely wasted here. And no, do not get naked, not even in the NC-17 version, which I saw. <br /> <br /> If you have a couple of hours to throw away and you want to see "Descent", take a nap instead - you'll probably have more interesting dreams.
