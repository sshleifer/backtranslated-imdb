My title should be enough. <br /> <br /> It baffles me that a culture so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) can churn out tosh like the "nouvelle vague" cinema movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic lucidity and intelligent philosophy. But the moment you give him a camera, they start behaving like WOOOHOOO WATCH HOW I CAN BE POSSIBLE! TO TRACK? THEME? Pshaw! WE PROPOSE AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GOING ROUND & ROUND FILM! At least that's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy charm with the shoulders of people's heads. Oh-la-la, that artist.). No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But so is the security camera in a quickie-mart. The two are indistinguishable. <br /> <br /> Haha, just like a spell for all those who complain about movie school nerds: I bet the vein is popping out of your neck right now. But don't leave without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> However, if you like French literature, you will hate it. People who like this movie have probably never read any book except the ramblings of Jack Kerouac or perhaps "Galactic Guide to Hitchhikers". Or maybe they read the lyrics to The Doors songs, and they think it's deeply moving. Whatever you let your boat float. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the most beautiful and significant writers who ever lived. Nice try, truffles. But you're not even close to the baseball field. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film like a syringe infected with AIDS. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you are an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for heaven's sake push that vein into your neck. You look like a cabbage.
