Although I am generally a supporter of the well-made film, I do not limit myself to films that escape those boundaries, and most of the time I like and admire films that "break the rules" successfully. And it is really true that the director Pasolini breaks the rules of the affirmed cinema. But it is also my opinion that it does not break them successfully or in any way. <br /> <br /> Pasolini's work is visually off-key, but this is less a question of what is really on the screen than how it is filmed, and the nervousness of his films seems less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true for DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors did so with remarkable results, under Pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This also applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often includes images designed to shock, offend or otherwise baffle the public. Such elements can often be used with a surprising effect, but in Pasolini's hands these elements rarely seem to actually contribute to the film. This is also true for DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who like, even admire Pasolini's films. Nevertheless, I have never met any of them, and I never knew anything about Pasolini or his works that made me understand the reason for such appreciation or admiration. Judging from his works alone, I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateur director who did not "break the rules" either by choice but by lack of skill - and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his days for "existential audacity", therefore simply confirming it in the bad habits of a director. I find his work boring, unattractive and pretentious. And this is also true for DECAMERON. It is also, unfortunately, true of almost all of Pasolini's films that it was my misfortune to endure.
