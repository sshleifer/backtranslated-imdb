I feel totally ripped off. Someone has to pay back the $ 4.95 I spent at Blockbuster to rent this homemade mess. This is NOT a musical it is a complete waste of time and my evening. What I don't understand is why this was distributed in the first place ??? ... Someone MUST have done some heavy medications the night the deal was made. I've seen better movies coming out of film schools and I've been to film school, so I can say it's a fact. The quality of this work is also VERY bad to see ... shot on DV ??? Nuff said. The songs are not songs but just jokes that sound the same in each section. Want to see a good musical? THEN DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE.
