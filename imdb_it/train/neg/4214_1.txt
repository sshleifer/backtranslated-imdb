Having just lost a couple of hours watching this and 80% of that time in complete disbelief, I can give this garbage the prize for the year's turkey, without any problems. To say that the plot was incredible is a bit of an understatement. Frankly I'm lost for words to describe this tripe. Not only are the characters completely and completely without any semblance of originality (this kind of thing was done much better in dozens of "serial killer movies") but the acting was terrible. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money, for those who have been paid to do so, I hope you return your money back. Believe me folks there are many new releases out there that are much, much better. Go look.
