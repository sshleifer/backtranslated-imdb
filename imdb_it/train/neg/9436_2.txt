Unhinged follows the typical pattern of the slasher trend of the 80s. Beautiful girls in danger. I have to give up the director who used a helicopter for some of the first travel shots, actually you think for a second that there will be quality in production. Watching "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur acting class go through its warm up. Some of the most clunky, poorly lit and too long scenes take place with the taste of a Valium overdose. I wondered why they didn't just put playing cards on the camera so the actresses didn't have to keep looking. The two main girls were obviously chosen for their T & A factor rather than talent. Laurel Munson as the main chick Terry is as exciting as looking at the dried paint. Two nude scenes create an adolescent thrill. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy / creepy daughter and mother the chicks find themselves stuck competing for the worst acting ever. Long pauses, strange expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and it's a delight for those of us out there who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly change with long blackouts where you can drive a Mack truck. Cartoon lightning crashes through the shots without even bothering to show the sky. The eighties eyeshadow assaults the viewer. But you know, he grew up on me. I was sorry for this. I wanted to hug him, kiss him is boo-boo and make him better. The finish does not compensate for the damage caused but I still smile. I have my theories about the whole "forbidden" hype and I hope that anyone who chooses to see this film does so with substantial substance abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise it passes.
