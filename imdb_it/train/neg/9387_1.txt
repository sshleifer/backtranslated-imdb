I saw this movie when it was released for the first time. The memory of how bad he was remained with me for almost forty years. I didn't want to trust my feelings about the film when I saw it, so I consulted a film review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day - the reviewer confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the film was inconsistent, indecipherable and uninteresting . A little research reveals that the producer was the husband of star Leslie Caron, so the smell of nepotism suggests the beginning of this terrible movie. The roster of the film of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking among others - suggests that he keeps some promises. But the death of this film is attributable to his terrible script. The "mystery" involved is so obscure and so little revealed in the film that the viewer remains perplexed from one scene to another. The film seems divided between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller, but it is never satisfied with one or the other. The sense of suspense is completely absent. The main characters are content to play dry types, devoid of emotions in a way that does not inspire any empathy. Cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the unlucky spectator loses interest in the characters, the plot and, in the end, the film itself. I am surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available for purchase. I hope that if TCM finds a print of this film and feels compelled to send it on the air, it will be relegated to the 4:00 slot safely.
