This low-budget B horror storyline comes with all the comforts: a mad scientist complete with an assistant, corporate greed of the pharmaceutical industry, eccentric and extreme genetic engineering and information technology .... I can't leave him out. <br /> <br /> Start with a strange sequence of nameless, frowning boatmen who foolishly decide to take a dip in the waters near an unexplored island and end up with a friend for swarms of hammerheads. . <br /> <br /> Cut to a weak retrospective story that implies the decline of the shares of a generic pharmaceutical company that motivates its evil Shakespeare by citing the CEO to entertain an unsolicited offer made by a former employee / scientist who is been excluded from his work as head of research and that he is also a nut ... of course (total Herbert West aspirant). He is offering a new stem cell technology that could make tons of money ... or so it seems ... This attracts many employees to his island of Moreau-ish (it must have been a pretty awesome package for the company when he was let go to afford an island) to validate his scientific discoveries including the CEO and, coincidentally, the ex-boyfriend of the mad scientist's son now turned into sharkuman (how convenient) .... <br / > <The plan, in a certain sense, is to rekindle the love lost between the previous wedding while revenge is demanded for former colleagues for his termination. (Sheez, how can this guy be bitter? He has his whole island friggen ...). <br /> <br /> Soon, everyone is on the run (from the endless supply of security guards armed with heavy weapons, from the mutant plants can there be an unexplored island without man-eating plants?, from the appetite of the shark son to the carnage, from the charlatan breeding plans and the lack of a cellphone signal) ... and everyone must learn to work together to get out of the island alive! <br /> <br /> Will anyone escape? Will a new species be created? Look at it and find out. <br /> <br /> There is some entertainment value in this movie, but don't expect much ... for the real Combs fan, this is not to be missed. <br /> <br /> Don't say I didn't warn you.
