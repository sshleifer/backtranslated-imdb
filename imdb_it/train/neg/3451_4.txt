Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal western actor. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden Arm are proof of this, but he didn't have the body of a western hero, you identified him as an urban boy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a box office failure wasn't his fault. I blame two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than a hero throughout the film. In a genre where people expect a certain model, the film must be very good to break away from it. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that an entire city will allow Sinatra to do whatever he wants just because he is afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special holster that opens sideways so you don't pull the gun you wonder if this will make him invincible, why haven't all the gunslingers adopted him? I think this film should not have been withdrawn, because every movie with Sinatra is worth seeing, and despite its flaws it is still enjoyable
