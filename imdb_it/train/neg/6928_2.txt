All the other comments have already said what I was going to say, here it goes anyway. At first I thought it was Italian, I'm sorry, Italy. I wasn't bored because I kept waiting for something to happen. Who wrote that song about Dr. Tarr and Professor Feather when? Was it Alan Parsons? I saw this on a Brentwood 10 package and the quality was as expected, terrible. Full of streaks and stuff. The film was an inconsistent disaster. Goofy music and characters without tracks. The principal should have known in the first minute that the doctor was crazier than the patients. I thought the "doctor" who ran the "battle" scene would never end. He had some nice girls though. It seems that these stupid ass movies always throw in a naked girl or two and this drives you crazy. I gave a 2 for nekkid women. That bird that people dance made me want to pull my eyes out. Poe probably did about 3000 rpm in his grave when this thing came out because it was freely based on his story.
