The satirical novel of Tom Wolfe's life, beautifully observed and brilliantly observed among New York snobbery, has a polished appearance but is not well served. The film does not simply suffer from the miscellany of every man Tom Hanks in the role of an indifferent Yuppie, the Kewpie doll Melanie Griffith as a manipulator of the south and Bruce Willis (?!) As the dear one of the literati of New York. The most serious misrepresentation was in the director's chair. Robert Altman could have created these unlikely characters and made them interesting, but Brian De Palma, for all his visual refinement, never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience. The resulting film looks good, but it seems blah to its subject of dehumanization in favor of status. Honestly, if a satire doesn't upset the viewer, what's the point?
