In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) was beheaded and his lover Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) was tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before dying, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In our days (in the 70s), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) participate in a session of session, in which evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to go to the Ville de Sade, a real estate of the Hugo family in the countryside, to look for a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find the head of Alaric and the demon possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and performing the premises with blood sacrifices. After his father's death, Elvira (Emma Cohen) remembers having the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demonic Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. <br /> <br /> Last weekend I bought a horror genre box with five Paul Naschy DVDs for US $ 9.98; although I had no references, I decided to risk it. The first DVD with the complete and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a junk movie B (or C) that made me immediately remember Ed Wood. The ridiculous story is revealed through the terrible script, direction, performance, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with many naked women. The result is simply exhilarating and I can guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
