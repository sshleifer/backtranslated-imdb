Wow! Only such a ridiculous film could inspire the similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? The indescribably horrible theme song? Pia Zadora's non-expressions throughout the film? The fact is that despite being set in Los Angeles, or "the land of the launch couch" EVERY single man (and woman!) Is being made a fool asleep with Pia Zadora, with any artificial means necessary? Or what about the fact that every person in the film is totally unpleasant because he is either stupidly stupid (Pia) or disgustingly despicable sleazeball (all the others)? And since this film was written by real "writers" (sort), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the film industry (who the hell would have admired and kissed up to SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br / > But it is (unintentionally) funny as hell though. The "breakdown" scene alone will make you giggle, and after seeing the climatic scene "I'm not the only one who had to **** his way to the top" to the "Awards" (all done in the usual level of business acting that we expect from quality actors like Pia), I sincerely hope our dear Pia actually reused that speech when she "won" her Golden Globe. make my day. <br /> <br /> However, if you're a fan of the ugly, eye-catching field, try this otherwise nasty movie.
