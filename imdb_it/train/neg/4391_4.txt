A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing the scientific research of his late father on the regeneration of the limbs with flying colors, but his mother, who interferes dominantly, and his lover doctor want to sell serum. When he finds out, there is an incident involving Harry losing an arm. So try the serum and what event is a genetically unbalanced arm that has its own mind. <br /> <br /> Oh, we've seen it so many times before, but what brings up this very campy and fairly rubbery shonky junk is the performance of the movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. In reality it is not a bad movie from Fangoria's movies; only there are better ones out there, which are similar in the vein. "Servered Ties" simply does not have its own distinctive style. The strange nature and the unpleasant splatter resembled "Re-animator" and even a touch of slapstick like something from "Evil Dead 2". <br /> <br /> The comic book story is really stunned with its black humor, but it can become melodramatic and a bit dry in the fun factor. Surprises emerge, in particular the final result of the film. Which is well accepted, since I thought it could have been eliminated with something more accessible. For low-budget production, FX makeup may seem stiff and silly, but there are some grotesque moments that will make you smile rather than shudder. Even a stroke of sexual tension slims the story, thanks to the severe performance of Elke Sommer as a mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously impassive in an evil sense and pulls it off very well. Both were enjoying themselves immensely like the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in an irregular performance like Harry. Director Damon Santostefano vividly tackles the film and orchestrates some fashionable scenes of compelling and compelling horrors. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is a juvenile and fundamentally silly absurdity, but you have to give it to yourself for less demanding entertainment.
