I've been a big wrestling fan since I was eight. It doesn't matter which federation I saw. WWE, WCW, USWA. For me, action is everything I looked at for it. <br /> <br /> May 23, 1999. It was my 19th birthday. I ordered Over the Edge and only expected another pay per view. But this time. I was wrong. Instead that was the night when one of the best wrestlers came out of Canada a real human fell to the ground due to a stunt gone wrong. There is not much you can do to change the situation. But what happened when I grabbed Owens' death made me very angry. <br /> <br /> Rather than ending the pay-per-view and doing the right thing as human beings WWE has decided to protect what comes first and that was money keeping paying to see as if Owens's death does not had never happened. <br /> <br /> I have to tell you, Vince Mchmaon made some stupid decisions in his life, but this was by far the stupidest decision I ever made. <br /> <br /> And this crap with the said Owen would have liked the landscape of the pagans to continue. Give me a break. When someone dies on a dock, he pays his comonte sense to stop it. It is like a policeman shooting a thief or a robber with a run and then letting the man die to be able to go home and call him a day as if man's life didn't matter. <br /> <br /> But no matter what happens Owen will be missed and thank you for the memories of all the times you gave us.
