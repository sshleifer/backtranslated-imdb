I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, whose book is based on this film. Unfortunately the director was unable to translate the book on the screen. The novel is completely postmodern and highly artificial in his wildly exaggerated characters and in the disintegration of the traditional plot and character development. It is an exhilarating examination of human greed, the excess and emptiness of one of the most moralistic contemporary British writers. The film's director has completely lost the point of the novel. In his hands, the film screams at breakneck speed, indulging in every known twist and "odd" viewing angle possible. It is as if Ken Russel were acid, and he suffers from the self-indulgence of that old director to a hundred. Not even the (short) vision of the magnificent actor Christian Solimeno's penis was enough to save this miserable film for me. Abysmal!
