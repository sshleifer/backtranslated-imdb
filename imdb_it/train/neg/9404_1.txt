This absolute junk is based so closely on the Friday 13th series which is practically a carbon copy, it accepts to be an Australian film with people who can't act. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time there was a guy accidentally burned while shooting a music video at Lake Eildon. Now, a number of years later, the boy grew up and takes revenge on anyone who comes to the lake to film a music video. It is a clich√© and a waste of time and money, it is only seen out of curiosity or if you are an aspiring actor who tries to learn how NOT to act (not being able to do it). The lead role Alan Dale was the protagonist of the television soap opera Neighbors, but ended up on The X Files: how did it happen?
