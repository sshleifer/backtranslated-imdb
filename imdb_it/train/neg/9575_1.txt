First we start by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be praised for being associated with this piece of drivel. I had to give this 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. Do you want to know how bad this movie is? my mother calls me from the other side of the city and tells me "son, I just watched the most stupid movie ever, I replied saying" the murderous tongue eh? "was how did you know? this movie is so bad. It looked like a good movie firstly Freddy pinhead Melinda, okay, I'll give it a chance, I sat through the rest of this movie just because I wrote a column for movie reviews of horror, I beg you, don't waste your time in money or even brain cells in this ridiculous piece of shit, run away far away, if you see it on the shelf of the blockbuster Hollywood movie or even in your local video store, turn it around and leave ... and I still want my two hours back to do it
