The perfect murder is foiled when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who directed this episode), who kills her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor while she is about to move the body outside ... a crazy mad escaped dressed in a Santa suit (played by a sneaky Larry Drake). He takes care of his life as he tries to find a way to hide his husband's body. He decides to use an ax, once he kills Santa's murderer who loses many opportunities to cut off the woman's head, to frame the murderer for her husband's murder. Santa Killer closes her in a closet and chases the woman's daughter as she tries desperately to free herself to save the child. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT recycles only the tired material involving the old "Santa Claus" theme while also adding the frequent (added to the nausea) woman-murderers-her-husband-for-one -man-she-has-been-cheated with the routine. It is essentially Trainor who tries to find a way to avoid being caught with a corpse that kills while maintaining a safe distance from a maniac. There is nothing refreshing or new in this plot that practically goes through the movements. Not one of the show's highlights.
