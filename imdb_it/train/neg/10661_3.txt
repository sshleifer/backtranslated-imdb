It is "The F.B.I." played by Reed Hadley, with an all-star guest cast! The film begins with a (comfortable?) Casual kidnapping, which leads to one thing and another - which in reality do not indicate the main story, which is a "Big House, United States of America". prison history. The story is very unlikely, to say the least. It's like a TV show, only more "violent" (for the times). <br /> <br /> BUT - the cast is a journey! Imagine this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his cell mates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a magazine "Muscle"!), and William Talman (reading a magazine "Detective"!). Honest! You should know, a first scene reveals what happens to the "missing" boy, answering "voiceover" at the end. If you don't want to have that hanging, don't miss the opening scenes between "Iceman" and the guy (Peter Votrian is doing well as an asthmatic out of control). <br /> <br /> *** Big House, U.S.A. (1955) Howard W. Koch ~ Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
