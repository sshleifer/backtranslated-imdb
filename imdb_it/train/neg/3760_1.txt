This is the biggest piece of lamo I've ever seen. It's terribly boring that I would have preferred a seminar on creationism than having seen it if I had known it would be as boring as it was. Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in a bikini with the big table redeems this something lower than a 1. <br /> <br /> The reviews of this film that claim that this film is "unintentionally funny" are absurd just wrong. Nothing is fun in this movie. spend the first 50 minutes walking in the woods talking about things you wouldn't understand and don't worry about and it's just as lame when people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING. Honestly, I haven't looked at it until the end, but this should say something about how horrible it is. WORST MOVIE EVER. <br /> <br /> Immediately after expelling this filth from my DVD player, I started to scratch it against the cement in front of my house, not wanting other successful customers to fall back on the same mistake I had made renting this movie. Then Zach took a pee. Thank you for your time.
