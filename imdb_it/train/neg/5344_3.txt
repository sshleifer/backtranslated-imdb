Do you remember the movie Spice Girls and how bad it was (besides the songs), even their manager Simon Fuller (also the manager of this band) makes the same mistake in putting his S Club (another of my favorite bands) in own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) In practice they ask their boss for a break, they go on and while they are there they are watched TV! Three of them exchange, and vice versa, half discover that they are clones made by an avid scientist, and the other half gets into trouble. He also played Gareth Gates as a clone of himself. This film could have a bigger plot than the Spice Girls movie, but besides the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream True" is not a goo reason to watch this movie. Not long after the band split up forever. Adequate!
