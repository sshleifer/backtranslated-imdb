I saw this movie for the first time on MST3K. And even though I laughed my back at the jokes, I don't think this movie was that bad. Of course it was a bit difficult to understand that it is obviously a low budget, but it had a plot very similar to Hitchcock and I can honestly say that when I saw the non-MST3K version, I was genuinely entertained. This movie is asking for a Hollywood remake.
