Extraordinary slasher film by Producer Charles Band. In the days of the biggest success of the Full Moon Band he said he would never make "real killer movies" because he felt that small puppets and big monsters added an element of fantasy that made films better - the people who killed themselves were so real and less funny. A beautiful philosophy and a real pity that Band, after destroying Full Moon's studio through possible bad deals, has become so desperate for the profits of the home cinema that he started to realize exactly what Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this also worked on "Delta Delta Die!" and "Birth Rite" - both equally insignificant by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is usual at the top as a novice in a band of dudes and dudettes who decide to invent a story about a "killer club". She - as one would obviously do - does everything possible to unite and then panics because it was not a true story and the stupid Mrs. Rochon believed it and now everyone will have to run running in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not. The choice is that there is and as far as this film is concerned it is yours ... not recommended but not entirely negative.
