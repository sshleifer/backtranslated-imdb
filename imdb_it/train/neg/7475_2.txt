To be honest, I knew what to expect before seeing this movie, and I have to say that it has the worst acting I've ever seen. It has its moments and, at a comic level, it is very funny, but I fear that it is not scary and that stupidity is taken to a new level. There is a lot of useless blood, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why the aliens were evil and why they came to this remote part of Wales, (I mean, who would have gone there anyway?), But at that point I didn't care, because I enjoyed the customs and the bad CGI . As for the B films, this deserves the title of "being so bad, it's good" and compliments the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. For a long time these films continue .....
