First of all, when I saw the Wendy Wu teaser trailer, I was definitely excited. Brenda Song, one of the hottest Disney Channel girls, would do martial arts and I was okay with this ... until I saw the movie. The action was badly constructed, the film could not have realized for anyone, the fight was unrealistic and it sucked ... along with the plot. If you really think that he is an aspiring Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl wants to ignore her vocation and wants to become the queen of the homecoming, the observer who is she insect prepare for a great fight against ancient evil. The idea was not so original, the film is a waste of time.
