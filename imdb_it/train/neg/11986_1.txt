What a horrible writing and acting. No personality What, can't you make a good movie with a single character? Hmm, it was done in Castaway with personal dialogue. <br /> <br /> So this guy goes on a trip to see his father. The boy, Jason, takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies in mid-air. Then the child crashes into a lake and survives. Then he runs around, survives in the desert until he is saved. <br /> <br /> During this time he fights a bear twice. The first time he fights in the lake. The second time he makes a spear from a branch and throws the bear. Two shots of fake blood leaking from the bear's chest reminded me of "The Holy Grail" by Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Even the child decides to kick a hedgehog with predictable results. <br /> <br /> gag.
