The machines in this film are fantastic. The acting in this film is terrible. The plot and the driving scenes do not make much sense and are equally bad. If you really feel annoyed by movies where someone changes and suddenly becomes faster, save the problem and the money. A good movie for racing fans? Well, there's a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can't tell, go look at it, you'll have a great time. This is really it, there are really really nice machines in this movie, they are driven horribly and completely unrealistic. The acting is horrible mainly due to the extremely negative plot. If you want to see sexy girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I'm disappointed that such beautiful machines would have been represented in such a bad film. If the class of machines matches that of the film, they should run with rusty bicycles.
