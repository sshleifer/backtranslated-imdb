I don't usually go out of a movie, but halfway through I did. Did this film promise something different, but I kept thinking that I hadn't seen it before? Spoiler Alert! Back in 1, the spaceship crashes and lands on the ground, well, all these years later, with a super adult on board no less, this thing still manages to burn and crash! What, this advanced civilization does not seem to develop the landing gear? For such a liberal industry, we can see another Woody Allen movie, no blacks please! Superman runs around to save people, making sure they stick to Europe and the United States, don't go into dark areas please. Maybe I could stand it about 30 years ago, but now now.
