This first Adam Sandler film could be compared to his comic life during the same period in 1989. The constant recognition of the character of his hidden comic genius and his frustration with humorous material seems to derive more from Sandler than from the script. The film is nothing compared to his successful films, such as Big Daddy or even the trivial Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a coherent, successful and enjoyable way when this film was made, just like his character. Most of the "jokes" of the film come from Sandler who has conversations with himself, usually about his unrecognized comedic talent and he beats himself because he is too ugly and cannot have women. Even the film is hard to watch because it is not like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately embarrassing and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget that I had seen this movie even after it was finished, for fear that if I discovered something more, it would ruin Sandler's career. Pass this to the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
