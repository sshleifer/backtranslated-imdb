Hobgoblin .... Hobgoblin .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This film gives Manos - The Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst movie ever made. This is fun to laugh, where Manos was painful to watch. The hobgoblin will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze". The acting (and I'm using this term freely) is atrocious, the Hobgoblin are some of the worst puppets you can ever see, and the garden tool fight must be seen to be believed. The film was the perfect vehicle for MST3K, and that version is the only way to see this mess. This movie gives Mike and the robots plenty of ammunition to shoot some of the funniest liners they've ever made. If you try to watch this without the help of Mike and the robots ... God helps you !!
