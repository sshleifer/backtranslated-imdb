I might not be a critic, but here's what I think of this movie. Well, I've just seen the movie on cinemax and first of all I just have to say how much I hate the storyline, I mean, what makes a snowman scare apart from the little kids, secondly it's pretty bloody, but I bet the movie costs so little they probably used ketchup so MY CRITICAL VOTE IS BOMB !!! nice try and the sequel will suck double.
