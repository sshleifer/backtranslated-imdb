Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner in what he called a good science fiction movie, Nemesis. So, as we watched it, we found ourselves making it through parts of the BS drama just to get to the incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to kick, kick and kick. And he kicks! haha <br /> <br /> The character of Gruner is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto near the one in which he grew up. He finds himself looking after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join the Mexican band that continues to torment his family. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to react (against a gang? Too crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or gets them pretty mean) and works to free his block from these gang members. <br /> <br /> The plot was very rough and easy to think. Probably Gruner is not very well known because of his script: choosing whether this film is something to compare the possible choices. This ghetto is a real hell and I enjoyed watching the heterogeneous group of characters cross it as if they had a chance against the Gruner character. The music was typical of action music (piano beats and timpani, swelling guitars) that really wasn't as bad as I play. The director really needed to continue the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action movie for Oliver Gruner to act in, but the overall feel of the movie lets you want more closure on what you just saw.
