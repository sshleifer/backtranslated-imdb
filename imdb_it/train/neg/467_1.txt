There are bad movies, terrible movies and even boring movies ... I can watch most and make up for it until the end, not this time. Avoid this like the plague, the annoying music everywhere, the terrible montage, no comedy, its more sticky than a cup of novelty ... My lady wanted to see this thinking that it would be Legally Blonde material or something like watchable, but never better than average, chicken shot. It is the first time he begged me to press the stop button. <br /> <br /> The girls, well, they weren't perfect to start with (Denise did well in Starship Troopers and Wild Things) but you sank the gravel I feel like a cup after spending 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after a lot of construction work on his face. <br /> <br /> Take my advice if you want to avoid wasting precious oxygen and brain cells ranting on the chop that is on your screen.
