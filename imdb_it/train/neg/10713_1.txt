Come on, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar, as they are commonly called, did not even exist until the early twelfth century. The story is so ridiculous that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren looked really bored. Also, if you want to have a real-life template, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who are still present in Portugal. At least they should have taken history into consideration. The only redeeming quality I found in this film is that the artifacts seemed authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic period pieces. The acting was bad, the scary plot, the horrible action and the props were in place.
