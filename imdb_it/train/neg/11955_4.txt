"Visitor Q" is a failed attempt at black comedy that focuses on what could be the most dysfunctional family in the world including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy, necrophilia, to a nursing mother nursing her adult husband and daughter, etc. the film is so outrageous that it has garnered some praise and established a small following. However, with the quality of the home video and a slapdash production, "Visitor Q" does not even stand out of curiosity. The genitals are blurred and the sanitary appliances are clearly visible, the makeup is horrible and everything else is amateur at best. A waste of time. (C-)
