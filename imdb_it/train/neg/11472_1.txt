Everything about this film was terrible. To start with, this film has had a pretty good cast and I find it impossible to make such a big cast in the biggest disaster of the gangster movie genre ever. The soundtrack was like one of the bad slap comedies. He had this music throughout the film and he started to get pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT AFFECT YOUR DISASTER, IT WILL ONLY BE DONE
