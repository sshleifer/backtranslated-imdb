I like Jane Austin's novels. I love the Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm halfway to Mansfield Park. But I couldn't stand Emma. I gave up the book after 2 chapters and at the end of the film I didn't care less about Emma. It didn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows who acted (which is excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest in the film. Boh. <br /> <br /> The costumes are beautiful, but the dance was clumsy compared to that of Pride and Prejudice by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> I basically gave a 2 for the fact that Knightly is damned gorgeous, and although it's a rather fragmentary performance for Ewan McGregor, I liked his singing style.
