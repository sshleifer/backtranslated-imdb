So Angela grew up and started a therapy and an operation to turn her into a real daughter, rather than the child she was born, and now she has a job like - wait - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. However, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels: more blood, more imaginative killings (which are not fanciful, but still more than original), more nudity, a more elaborate plot in general worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It's fun in the same way as the original, as the characters and closets are so stupid and so authentically 80's that you can't help but laugh. At one point, a guy asks Angela to go out, and she says "I'll call you" and then she quickly goes away. The boy says to himself: "What will you call me? I don't have a phone!" and then sniffs his armpits, wondering what made her move away (it's her hair, friend !!). It is known that in the 1980s murdered films were more often not punished by their murderer for some kind of bad behavior, usually to be too promiscuous. When I started getting into horror movies and saw the 13th Friday movie in the mid-90s for the first time, I didn't realize it. I learned it in a film course a year or two later and was amazed that theirs was a method for madness. I was very impressed, not only that the films conveyed a sort of message, even if morbid, but that in reality it had been thought of. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point, just before Angela killed one of her victims, she said "Let it be a lesson for you, say no to drugs!" Real thin screen that writes there, guys. Then again, dialogue is the funniest thing in the film. Angela (who, among other things, passed all that therapy and those operations and all those problems to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to, umm, Angela) at one point he says, "I don't like being the wicked witch of the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control." (People start to be killed ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Then, later, he asks one of the advisors, Mare, to apologize, to whom the girl replies, "I'd rather die! " Sorry, Mare, but you really got into that ... Two years ago I was a camp counselor in a field for the elderly similar to the one depicted in this film (except for the field I was teaching a had more than three children for the 15 or 20 advisers and also had rules, which the film does not have). This pointed out to me the myriad discrepancies in the film from what is the life of the camp. <br /> <br /> Okay, though, it's hard to make a film like this with a lot of 9-year-old kids running, even though there were 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie. I had never seen that kind of thing before. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for a poor 80s slasher film ....
