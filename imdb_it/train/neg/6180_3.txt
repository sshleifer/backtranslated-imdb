I attended one of the previews last night and I have the following comments: <br /> <br /> 1. Just because you directed a ton of music videos it DOES NOT make you qualified to make films. The film had an overabundance of persistent hits that made no sense, horrible angles and terrible lights. The assembly did not help this mess at all. When "Dixie" gets late for the funeral service, her mother talks to her about her hand, but it's never clear what the hell she's talking about. <br /> <br /> 2. The plot was promising, but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck holes. We never understand what drives the characters, what is really behind the conflicts they all have together or exactly how they resolve them. Sixteen years later they are wiped out in 4 days, apparently by magic. The deep conversations were marked by stupid clichés. (Actually, the whole city was a great cliché of southern life.) Half the audience groaned when Toby drawled "Ya blew the blood in my veins" ... and we were treated with that insipid line not once , but TWICE! The revelations were yawning, and the dramatic confessions were reduced to "I was stupid and stubborn". <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was okay considering the wreckage of a script they had to work with. Toby was dark and meditated for most of the film, but when he smiled and lit it was fascinating. It's a pity he didn't have more time on screen like that. Kelly Preston's acting ribs are rather rusty and proves. Lindsay Haun is talented and it is certainly not her fault that the writers made her character so unlikely at the beginning that she did not blame her father for not having come looking for her. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper managed to make more of this film, but they seemed more or less lost. (And indeed, their characters get lost in this movie!) <br /> <br /> 4. If you are a Toby fan you will love the songs. But often the film felt as if a scene was forced just so that they could exhibit one of his songs - or the artists on his record label. For example, the official love song of the film is "Crash Here Tonight". You would think it would sound in a tender love scene, but no ... we hear about 45 seconds of it while it is heading for a funeral service. It was like they said "well, we have to use this song somewhere". The song "Broken" is disturbing and the best thing to get out of this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary ... a promising storyline never develops completely and the film is horribly erratic as it forcibly attempts to be a vehicle for the music and product placement of Toby Keith for Ford Trucks. It goes from being people who rebuild broken bridges to try to talk about the power of music, but the story is told so badly that both points are lost in this overgrown music video. I like Toby and I really wanted "Broken Bridges", but the people he was counting on to make this film disappointed him and deserve one of his famous boots, you know where.
