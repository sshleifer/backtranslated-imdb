My interest in Dorothy Stratten led me to buy this video. Although he had great actors / actresses, there were too many subplots going on to keep interest. Besides, it wasn't that interesting. The dialogue was rigid and confused and the plot turned too much to be credible. I was pretty disappointed in what I believe was one of Audrey Hepburn's last films. I always love John Ritter as the best in slapstick. He was too pathetic here.
