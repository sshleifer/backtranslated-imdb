Some wonder why Mrs. Murphy's films were not there after this. Maybe because this movie has completely wiped out the snot. Disney was not the right studio to shoot this film. MAYBE Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but would be more adult). The film is too playful, as the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the characters. The characters do not act as in books. And why did Tucker change with a boy? It's a girl in frying books! Was it made to make the movie attractive to boys? Sheesh. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow her job was wrong. An animated film, perhaps in the blizzard of Don Bluth's artwork, would be good for a better film than Mrs. Murphy. Overall, I gave this 2, because at least Disney made a film from a series of little-liked books. But, I wish they did better. Anyway, I still have my books to entertain me.
