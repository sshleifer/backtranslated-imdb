Personally I hated this film because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped and the whole idea was a rip off of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is a crazy girl who is sent to a place where she does not belong. The whole place hates her, and to make it worse there's a hot guy who apparently doesn't like it (well, the whole damn school can't stand you). Surprisingly, he finds a way to adapt and make everyone like it, and makes the boy fall madly in love with her. Then comes the choice, where you have to choose between figure skating and hockey. He chooses hockey, so he turns to figure skating citizens and arrives at the Olympic team. No real surprise there. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was so damn predictable. You knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so horrible that I almost vomited, and when I finished watching it, I had a terrible headache and the urge to shoot myself for looking at that bullshit. Don't look at this unless you're under ten or actually prefer crappy tween movies.
