This film could have weak production values, but it is also what makes it so good. The special effects are coarse and well made. My favorite part of the film was to be Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. He's super sexy and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as head of the band is hilarious, as are the other members. This film is actually trying to make a point, saying that nuclear power plants are bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, misleading film.
