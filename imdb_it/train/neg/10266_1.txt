1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10 (Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash from the 70s allegedly horror films like Friday 13 (versions 1 to 6). Can't think of something redeemed here except (or can I think of something?)? The story revolves around a group of stupid people who listen to a radio show a year after some children were killed in the woods as a "tribute" to this, presumably. But here, one of the stupid people, has ties to the real event because her sister was one of those killed (again, how stupid is she to be part of it). Guess what? The killer is underway again and we are understood from the start who he is (so there is no mystery). And besides all this, where are the "policemen" and why nobody calls them. I can't believe this film was funded by someone and made. One might think that by now the Americans would be judged a bit taller, at least in their film experience, but not so by this director.
