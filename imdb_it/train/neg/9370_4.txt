Although this is not a "great film", there is something compelling and memorable. As another commentator on the film, I saw him in childhood. Thirty-three years have passed since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously bulky title. Look at it if you have the opportunity. You will feel like a voyeur of small town life as it evolves through the decades. More than any other film, this brings a human face to the historical drama of the "progress" of the early twentieth century. It's quite engaging for a young viewer and memorable enough for a more adult one. Moreover, it is easy to appreciate the characters and observe their passage through time.
