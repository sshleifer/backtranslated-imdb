Who ever wrote the two or three rave reviews or were involved in the making of this film, a term used inaccurately, or in a bank, and if that were the case, I would like to get my seven dollars back! The actors, again roughly used, are horrible, in fact almost none of them has ever done anything new, which is a relief. The scenery and everything related to these screams, we had 7 dollars to work and a day to do it. Was it filmed in someone's backyard? Everything about this project says: low budget. At best, the actors were the list D. Don't waste your time, unless, of course, you want to take it back and try to get the rental back. The front-line bad guy looks like the punk from the 1970s show who ended up marrying his grandmother to Dummee Moore. My local blockbuster video store lists it as the most returned movie with a sad comment attached. Even as a 99 cent rental, this film collects dust. Someone really needs to have favors. This is a super stinker and I give him 10 turds.
