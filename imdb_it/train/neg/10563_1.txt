The time spent watching this film was a waste of time. I don't like science fiction. I don't reject any genre by itself, since a good job can be done in any genre. This film, however, is not a good job. I can't fault the graphics (when I don't involve alien tricks), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not entirely out of place, for a trekkish comic. But fx images were obviously where the interest / attention / money of all producers was going. The direction alternated between slow and confused (he was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom in at least one crucial moment). The "acting" was indeed very bad. There was no basis for most of the line readings besides a suggestion of "It was so on the page and the director told me I had to be crazy / sad / scared / whatever .. Okay, so he was a pilot SF series Since when is this an excuse for poor corrosiveness in areas that should be considered essential for a dramatic medium, am I surprised that the pilot sold the series or the money either in the hands of a technician?
