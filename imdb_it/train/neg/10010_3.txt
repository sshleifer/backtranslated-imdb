The plot is not worth discussing even though it alludes to corruption, murder, power and the rest of the thriller-related topics. The characters are interesting though sometimes. Not realistic but still interesting. <br /> <br /> Development is as slow as the tea drinking ceremony. Not amazing images, but good enough to facilitate eye strain. Nice movie to watch after dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking, nothing exciting. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody: excellent performance. Had to fight the inadequacy of the plot and did the job quite well. The rest is bearable even if very predictable. Everything is watchable and better than most TV shows.
