I saw it. It is not "good" but interesting in a minimal way. The boys are rather naturalists but ............ the graphic / free scene of the final group rape is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of movies of the second world war is offensive the way in which tries to compare the real horror with this misogynist artifice. The real atrocity is real - this film is just atrocious. However, the film has a look that can attract you. But it seems to me that they are the "new clothes of the emperor", but in reality on the contrary. The film looks beautiful, but the direction, the plot, the content and the final feeling that you take away from this film are empty. If a feeling can be empty, this is it.
