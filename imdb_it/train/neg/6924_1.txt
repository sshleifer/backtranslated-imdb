If this film were worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This senseless disaster makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I saw this steaming pile, but I remember I wanted to do serious physical damage to everyone involved. As anyone can give this movie more than 1 star amazes me with the grace of all those who have seen this tripe. I give him a star because there is no lower rating. All copies of this film should be burned on the ground sown with salt and reserved as a dump for the most toxic waste. No, a copy should be kept under ultra hi security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do it.
