Wow ... what can I say ... First of all, IMDb says it's in the late 60s ... which means Carlito would be very close to going to jail, he came out in 75 and said he was in 5 years. They used a group of actors none, and a story that didn't even make sense. Only one actor returns, Guzman, and hes playing a completely different guy. Why did he end up with him and this Puerto Rican girl? Where is Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Where is Kleinfeld? He said he had always known him ... You would think he would be in this. And if this made sense, where is Rocco and the black guy in the first? It was all just stupid ... This is an insult to Pacino and the first movie.
