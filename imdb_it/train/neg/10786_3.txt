The way this film was made with so many great stars is beyond me. This is a terrible clich√© about the "ridden" movie with the worst acting one of these actors ever did. It really surprises me that so many of these A-series stars agree with this inexpensive movie. What's even worse is the fact that nearly 100 million has been made here in the states. However, it goes to show that the big stars can pull in the dollars, even if the film is terrible. I was sorry for all those involved in this party of Russians. Billy Crystal did his best with what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to walk for the movements. Whatever you do, don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this.
