I shouldn't even review this film, since it's not really a horror movie - and therefore not worthy of Dr. Cheese's attention. At least, it is not the horror in the usual sense. It is certainly a terrifying proposal to waste your time looking at this shit. That's why I turned it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise, then, when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed. Yes, it's true; Put simply, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> "The Order" had many flaws, not all of them unique. In particular, it seems to me that the main problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's reluctance to involve Christianity in its own terms. It is possible to make truly gruesome and even orthodox films. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, films like this are just a mixture of filmmaker fantasies (usually boring and illogical). <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone has made a film apparently about, for example, physics, but not only has the fundamental laws of physics wrong, but based the whole plot on his wrong portraits, he would soon get tired of the resulting useless plot. The same is true for this kind of film. <br /> <br /> In other words, "The Order" (and many other similar films before) invent all the stuff about the Catholic Church and the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot of these inventions. Not surprisingly, the plot ends up being inconsistent and stupid. This film has the added appeal of being so interesting to watch while your toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
