Could you tell yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible? It seems a terrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind.) Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off." /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he's a horrible Elvis. It's too low, too weak, too sharp ... well, you've already imagined how bad it would have been. Add to that a black wig and a hat and a heavy-handed mascara and it's a big embarrassing mess. <br /> <br /> The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is decent and since his imitation is so far away, after a while you don't even think about Elvis anymore. You see it as another crazy pop star. Then, at that level, the film becomes watchable. <br /> <br /> Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally chosen as the high queen of beauty, Linda Thompson. But it is attractive in its own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence that is expected of all its roles. There may be too much intelligence in his performance. You must be a kind of drug to attack with a drug that abuses drugs. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new in this story; we've heard it many times before. If you are looking for new information or information, you will not find it. It's told as a love story - one unpaid: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
