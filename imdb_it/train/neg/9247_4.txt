"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. While these movie groups are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts, this seems a little below average. The gag with the double janitor locked and the hard ending that Charlie wakes up from a dream, in which he caresses the hair of the protagonist, just to caress the head of a broom he used as an almost pillow, both classic moments of Chaplin. Both are ironically the beginning and the end. The vehicle is full of fights with the rival keeper and a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the biggest physical object in this film and Charlie uses it for the expert comic effect, whether it's the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter ego who does the things he would like to do but not with his own hands. Interesting things but it gets better.
