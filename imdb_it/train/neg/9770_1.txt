This is the version that even the author hated, because it is so schmaltzy. They gave him a "happy ending" and changed a lot of dialogue, and it's just a big pile of saccharin. The "stage manager" is pretty good, I think he gave birth to the role, but everyone else falls into that style of acting from the 40s that is really just posing. The only great feature: music. This has one of the best scores ever recorded, and it's worth searching for it in a record store. Overall, I think the 1989 Spalding Gray / Eric Stoltz / Penelope Miller version is far superior.
