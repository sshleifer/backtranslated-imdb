waste of my life, .... the director should be embarrassed. because people feel that they need to make movies without value will never make sense to me. when she died in the end, it made me laugh. I had to change channels many times during the movie because I was embarrassed watching such a poor acting. it is hoped that the guy who played Heath never starts working again. Also, I hope the director never makes another film and that his salary is returned for this shit. {0.02 out of 10}
