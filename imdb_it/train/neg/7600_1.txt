This film shows that good acting comes from a good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a good actor, but he's young in this. Donald Sutherland presents himself as an amateur. Why? Since the script is horrible, the adaptation is terrible and the actors seem bored and melancholy. The atmosphere of the film is bad - I could only think when it was over and I turned it off halfway. The director did a very poor job and even though I haven't read the novel, it's certainly a missed opportunity. The atmosphere that this film is trying to evoke and the message and the plot never reach the public. In a word, it is a TERRIBLE film.
