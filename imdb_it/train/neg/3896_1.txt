Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic capsule, commenting that "you didn't live until you saw the sun through Saturn's rings", while the obvious midday sunlight flows through the window when he suddenly has a nose bleed. Then, West came home to a secret hospital, a jelly-like mass that rages and infuriates a large nurse through a fake glass door. Apparently, the West "becomes stronger as it melts", which makes more sense than anything in this unreachable and adrenaline-fueled moovie. Then this "Army Brass", which seems a bit like Coleman Francis (the director of many bad moovies) tries to cover the information, but the goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting. Attacks an old quarrelsome couple because it's melting. He makes a terrible actress scream and complains helplessly for about 10 minutes because he is melting. It's melting because it's melting. Rick Baker's show should be the star here, but they just seem a little tossed. The film is badly filmed and everything seems so dark and confused that it is very difficult to understand what it is - not that it would be of any help. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this ?? : = 8P ps - "Didn't you get any crackers?"
