The performances of Fishbourne (which seems strangely funny in some ways) and (short foreground) by Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery who doesn't seem to make sense in his role and ends up in the motor behavior of an old 80yr. In fact the script doesn't make sense; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix with no argumentative structure with respect to the characters. It is more an accident than a script and can be useful for exam purposes in screen schools. The more you remember the details, the stronger this impression becomes. Capital punishment is not a problem here, although it is a topic from the beginning; it is as if it vanished without further comment. The object and the environment could have been good.
