From the first moment, this "thing" is just a terrible sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the general plot has all the potential for a thriller, the story is told so badly that I can't buy it. From the center of the film, the characters' actions don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> For example, Ed's idea of ​​making Edna make coffee after shooting her son's arm is far below her supposed experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino does not question the fragmented orders he receives from Claremont Williams for a break in the telephone connection that escapes me; shouldn't he be suspicious for a long time that Williams is turning them into? Those FBI agents seem crazy that they come up with a single helicopter to something that they have every reason to consider a capital mafia fight. Furthermore, what they do by holding back and spreading information to Cigliutti is practically an incitement to murder; It seems like a farewell to justice if that's how the FBI investigates. In fact, they would have had a messed up case if they behaved like that. We will see a car accident that normally would have at least seriously damaged if not killed most of the passengers, but miraculously leaves them all with a few bruises. On the contrary, the incident is immediately followed by Domino making love with Choco, who is from Domino's point of view in no way founded by previous events, but only by being drugged for the eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes starting from the call of Claremont Williams appears to me equally dramatic and dazzling. This combined with the tremendous, restless work of the camera only makes a piece hesitant to call a movie. I'm sorry for the useless effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of the question.
