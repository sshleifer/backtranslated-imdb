I've seen some pretty bad movies, and that's right there. No plot to talk about, it's like one of those episodes of bad coma in a soap opera. I just wanted to hit that little girl because, well, let's just say that she's really suspicious throughout the movie. The monsters that ran wearing a bling were fun. I also saw a bit of "Silent Hill" in there. And I read that this was done by, and I watched a Finnish metal band, Lordi. So it's no wonder that it doesn't make much sense. It seems to be a vehicle to promote the band and nothing else. The special effects are very good, the appearance of the film, the monsters and even the acting are good. But the story and the story are not there.
