I'm trying to create a word game "Holmes with Doors", but I can't put it together. WONDERLAND, suitably dirty and overcrowded, offers Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time ... but how shy this film is on the famous 14 inches! The Australian criminal films always flash and skip graphic violence, instead ... as someone famous once said about the double standard of American cinema: "kisses a breast and is an X, stab and a PG 13 action" .. Also the WONDERLAND is 14 minutes long, and at the end the bad spiral we were all happy to escape from the cinema. How many movies called WONDERLAND will we have? There must be six in the last decade. Pixelated violence and muted color create the bleak tone but the swinging cam becomes dull, as if we were staring at their nostrils all the time. Taking some ideas form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER everything becomes forgettable the next day.
