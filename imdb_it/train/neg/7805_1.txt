An actor's first film is usually something that one can afford to lose: it is often the first work in which the lack of cinematic experience by all concerned is really on display, and this film is no exception. <br /> <br /> But worse than that, even by 1982 standards, it's so ugly, it's hysterically fun. Shot entirely in the Chicago area with a obviously reduced budget, most of the acting of the entire cast is stiff, wooden and comics - a cross between a school play and a bad community theater. The noise coming from the nearby traffic often suffocates the dialogue, and the dialogue is really bad, very declarative in a way that looks like forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. The scenes are elaborated and moved, and even if the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age. <br /> <br /> I believe it is possible to make a Christian film that is appealing to a large lay public, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on "The Message" or, in this case, their links autobiographical with the project that good cinematographic production values ​​are put aside. (I'm sure it's not a coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer / director / editor - and cast member.) <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Michael Madsen was much more interesting - and credible - to watch in his later films. Careers like yours are certainly not built on films like this.
