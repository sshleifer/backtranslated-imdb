At least with the teen geek gets the girl movies, the guy is usually unpopular with the girls. In the 40-year-old virgin she is replaced by a 40-year-old boy who is popular among women, but somehow remained a virgin. But then should you not involve your brain with this film or did I miss the fact that it was in a coma for 20 years? <br /> <br /> One of a series of films in which 40 people act like teenagers and women for some reason find this a sufficiently attractive quality that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it difficult to understand how a country that has produced such excellent television comedies seems to think it has to rely on rough and superficial characters for laughter. They made the gross films. They acted like all Americans have a mental age of 15. Where will they go next? <br /> <br /> This film is coarse and raw entertainment with nothing to recommend.
