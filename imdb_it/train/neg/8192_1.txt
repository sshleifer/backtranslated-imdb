Well, I have to say that this movie was so bad that I would have gone out if I hadn't had to see it for work. And the worst part is that I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city, paid $ 10 parking spaces twice because newspaper ads were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I saw him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. However, the plot has potential: it looked great in the preview, but it is full of absolutely ridiculous, predictable and weak plot turning points. And I was hoping this would be a Christmas movie where DIDN Christmas "had to be saved, and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn, but no. The only interesting part was sleigh rides, and the little baby bladck was the best character I'm sure this movie would be great for kids, but for adults it's so lousy that it's a duty to sit down.
