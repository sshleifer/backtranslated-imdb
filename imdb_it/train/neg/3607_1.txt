I'm starting this review with a big giant spoiler on this movie. Don't read further ... here it comes, avoid your eyes! The main heroine, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is killed here. There, I just saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of those inexpensive films that were put together in the middle of the 1980s era. Despite the killing of heroin, this is just a shoddy stuff. <br /> <br /> Both priests and university students have a nasty shock here. They are portrayed as subversive idiots and sociopaths who have too many internal problems to deal with what appears to be the life of the university campus ... and university students come out even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just a gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest you look at your head cleaning tape, which would be more fun. <br /> <br /> This is classified (R) for strong physical violence, gore, vulgarity, very short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
