You will notice that the chemist, who appears in two scenes and gets to speak, is played by Stephen King. "Don't give up your daily work" is the standard thing to say, but it's not fair. King recovers quite well: it's no worse than any other cast member, and better than others. History, on the other hand, is pure garbage. Please give up your day job. <br /> <br /> I've never seen so many horrible performances - of which the main actor (THE LEAD ACTOR'S!) is probably the worst - brought together in the only movie. Everyone acts in a friendly way, but not in a fun way; everyone somehow manages to overcome the limit without spending or manifesting energy. I blame writer / director Tom Holland. It can't be that ALL the actors are REALLY that bad. What are the odds against this? I have to admit that I've never heard of it before, but anyway, I don't think I could go into a talent agency and go out with this bad actor if I tried to do it: AN actor, despite my best efforts, would turn out to have talent So What's more likely - that Tom Holland did a dozen consecutive snake eyes, or wrote a horrible script and then directed it badly? This would also explain why the actors are bad in direct proportion to their importance in the script. The more direction an actor has, the worse he has performed. ("You want me to bend like a hunchback, talk from the back of my throat, show all my teeth, and look bored at the same time? Okay ...") <br /> <br /> the theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to write a disgusting script. Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a nice character, but this is a misleading way to put it. He is not a knowable character. Everything we find out about him before supernatural things start to happen is that he is fat and that all he can think of is food. ("All I can think of is food," he says, with availability.) And finally ... <br /> <br /> (Sigh) I suppose I should put a warning on the spoiler here ... <br /> <br /> Eventually it becomes bad. Why? I can only shrug my shoulders. Maybe it's under a kind of spell. Yes, it probably is. By "evil" I mean perhaps "inexplicable" - it is not as bad as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means - the psychology of the end. However, his actions do not make sense in the end, nobody's actions make a lot of sense, and this despite the fact that the characters do little, but explain their motivations for the benefit of the public. <br /> <br /> By the way, here is my best friend / line delivery candidate: "I don't think you'd like ... IN REALITY ..." [big dramatic break] "... I don't think that you would like it at all. "
