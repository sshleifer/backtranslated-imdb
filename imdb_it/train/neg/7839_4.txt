Serge Farnel made a very precise criticism of this film in the magazine "The Rwandese night" (www.lanuitrwandaise.net) <br /> <br /> A critique that shows how France was behind the whole situation suffered by the United Nations in Rwanda. <br /> <br /> The UN soldiers were in a dangerous situation while the French soldiers were warmly welcomed by the genocide forces. <br /> <br /> The day before, ten UN soldiers had been killed by genocide forces. <br /> <br /> That's why the UN soldiers decided to protect their lives by driving behind French trucks. <br /> <br /> By doing so, they have renounced the Tutsi which is inexcusable of course. <br /> <br /> But we must remember that the French soldiers organized this situation.
