just below the surface lies what? a simply horrible film is the one. <br /> <br /> as other commentators have rightly commented, the storm sequences are simply ridiculous. to cut the wood already soaked in the pouring rain? is it now smart threat? presentiment? sexual tension? for those who read boring and artificial, boring and artificial, boring and excessively contrived. <br /> <br /> I want to say thank god for my sara's shower scene, but in retrospect I think the film's producers, having seen the disaster complete, realized they had to put something to make it halfway helpful. therefore it becomes just another expedient. do yourself a favor and give yourself a shot.
