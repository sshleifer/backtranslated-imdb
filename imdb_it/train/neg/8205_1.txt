Bad acting and a very superficial story. Not even a decent B-Movie <br /> <br /> The events that turned out to be shocking like the humans that board an alien ship were boring and very crippled. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst science fiction I've ever seen. I saw the stars 5.0 and I decided to see it since I like the genre, but it made me sick. <br /> <br /> Now there are very few good films on ALIEN subject, I think because most of them are low budget <br /> <br /> I give them 3/10
