I just spent four dollars to rent this movie! Because Alliance Atlantis promotes such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me. But even more surprising were the reasonably good reviews that a couple of critics from the Canadian newspaper gave to this film. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and has a low budget. It is as if they expected Canadian films to be bad, so they give a good review regardless. <br /> <br /> Now on the film: The acting was below average (with the exception of the male protagonist, who was actually quite good). The quality of the film was poor, and I imagine we can expect an extremely low budget. The script was absolutely hideous. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the main characters, a drug dealer who flirts with one of his customers so that he can recruit him to repair and steal bicycles for his band, whose sole purpose is to destroy SUVs at random. Presumably many of the gang members' bicycles have been destroyed in these activities (I don't know how she can't afford to buy only new ones, since she should be this big drug connection from Vancouver to Toronto). /> <br /> However, the point of the story (which is not revealed until the middle of the film) is that the drug dealer plans to bomb the buildings in the Toronto area to try to make the houses more accessible - as no one would like to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - I have to say more. <br /> <br /> Too bad for the Toronto Film Festival for having accepted such a film, Telefilm for supporting it and Globe and Mail and Georgia Heterogeneous newspapers to give such distorted judgments. <br /> <br /> A film should not receive special treatment just because it is Canadian !!!!
