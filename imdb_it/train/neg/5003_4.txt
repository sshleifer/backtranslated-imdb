I'm embarrassed to write this review. I say this because those of you who read will know that I have sat through everything and that it is embarrassing to admit even to strangers. But I just had to warn those who read the viewers' comments on IMDb before watching a movie to not watch this. It's the least I can do. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The plot is silly. Acting is amateur. And the direction, the work with the camera, the sets, the costumes, etc. They are all second choice. Let it go.
