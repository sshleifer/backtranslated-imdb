Look, I loved the movie PROPER Anchorman, but this was really bad. The kind of evil that makes you want to be able to recover that time in your life, the kind of evil that makes you think "what the hell were they thinking of filming this in the first place", the kind of evil that makes you wish you had employed another 50 minutes when you enter the kitchen to have a snack during the movie, the kind of evil that makes leprosy look funny, the kind of evil that makes you think you want to rent a Pauly Shore movie instead ... seriously, I can't explain how bad it was. <br /> <br /> That being said .... there were some semi-funny laughs, but they are all a lot less fun than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it fun and funny, but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was left out for a good reason ... it wasn't even that good. <br /> <br /> Do yourself (or the US, a favor) a favor, and don't watch this DVD ... it will muddy the good movie that is Anchorman and you don't want to do it. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm fine now.
