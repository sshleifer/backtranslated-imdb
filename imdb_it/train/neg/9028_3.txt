I have just seen this movie and I must say that with such a big premise and a great talent this turkey is right there !!! A friend lent me this film and I looked at it with an open mind mainly because he had such great praise for history. <br /> <br /> Well, the film started with Kevin Costner as a retired fighter pilot ... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He had to be hired by the character of Anthony Quinn to be his new pilot ... well, we will never see Costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a great Mexican businessman and Costner cuts for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is near death and Costner pushes him to the meeting, which happens with a partner of Quinn! But nothing comes out of it ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have the character of Gammon? Why did they sell horses with partner Quinn if there was nothing to do? <br /> <br /> Also, after leaving Costner dead, they turned the character of Madeline Stowe into a whore, then attacked one of Quinn's men who was paying for a shift ... she stabbed him with her same knife, and the next thing that was transferred to a convent! No explanation as to why it was moved, or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much wasted talent for such a weak script and bad editing !! I only saw it because a friend owned it and made me look at it ... I'll give it to him for the 2 hours I've lost in my life watching the destroyed thing!
