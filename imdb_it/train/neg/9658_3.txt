My God, what an incredible movie! It reminded me so much of the similar scene in Mel Gibson's "We were Soldiers" when "the Company is not lost, they are just cut" And the other scene in Pearl Harbor when the British officer tells Ben Affleck "If all Americans are like you, so God helps the nation that goes to war with America! <br /> <br /> Put all 3 movies together and you'll have enough BULLSHIT to fertilize the entire Sahara desert. <Br /> <br /> The history of the truncated battalion could be quite real but the film could have done without that preaching related American jingoist propaganda. There were no audible noises at the cinema during the scene mentioned above at Pearl Harbor ( no joke) The Lost Battalion is still in a class of its own. <br /> <br /> "Do Americans think they are unbeatable ?? "Actually I collapsed and damn close to vomiting for all the burn that was vomited during this diarrheal disaster (the film that is) <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were well done (3 stars for this) but if the script is manure, then wrapped also in brightly colored ribbons, it is still manure. The writer, James Carabatsos, also wrote those other screamers ?? Hamburger Hill, No Mercy, Heartbreak Ridge.Someone, please shoot them first who writes another kind of garbage. <br /> <br /> The director, Russell Mulcahy is also an Australian: God, shame !!!
