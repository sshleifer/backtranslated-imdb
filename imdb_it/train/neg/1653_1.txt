It seems strange that someone has read this script and thought, "This is funny! I mean, it's so funny it has to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she the person really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, much more than the director / writer? <br /> <br /> This movie sucks in every way possible. There is no shred of good dialogue and not a nice character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer the second worst film ever, "No Hold's Barred" by Hulk Hogan, at this point quite considerably. It almost seems like Shakespearen in comparison. <br /> <br /> The finale is completed with several minutes of outtakes, and is still under 80 minutes. The outtakes include cast members who laugh at the "hilarious" mistakes they made and things that went wrong on the set of this "comedy". I'm glad to see someone laughing somehow, with some connection to this 'movie'. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film is fun. Anything. Continue and continue. He is really so lame. I love movies that are so bad that they are good. This is so ugly that it is ... something, but I don't know what, and I hope I'll never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet doesn't suck a priori, and it's actually the only good thing about this hit movie. But this means very little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
