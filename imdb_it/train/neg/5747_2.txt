I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur productions. And Meat Market 2 really starts promising with a nice tribute to Fulci's classic "Zombi". <br /> <br /> So I relaxed and waited to be hit. Ok, some of the tricks are fantastic for such a cheap movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but there's nothing. <br /> <br /> I did not expect a new Qui Romero but there is no sequence in the whole film that even has a bit of suspense or shock. The director knows how to stage interesting body ripples and eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn something more. <br /> <br /> In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with boredom - that's not enough for me - I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> ** on *****
