"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak film. Mira Sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows at people. Mira has an Italian accent that shakes from time to time. Couldn't he speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican accent that distracts. The dialogue is bad and the delivery is of wood. Cinematography looks nice, but it's not enough to save this tripe. THIS NEXT PART OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> During the climax it seems that the villain leaves, but then goes back down the stairs to get shot and make a nice acrobatics along the railing. This shows that this script has no originality whatsoever. TO AVOID!
