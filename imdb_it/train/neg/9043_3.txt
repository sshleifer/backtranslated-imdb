I went to see this with my wife and 3 year old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a hard time paying attention. The film looks fantastic but the story becomes so strange and lengthy that I hoped my son would fall asleep so he could get it and go out. <br /> <br /> Do not say that the film is not an interesting concept, it is just said strangely, (bad screenplay?) especially when we "meet the family" for the first time. I know we should have the impression that the family is extravagant but good God, they could have shortened that sequence by a good 15 minutes (apparently, I didn't actually do it in time). At that point I was scratching my head for an exit.
