I'm not a normal Springer spectator, but I watch his show at the top of his lungs and I think the show is a nice guilty pleasure and a good way to kill some time. So, of course, I'll watch this movie waiting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears in about twenty minutes of the movie's running time. The other hour and twenty minutes have gone on to build this pseudo-farce on trailer stuff, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks as sexy as HELLLL) is a charlatan slut sleeping with her stepfather (a deadly, odd-looking Michael Dudikoff, a chain smoker, who finally moves away from his action hero character) Mom discovers the deal, they fight, they want to take him to the show "Jerry" (it's true, no Springer). And then we have a parallel story with an African American couple. They take him to the "Jerry" show. The characters collide. Blah, blah, weird! Trash was rarely this BORRRINGG !!!! I was wondering why the hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked his movie. Well, now it is TOTALLY obvious !! Whether you love it or hate it, you would hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess of a movie (if that's what you call it). It has been modified so badly, with scenes that do not connect and, after a period of time, the plot virtually disappears and is simply on the whole map! Just imagine a predictable soap opera turned into a comic farce. With rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. It's as risky as it gets. Don't get me wrong, the scene is rather risky, but if you watch the overall film comparing it with Springer program material - this disastrous farce seems extremely sterilized. <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (out of 10)
