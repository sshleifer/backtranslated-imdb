Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to "fill" the background. Sometimes it works well, the scene in which Grace and her witness watch from a distance the execution of the King is particularly surprising. At other times it gives the film a strangely amateur appearance, similar to a home video. However, the main failure is that the mere artificiality of the staging creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we are looking at is not real, so how can we try the characters? To be honest, I didn't care at all about what happened to the Lady or Duke. <br /> <br /> The other serious failure, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the lead role. It is virtually in every scene and the success or otherwise of the film is based on its interpretation. OK, he's speaking a foreign language but he's unable to express a real emotion. His emulation in the scene in which he tells his friend Madame de Meyler (an excellent performance of novice Helena Dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some laughter in the audience. Also, look at his hands when he expresses emotions! <br /> <br /> All in all a very disappointing film, especially given the positive reviews on this site.
