"Unhinged" is a strange little film, a forgotten slasher of the golden age of the genre. It is difficult to write a satisfactory review of this film simply because the film is so unique. The plot is quite exaggerated: three young women who go to a rock concert go into a car accident and end up landing in the villa of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize that something is not right when they hear strange breaths and noises from the attic. In addition, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, while they quarrel intensely in front of their dinner guests. The old mother even goes so far as to call her daughter a whore and a slut and accuses her of sneaking in kids at night to sleep with them. In the middle of the film, when a girl finally decides that it is better to leave to seek help, the killing begins. <br /> <br /> As for acting, this film is in the lower part of the barrel. NONE of the three girls in difficulty can act, in particular the girl "guide". It's almost unbelievable to hear them express their lines in the same tone of wood throughout the film. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The film is also quite boring in parts and really, really drags on. The killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before. However, as mentioned here, the film earns points with a brilliant and disturbing ending. Comes totally from the left field and has the same shock value as the classic "Sleepaway Camp" field ending. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is boring and suffers from a hideous and boring and boring acting. The secluded and disquieting villa and the dark and disturbing lighting give the film a grainy realism, but this is quickly destroyed when one of the characters tries to act. It could be worth it if you can hold on until the end, but I tell you that you are better off just by forwarding fast in the last 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
