Paint by number of stories and mediocre acting saved by an authentic color - and some really wonderful and deeply felt moments. It effectively captures the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and addresses the cultural conflict of the main family experiences in a very sensitive and inventive way. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this germ of a good film is imprisoned in a person with no purpose and extremely twisted plot who manages to incorporate religious conflicts, a conflict over a road construction project, the sexual life of secondary characters and even tertiaries, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a group of racist thugs, at least three different carnivals, the complexities of local ecclesiastical politics, and again and again. And all this does not even include the actual central plot, which concerns only the hopes, dreams and frustrations of two girls (and all their families) at the turning point in their lives. I was shocked when I realized that the whole thing had to take place during a summer (and that so much film was made in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Ultimately the film is melodramatic, every plot the point is predictable, important events occur that alter life and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later ... and some of these events are extremely unpleasant. The most surprising fact is that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a completely predictable "crackdown") and then he is completely forgiven and from that moment on the whole incident was forgotten. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced only to die a couple of minutes later and provide another "breakthrough". It's all completely mechanical, until the end that ties all the free sides in an orderly way (well, not all of them, only the ones that the movie thinks you're interested in).
