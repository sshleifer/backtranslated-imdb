Generally oversized films that boast a strong cast and intelligent dialogue and, of course, the songs of Dean Martin. The problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between him and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost compensates for this with her reactions to Cage's changing accent and out-of-control body language. Cage simply never takes up his role. Try everything you can think of and run into an actor rather than a real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had the same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more than one Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage continues to play these roles, perhaps because he likes this kind of film, but his own energy as an actor does not lend itself to them, even if he has improved with repeated attempts. He should leave this type of role to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in off-beat roles and movies, where he can be his crazy and interesting self.
