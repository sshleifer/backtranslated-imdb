I am a Christian ... and I feel that this film is horrible. <br /> <br /> Nobody, apart from the tough, Christian Christians of the Bible, will adore this film. The message is too much in the face. If you want to touch a wider audience, you have to be much thinner. You cannot have the bible daddy and take him with you in EVERY scene. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Bad direction. The revelation of missing persons should have been terrifying, but it was ridiculous. Do they leave their clothes on the floor? It reminded me of the old Ed Wood movies: "Oh my God! People are missing!" That scene in the plane is simply stupid. Think about it: if you found your relative's clothes near you, you won't scream "oh my God. They disappeared! And start crying and screaming. First you would be denied ... you wouldn't want to jump to that conclusion. Look at Jodie Foster in FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite shot is the dog sitting on the lawn with a pile of clothes and boots sitting next to him. As for me from the couch I was laughing so hard. <br /> <br /> The music was so bad so distracted. It was as if the composer was in his own world making his own films. "Here is my chance to make a thriller", "here's my chance to take action!" Stop telling me how you feel JAMES COVELL! A good score supports what is happening on the screen ... this film needed more than a UNDER score, but instead it was as much in the face as the message was. <br /> <br /> The writing was bland, so was the captain Christian Kirk Cameron: Chelsea was the worst: "n on you understand! People are missing! ". Brad Johnson was ridiculous. The two prominent performances came from the Anti-Christ and the older boy (sorry, I don't remember their names) Looking at the" making of "(to answer my question on "what were they thinking ??", the producers, directors and actors are simply deluding themselves ... saying "we will reach a large audience" and "Brad Johnson is incredible" and "this is just like a Hollywood movie". I have come to the conclusion that they simply do not know what the heck they are doing. <br /> <br /> I congratulate the effort. Bringing the message to a large audience is a fantastic idea. Watch films like WIDE AWAKE, SIGNS, CONTACTS, CHRIST'S PASSION, ALSO O'BROTHER, WHERE YOU ART? The bottom line is that the film had to be made by people who have talent and vision. Unfortunately, it wasn't.
