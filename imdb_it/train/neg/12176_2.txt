The original Trancers is not at all a great film. It had huge holes in the plot and very little in terms of internal logic. However, it was fun, done better than most low budget B movies, and could be surprisingly witty. Unfortunately, Trancers II is none of these. <br /> <br /> Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems as most flop sequels. The plot is thin enough to see and the writing is insipid. It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie would be enough and wouldn't worry about anything else. Not even level B veteran actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs have been able to drag this film out of the muck. <br /> <br /> A brief overview of the plot: Jack Deth (Thomerson) is a cop of the future who was sent in 1985 to save the ancestors of his government members. The Trancers II are held six years after the events of the first Trancers. Jack Deth is married to Lena (Helen Hunt), the woman he met in the first movie, and they both live with Hap Ashby, the man Deth was sent to protect in the past. It turned out that Whistler's brother (the villain of the first film) traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers, people turned into brainless zombies to kill Ashby. Complicating Jack's mission is the fact that his first wife, long dead before Jack travels in the past, has been sent back to stop Whistler's brother, and now Jack finds himself working with her. <br /> <br /> two real problems with this film. One is that the method of creating Trancers in this film is radically different from the methods used in the first film. What makes it annoying is that, in a rather poor example of Soviet revisionism, they behave as if it were always the technique. <br /> <br /> The other thing that bothers me is the love triangle between Deth, Lena and Alice Stilwell (Jack's first wife) gets very little time on screen. This particularly bothered me because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the film. It seemed like it was just something that was thrown in to fill the space in the film. The character of Alice in particular seems very sorry that she is only reunited with her husband to find that he has remarried, making her very superficial or badly written. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think of to watch this film is if you're interested in watching the entire Trancers series (currently for a total of six films). Otherwise, even if you're a fan of the original Trancers, stay away from this lukewarm sequel.
