I will keep this fast and sweet Five girls returning home from a football game decide to take a "shortcut" that leads them along a deserted and wooded road. Obviously nothing good happens to them, and they arrive safely at their destination. <br /> <br /> Okay, they don't. Soon they are hunted by a deranged girl who has some serious mental problems, and what follows is 90 minutes of pure boredom. <br /> <br /> I hope to never see any of these actors in any film again. Their screaming and shrill voices gave me a headache and the script was so badly written that it included many repeated phrases and senseless hysterical screams. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror movies I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
