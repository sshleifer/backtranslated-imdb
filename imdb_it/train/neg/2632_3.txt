It saddens me to judge a film with many of my favorite actors, places and genres, such as Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and the political thriller, but "The Sentinel" is really low. It is as if they had a great idea in advance, they signed the right cast and made some great shots in the city and then took a vacation letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame another umpteenth performance by Basinger (not only do I feel she's one of Hollywood's worst actors, but I'm still smoking more than a decade after she was the only one, and certainly the only bad actor) in the film, winning an acting Oscar for "LA Confidential".) But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, whom I adore as Jack Bauer on "24", once again plays Jack. I miss his old days "A Time to Kill" or "A Few Good Men". Douglas certainly took a break from acting and called this. Plot: Someone, a traitor to the Secret Service, wants the dead president and Douglas is (haphazardly) framed. Will anyone believe him? In reality, there is no spoiler here: as soon as they found that subframe in half, it's over before you know it. And why does someone (s) want the president dead? Is it to be revealed in the sequel? Too many holes in the plot, too many doors open and never closed and 'The Sentinel' too predictable. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone familiar with these types of movies or having just seen an episode of "Law & Order" will know in the first few frames. It was terrible? Not really, the photograph was good, and although Sutherland recited to Jack again, he still understood.
