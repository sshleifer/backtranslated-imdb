I saw him at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my best judgment, I liked it, but it seemed to me that the acting was a little ... weak (above all I noticed it from the family of the teenage boy). I mean, the script wasn't stellar at all, but the actors didn't make me believe relationships. <br /> <br /> The plot is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethelss, I liked it. The characters are nice and the plot is not challenging or upsetting. It's sweet, the characters care about each other, and I don't consider it as fifty minutes badly spent. <br /> <br /> But I don't recommend it.
