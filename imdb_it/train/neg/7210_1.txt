Once again, Disney manages to make a film for children that totally ignores its background. About the only common thing with this and the original gadget cartoons are the names. The most glaring mistakes are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a luxury item, Dr Claw is more of a show-off than a bad villain, etc., but there are more. The horrors start from the first minutes of the film: having Gadget as a security guard called John Brown does not help to identify him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right at the beginning we see Disney's brazen attempt to transform every story into a love story between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, which only serves to make this movie compatible with Disney. Add to that the fact that the "Claws" seen in this movie and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally and you will see that this will not be close to the original plot at all. What would help would be a better plot to replace it, but as you guessed, Disney couldn't do it either. The whole movie is just Gadget that acts foolishly out of stupidity and craves after Brenda. As if insult to injury was added, Disney introduced the "new" Gadgetmobile - it doesn't look like it, it works or thinks like the old Gadgetmobile, it's just the canonical figure of "comic relief". Disney has obviously acknowledged that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy, but they pulled out all the smart racing gags (like the job card that explodes in the face of the Chief) and replaced them with Gadget as a moron, the Gadgetmobile is a wise donkey and "Claw" showcases. Someone should tell Disney that "film for children" does not imply "total lack of brain use". The gadget should be intended for children aged 10-12 ... not for children aged 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this film should be, it is NOT, I repeat, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate it.
