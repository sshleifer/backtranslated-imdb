I'll put it here, this is the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released what I call one of its greatest films of all time. Now take away the great songs, add a poor storyline that looks like a lost TV show. "Put together and what do you get?" the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After seeing this, I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should have ended up with "and lived happily ever after". not this junk. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like "a turning point in time" that was moderate but better than this. Also, what do we care about Anastasia? He changed position as Iago did, but he didn't help anyone.
