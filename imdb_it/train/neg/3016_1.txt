Like many, I'm a fan of Tony Scott's movies. When this film came out, I had high hopes that it would be like "Man on Fire". To find out that the film is the furthest thing from it! The story was trampling the water from the beginning, and choosing Mickey Rourke wasn't such a good idea. And the whole "arm'scene" was too free! <br /> <br /> The film focuses on Kiera Kinghtly and this film reveals that it will never become a movie star! The film brought some of the worst acting ever. <br /> <br /> I like the direction of Tony Scott, but this is all the cake! Sorry Ton, 1 out of 10!
