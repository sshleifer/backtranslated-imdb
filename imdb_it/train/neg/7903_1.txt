I think I saw this movie, but didn't mention it, since I fell asleep during the vision because it didn't exactly "catch my excitement and my imagination". At least I know I've seen enough to know that I won't see him again soon. Or ever. <br /> <br /> Good, talk about lame ... Really lame. Totally lame. A six-year-old would not like it either. Basically it didn't have any dramatic impact. Zilch. Nada. Only the shlock has turned into dreck. Comedy? Was it supposed to be a comedy? Ya coulda tricked me-ee-ee ...! <br /> <br /> Now, if the aliens had been insatiably carnivorous like in the movie "Critters", we could have made the human characters do something a little deeper than being overly complacent ... and screaming and running around their lives so they don't get eaten so the story could be something more exciting than looking at the dried paint. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about watching this. It's not worth it. You can find something more interesting to do. How to look at dry paint. Or fall asleep.
