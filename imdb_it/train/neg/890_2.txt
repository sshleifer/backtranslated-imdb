I saw this stack of vignettes regurgitated tonight in a preview showing and I was immediately struck by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First of all, the film has practically flaunted its dark points. Are there no black New Yorkers or gay lovers? Or who, for example, knows self-sufficient whites in love? I know that Crash love is not an anvil inclusiveness, but you can't expect to have a cinematographic New York without these widespread members of society. Also, you know that the people who produced this ish thought that Crash deserved that Oscar-winner, so where's everyone? <br /> <br /> Perhaps worse than the bizarre and stubborn socioeconomic ignorance were the just and offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted by beautiful women in wheelchairs? This film was about being the worst: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction - which embraces all possible genres of the whites who smoke cigarettes outside luxury restaurants forever. <br /> <br /> But thank God they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson together for that Jumper meeting. And, side note, Uma dodged a bullet, Ethan Hawke looked devastated, this is obviously a matter of appearance, but added an extraordinarily disturbing extra vibe to his terrifying script in front of the poor and adorable Maggie Q. <br /> <br /> I had a terrible moment to choose mine the least favorite scene for the questionnaire on the end of the film, but it must be the piece Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby for the sheer lack of taste, which saddens me because I really like those two actors. I don't consider myself easily offended, but all I could do was laugh and look around in disgust like someone's 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> A very close second place in this incredibly tight race of terrible things is the dull tone of Shia LaBeouf who plays what it means for a former Disney Channel star acting against Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against. Against is the only explanation. I realize now that the initial sequence with Orlando Bloom is a relative climax. HIGHLIGHT. Keep that in mind when your brain starts to leak out right after the headlines, which seem to be a nod to New York's first Real World. This film is embarrassing, strangely dated, inarticulate, ineffective, pretentious and, ultimately, completely separated from any real New York idea. <br /> <br /> (The extra star is for the sequence Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach, as it is rather sweet, but it is just a bright spot in what seem like hours of useless masturbatory torment).
