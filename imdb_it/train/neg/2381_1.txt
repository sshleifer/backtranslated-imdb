I'm not surprised that even cowgirls get blues if this movie is something to pass by. I was expecting something better from Uma Thurman, which was the reason I suffered for the first time in this experience. A terrible film with only music as a saving quality. It is a pity that we are unable to give 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This film deserves it.
