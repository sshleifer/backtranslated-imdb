This is one of those films that is more interesting to look at from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I do my assessments based on how much I enjoyed or was entertained by the film, so I give it a 4. If I were to classify it as an academic film, however, it would get a 10. <br /> <br /> It is filmed in a very interesting, like a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effect and reality. It aims to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind, and is interesting in these respects. <br /> <br /> However, the film has a lot of disgusting elements that I didn't find very funny. They are just disturbing. It also has some very interesting images and some interesting concepts, but some of the relationships between the characters (especially between mother and child) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> In this film you will like it or it will not. For me it was interesting from an academic point of view, but it wasn't a good watch, and I probably won't come back to it a second time. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you are looking for fun. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
