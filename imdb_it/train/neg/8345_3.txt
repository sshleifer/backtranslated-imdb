This film could have been much better, especially considering the talent. The portrait of Frankie Lymon by Larenz Tate was not good, especially in musical representations. He doesn't synchronize well with his lips and his scenic mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrait of women as a group of gold diggers has written all about Hollywood. The powers obviously pushed him, but he made the characters more unrealistic. The positive aspects of the film were the portrait of Little Richard by Miguel Nunez and the cameo of Little Richard in person. Lela Rochon is a real eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. Too bad the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox have been wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a missed opportunity.
