This is one of those movies that makes you want the time you spent looking back, and then some, like the time you spent collecting it accidentally, the time you spent getting to the video store, etc. <br /> <br /> First of all, the look: it's grainy, it's low budget. Now this in itself is not a bad movie. But the way it was filmed makes the action unnatural, so it's a kind of distraction. <br /> <br /> So, the story. 3 girls go on vacation for a weekend with boys. Obviously, like ALL when you go camping, they stop on the road to pick up the earrings. When they arrive in the area where they will stay, they are dragged by Mr. Ranger Sir, who scolds them for throwing a lit cigarette out of the car during the fire season, and then pushing them where they go (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 "nice guys" wander around, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately hit, but apparently Bambi is struck by anything with two legs. Mady is rather disappointed with this development because she couldn't wait to spend a weekend forgetting about her ex finding herself sh ** - in front and stoned with her friends gal. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot, there is an old hermit who lives that way, perhaps someone with whom he doesn't intertwine, and the area and the cabin in which they are located have a sort of " reputation". <br /> <br /> So, of course, sooner or later (unfortunately much later) some of our wooden weekend visitors start dying and find various booby traps (although a couple of them actually hit a little more below) and, of course, the remaining campers are understandably upset. Of course there is no cell phone reception (who would lose the ability to control their mobile phone to receive reception in a movie?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps popping up in strange moments and his behavior seems a little strange, but he said he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic twist to this that you will not want to lose too much if you are still awake. We pray that you wake up on an empty screen. <br /> <br /> The acting in this is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, and the whole enterprise is simply lame and I find it surprising that this has even been published. Avoid at all costs, 1 in 10.
