The only reason I'm bothering to comment on this film is to save you all the 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. <br /> <br /> I bought it ex-rental for Â£ 3.00, it looked interesting, so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> In a few minutes after turning it on, I realized that I had made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored away until the winter and then thrown on the nearest wood fire, where they may encounter others of their kind. <br /> <br /> As for Devin Hamilton (writer and director), it should only be filmed, unfortunately this should have been done before he made this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, if you see it in stores run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
