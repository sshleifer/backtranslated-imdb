Germans think that grinning is fun (just as Americans think that mumbling is sexy and that women with an English accent play). I had to cross my eyes every time the screen filled up again with a giant close-up of a smug face. One of those "home hack on the corporate mainframe" tells where it cheats a bank by tapping some random keys on its home PC that is only connected to a power outlet. The director obviously loves the great protagonist. I can't say I share his feelings. There is quite a bit of comedy when the whole family sits in front of the television singing in a neutral way along with the advertisements. Apparently this review has to be a longer line so here it is.
