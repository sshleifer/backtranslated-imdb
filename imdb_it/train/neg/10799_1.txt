This film is so, so, so horrible, that angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossover attempts, like his work in Shaq-Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums, and later, the epic service of a horrible film making that is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is no single good thing to say about this movie. I've seen it a lot of times when I was very young, but I must have been an idiot then, because this movie takes everything that's funny about movies and tears aside. It's fun to tease. I saw it on the Disney Channel some time ago and spent a few minutes doing it. Even if, once the thrill of mocking is over, you are still overwhelmed by his agility. <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV, try this: consider while watching the movie, removing from it all scenes where Shaq uses his magical powers of genius. If you do, it becomes like a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and beating to seduce him. It's pretty funny and scary. <br /> <br /> A horrible movie example. Don't do it, if you don't want to laugh at it, watch this movie.
