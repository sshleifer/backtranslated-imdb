Really a bad shot on the video "film" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video producers. <br /> <br /> If you intend to make a bad horror movie at least throw blood, blood and nudity. There is blood provided by metal objects cut in latex bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and prostitutes but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talk. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are no editing effects: fades, wipes, etc. From time to time a little black seems to separate the scenes. > <br /> Terrible heavy metal band music whose site occupies most of the credits. Werewolves are represented by rubber masks attached only to the faces of the "actors". They didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee that a 10-year-old child with a video camera can put together a better film. No reason to buy, rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.
