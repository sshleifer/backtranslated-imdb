This movie is really horrible. After seeing the ad, I thought it might have its charm ... but it's not. Girls can't act and can't even sing. The soundtrack of this film is full of their songs, and it's not a pretty sight, terrible storyline, incredible storyline, it's one of FAR's worst Disney movies! Ally is not a bad actress on "Phil of the Future", so I don't know what happened in "Cow Belles". And his sister, AJ, just seems to take a ride on her "little sister" fame, and shows no talent as ever. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film the girls finally learn some moral cliches, but this is too late to save this film on the wreck. <br /> <br /> Terrible
