This rip off of the 1984 movie "Gremlins" is probably the biggest train accident of a film ever made. Even for a "B" level film, all the other cheap horror films on the same platform completely dwarf this film in terms of plot, acting and goodness. <br /> <br /> Start with an old casual security guard and a young punk security guard whose name doesn't matter. Why? Because a few minutes into the film he enters the "forbidden" safe, and is killed while living his fantasy of being a rockstar in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is just a starter for the first course scat The main character, KEVIN, fights several times to prove himself more than a total pussy. Maybe he succeeds in the film, but for the public he proves to be nothing but a bad actor. Kevin finds a job with the old security guard, and is guided through his security shift to the (waiting for it) abandoned lot in the studio. Yes, why bother creating a set when you can simply use the studio itself. Return to the film. Kevin somehow opens the forbidden safe and releases the Hobgoblin. Hobgoblins force people to live their wildest fantasies and then kill them for some reason. Must be returned before dawn or otherwise ... or else? Exactly. <br /> <br /> Other characters include the friend of the "macho" army of Kevin NICK, the "woman" of Nick DAPHNE whose character has no more substance than a whore attitude and prostitute clothes. There is Kevin's manipulative and reserved girlfriend, Amy, whose deepest desire is apparently to be a badly dressed Cher in a pair of fishnet stockings with a pair of blue granny panties on top. Don't ask me how it works. Most likely the most entertaining character of all is KYLE. How these groups of friends are made is a question of questions. Kyle is a perverse slimy who can't spend an hour without self-stimulation. His hobbies include calling sex chats from other people's homes and most likely sniffing underwear. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds as the heroes search for the Hobgoblin: knee-high creatures (or even puppets) that, for some reason, try to travel beyond the boundaries of the local neighborhood. Each of the characters eventually experiences his wildest imagination that has nothing to do with having millions of dollars ... or the film has a big budget. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION SPOILERS NEXT: The plot twist at the end of this film will leave the observer asking "What?". The Hobgoblins are returned to the safe from ... their free will. Perhaps they lost patience waiting for dawn to wreak havoc, or perhaps the writers had the writer's cramp and decided not to worry about the ending. Upon returning to the safe, the old security guard reveals "What he learned in the army" and detonates explosives that destroy the safe, signaling the end of the evil Hobgoblin and the end of this roller coaster ride; better adapted to a ride on an escalator. <br /> <br /> The pure wickedness of this film is enough to send someone to tears. If you're going to watch it, I recommend some alcoholic beverages in advance to seriously consider the movie.
