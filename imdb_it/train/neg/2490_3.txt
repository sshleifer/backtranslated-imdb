What a grim goal these TV backers make, running out of their watch in their careers by tripping over a small rusted ship shield - the boat might be more appropriate. The entire production seems cheap and dreary, and is not helped by a "big name" star who is barely able to spit out the few lines he gave credibly. <br /> <br /> At no time does the supporting cast rise above the material; they are clearly looking at the clock here. Swap the scenes, take the check, go home and try to forget everything. <br /> <br /> It is not particularly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just completely anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a little extra cast. The pace is a bit bizarre; an embarrassing and tempting romantic sub-plot began only after the beginning of the main action, which makes it irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently assigned, and for being a fun game of "identifying bit Kiwi parters"; most of the cast are Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess graduates. The saddest thing about this production is that this film probably represents their big break.
