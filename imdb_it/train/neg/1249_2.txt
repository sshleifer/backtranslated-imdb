What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available and the assembled talent. It is not the fundamental rule for science fiction / drama to create in the public the voluntary suspension of disbelief. The 2001 POA creates a plausible start, making us suck, but later Mr. Burton forgets that his viewers have a functioning brain. The libertarian ruler of Helena Bonham, Carter's chimpanzee, the uselessness of human lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of suddenly primed human primitives), the massif and immediate human revolts are all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never projects a sense of true fear, danger or punishment in this upside-down world. Compared to the original, in which the nakedness of Chuck Heston metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and awe for his turn of events. Wahlberg in uniform maintains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an intrinsically extravagant situation, and we never really ask for his well-being. Unlike Heston, it seems he is never really in danger. Tim Burton should have used part of the f / x budget for some competent scripts. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood producers have ever bothered to fix screenwriters and threatening directors. Let them walk. The trained monkeys could have done just as well in Planet of the Apes 2001. I bet the repeated visions of this effort will be non-existent. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for the imagination. Another missed opportunity.
