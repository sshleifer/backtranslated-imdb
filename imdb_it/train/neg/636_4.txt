A couple of peasants struggle in life in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) buys O-Lan, his future wife, who becomes his slave (Luis Rainer). American stars appear in the main roles, speak with false accents and emphasize old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good wife, many children and the earth are the best things to have for men. They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big-budget film, in which many accomplices collaborate, great sets are built and special effects are produced, filmmakers cannot run the risk of hiring less popular actors. Luise Rainer won an Academy Award for this performance, which is certainly the worst of the film. Her unchanging face creates a barrier between her and the public. O-Lan should be the heart of the family and the best character to sympathize with. On the other hand, Paul Muni offers a better performance, showing his talents again. Another problem with the film is the ending. It looks like Franklin didn't know when to finish the photo. This film could be dangerous if taken as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
