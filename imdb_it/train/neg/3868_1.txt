If you are studying Welles and want to see how much has fallen after Citizen Kane, this movie will prove it. The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a presumed self-admitted to explain how it could fall into such a fiery scheme fails to explain the absurd court theatricality and the ridiculous plots of the plot that eventually result. Don't get involved in the high rating of this film in the db as I was; all i can imagine is that there are a lot of old Welles and Hayworth fans out there.
