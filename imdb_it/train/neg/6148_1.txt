First of all, the film was not true to the facts. I just saw the documentary a few days before and the film was nothing like it. First of all Nash was a genius of mathematics and this is what the film shouldn't have been about a story about a man who was cured and who eventually found love and so on. Also there are many scenes that were simply wrong - the scene in which he shot on a campus bike happened in his early university years later. In my opinion, Russell Crowe has not adapted to this part because he does not seem to be the intelligent / individualist type, so he is unable to interpret one. It would have been great if he had focused more on mathematics (similar to Pi) and not on too dramatized love. At this level ABM was too Hollywood and too superficial to be exceptional. I personally think he wasn't crazy or paranoid and that he was busy with something because people of that caliber tend to know more than us "minor mortals". 5/10
