The premise of an African American female Scrooge in the modern city in distress was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. Here, Mrs. Scrooge is a stingy banker who employs employees and clients in the largely poor and black neighborhood she lives. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that the roots of the story do not translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. Furthermore, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the public gets tired of this long before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a message movie that does not know when to stop. In the lead role, the talented Cicely Tyson offers overly tense performances and, sometimes, lines are hard to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it new and relevant, despite its very pertinent message.
