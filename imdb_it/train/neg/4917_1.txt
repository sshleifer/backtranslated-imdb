**** SPOILER WARNING **** <br /> <br /> Absolutely without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable comedies ever created for the screen. Absolutely impossible to take this seriously. It would take an important novel to list all the comic routines in it. During the glory days of his program, Carol Burnett and the company, which often made films take off, skewered him in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly fell ill with a slight cough and immediately the treatic music rose and everyone looked around wondering where it came from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and looks almost like Ryan O'Neal. The only thing more fun than this piece is the real movie. <br /> <br /> What a scene of death in the end. Jenny really looks like she's dying ... dying for her makeup artist to come in and give her some color. And, of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to sleep with them during the patient's final moments. The final scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the film world is an instant classic. He had many things to worry about. He never recovered from this.
