If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's fun, you'll be Shaq's great acting. First of all, putting professional players in the movies almost never works. Shaq was supposed to be the worst actor I've ever seen alongside Dennis Rodman who also made some bad movies. Well, in any way this movie is also bad because of the horrible child. I'd give a zero but it's impossible.
