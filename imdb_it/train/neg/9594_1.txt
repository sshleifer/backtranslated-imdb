I registered for IMDb only to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I have just finished filming this film, and the only thing that struck me was the fact that I somehow had the will to not stop it. <br /> <br /> I've seen quite a decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most sword fights carefree swords back and forth and hope the opponent is not doing the same. I have seen many films for students with better actions and stronger plots. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie with little action and virtually no signs of the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film has no action whatsoever and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmer / terrorist and her disturbed sister. The film has more plot lines, and none of them is really valid. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem may have been watching the dubbing, which was pretty bad. The whole cast mumbled all their jokes so it was hard to follow what was happening. But I had the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said wouldn't have saved the film in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you've heard of this futuristic action / ninja flick, then you've heard it wrong. This is what I thought it was when I heard about it, and now I've lost 90 minutes of my life. Don't let this happen to you. He steers well.
