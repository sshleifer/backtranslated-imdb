This film should not be seen because it wanted to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make this a remake of the classic bollywood movie "Sholay", but after having problems with the original creators he decided to go ahead with the project and ... I think I leave all the good parts of the film (acting, screenplay, songs, music, comedy, action etc.) and shooting the film only because it has already happened to hire the crew. Waste of money, waste of time. After making films like Rangeela, Satya and Company, he threw us a Coppola (Godfather); What were you thinking RGV? However, the story is, even if difficult to follow, is almost like the old sholay. Ajay Devgan playing Heero (Beeru, sholay) and Ajay, new guy on the block playing Ajay (Jay, sholay). Both "bad but funny" friends help a cop catch a bad guy. Later in the film, now retired cops hire them as personal security and protection from the hands of a highly sought after Bubban played by Amitabh Bachan. In case you are not watching Bollywood movies, good guys eventually win. There I just saved you 3 precious hours of your life!
