Tough guys, sexy women, bad words and an unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. You would think "Monster" would be fun ... but it really isn't. However, Tony Eisley and John Carradine are protagonists and in my book it's worth seeing at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who directed only the footage with his sons Andrea and Glenn (depicting characters named Andrea and Glenn, at a particularly inventive turning point) - received full credit. Considering how awful the end result was, Strock was probably glad he wasn't credited! "Monster" looks like a mid-late seventies TV movie, which is why I like to leave it in the background every now and then. As fun, it falls on his face, but as a reminder of another era and a vanished type of film, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
