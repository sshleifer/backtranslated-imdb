Needless to say, a group of half-naked men slap each other and punch each other. That's all. For about 5 minutes we see this. It is shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men who wander each other on the notes of scary music. It sounds interesting but there is no plot and really - the violence inherent in this has been disturbing. Even the eroticism in this is played but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like cutting-edge material might like it, but I find it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (occasionally) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a gay short film festival and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.
