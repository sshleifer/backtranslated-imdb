Anemic comedy-drama, an unhappy and seemingly rushed affair that sees Cher as a home-afflicted housewife who slowly befriends the hit-man who was hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, like the regular writer, has adapted the script of his work, with seasonal productions and dialogues back and forth that quickly tire the eye and the ear. An air of sadness hangs over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky fails to snatch Cher from his perpetual funk (she is listless). Despite all the best talents (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is fraudulent, with no substance to the story and characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 from ****
