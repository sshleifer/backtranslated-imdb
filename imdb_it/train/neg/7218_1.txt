There is a scene near the beginning after a shooting in which the horses run. If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush near the track. I thought I saw it bad but it is so. A white van in a western. Didn't they understand? Oh well, and I paid the best dollar for the rental. It will make you want to take your friends and put them all in 10 big and make a better movie. The speech was so slow, the acting was mostly OK but could not be taken seriously because of the poor nature of the shooting. There is a door for sheriffs that today looks like a door with a particular cut. I say watch this movie and move the cabin boy to # 2 in the worst of all time.
