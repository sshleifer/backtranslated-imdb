There have been very few films where I haven't been able to sit down. I passed the Battle Field Earth without problems. But this, this is one of the worst single films ever made. I understand that Whoopi Goldberg tried to act in it. I don't blame her. I would be ashamed to have this on a resume. I think it's a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls to the ground on his face. Well, it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging outside his back !!!!!! In the middle of the film I was still looking for a plot. I never found it. Save yourself the trouble of hiring this and save 90 minutes of your life.
