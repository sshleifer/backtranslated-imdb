If you look at the information from Corey Large here on IMDb, apparently there is a film called "Reload" in production (starting June 2008) in which he plays a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> First of all, how does such a lousy movie earn a sequel ... and second, was Sebastian not killed at the end of "Loaded"? <br /> <br /> I saw this early in the morning when I was fighting against insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I lost some points in the plot, but overall, it seemed really weak. The performance of Large was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised by all the people who comment on the pretty girls, since I thought the actress who plays Brooke was pretty, but not great.
