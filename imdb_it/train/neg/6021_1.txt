I can't believe they managed to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Spectacular bad acting, striking script and effects you could do on your average PC, incredible plot weaves ... a journalist who can get an inexperienced hostess an important job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this film is so subtle as to make you feel like they tried to beat you on the head with a life-size crucifix. This whole film will make the choir preach and make everyone laugh at a ridiculous waste of money. If the creators of this film really wanted to influence people towards Christianity and show what it really means to believe, they would have used the money to help truly needy people. Now, / that may have influenced some people to actually listen to them.
