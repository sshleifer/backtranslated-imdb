I, like many other Bachchan fans, have been looking forward to the Sholay remake. This film was not. Thank God they didn't allow him to use the name "Sholay" in the film's title. The Ram Gopal remake is not worthy of the title. The camera, the places, the costumes, the totally out of place dance, the combined dialogues to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this film because they needed money and Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first film. Abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay Ash's marriage? Save your money, your mind and your time, don't worry about this movie or DVD when it comes out.
