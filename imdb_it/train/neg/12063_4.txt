The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were big stars in vaudeville, but they made very few films. As in the case of some other artists of their time (George M. Cohan, Fanny Brice, Gertrude Lawrence) the most accessible piece of film for Fields and Seeley is the biographical film about them, in which they are played by other actors: 'Somebody Loves Me ', with Betty Hutton and that inimitable dancer of songs and dances Ralph Meeker. <br /> <br /> In their heyday, Fields and Seeley were so popular that another act of husband and wife vaudeville - - Jesse Block and Eve Sully - almost reached stardom by performing an almost identical act, becoming actually the "second team" Fields and Seeley. Offstage, however, there was a big difference in couples' life arrangements. Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites, paying room service fees for every meal they ate, and eventually ran out of money. Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely, ending up in a comfortable pension. <br /> <br /> The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short film are occupied by two pianists wearing gaiters. Apparently these two men had a certain nominal value in 1930, even though I never heard of them. Finally, Fields and Seely rush and start performing. Both have a lot of enthusiasm, and it's quite attractive. <br /> <br /> It bothered me that both actors continue to make movements as if they were about to break into a dance, but they never do enough until the third of the three songs they perform in this short. When they finally start to do the hoof, the results are not impressive. <br /> <br /> I was happy to have the opportunity to see these two main actors doing their vaude act. Now that I've seen it, I understand why they never became the protagonists of musicals. My vote for this: only 4 out of 10, and I'll stick with Block and Sully.
