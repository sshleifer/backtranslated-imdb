"The Incubus" is a mix between the good (a mysterious interesting murder), the villain (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly attacked scenes) and the strange (strong incestuous features, a strangely sleepy and rigid performance Cassavetes - that character really wanted to be so "wacko"?). Not as offensive as is known, but not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
