There's really not much to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's pretty harmless, but it's little more than a boring 1970's robbery movie. The film is neither intelligent nor sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a reconstruction of the tired plot of the old casino that was made to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the plot of the theft was designed by a 3-year-old child. Does the plan involve three women ?? one for uselessly and on a beautiful scale climbs the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to blow its cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand up by exposing its cleavage. This is pretty much everything. Complex, eh? In addition to Stella Stevens and her breasts mentioned above, the other women involved in the plot are not particularly memorable. The lady from Las Vegas is the co-star of Stuart Whitman. Stevens, his involvement in the film, is not highlighted by one of the most stupid fights ever set in a movie. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie. The 70s that I always like and some nice shots of Las Vegas around 1975. But the film itself is too boring to classify any higher than a 4/10 ?? and he's probably exaggerating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of a perfectly good split.
