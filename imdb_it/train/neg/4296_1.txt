I was about to say that this was the worst homosexual-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst movie of any genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know him "in trouble when a film starts with a" personal note "from the director, asking for the" understanding "of the audience for the" many challenges "that a director faces for the first time. audio is so ugly in many scenes that it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue, and this from a DVD version. Bad lights, bad sets, bad photography, mediocre script, generally bad acting, add up to make this "movie" unwatchable. I managed to get to the negative conclusion after several attempts, and immediately gave away the DVD that I stupidly bought in. I'm sure there are many challenges for a director for the first time, but don't try to try this lame attempt like a finished product I see from IMDb details that this was not only the first directing attempt by Richard Natale, but also the only one.This is the only positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
