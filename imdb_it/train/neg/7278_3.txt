This barely watchable movie was a bit difficult to bear. None of the segments is good, but at least the first one was slightly fun, and the central one was quite imaginative. The last one was simply brutal, and after passing two weak comedy shorts, the third was really painful to watch. Even by the low standards of a national Lampoon movie, this seemed particularly boring and joyless.
