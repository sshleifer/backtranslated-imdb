No, not the administration of GWB, the Decider / Strutter / Smirker - but the miniseries "Monarch Cove". Life must have understood what a dog was because the series was burned by two episodes at a time, most of them broadcast between 11:00 pm. Friday evening and 1 Saturday morning. As for why I looked at the whole thing, I can only implore sudden and convulsive weekly attacks of masochism. <br /> <br /> Most of the cast is unknown and is likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who run the only decent performances (Jones can't get past the entire series - lucky woman). Ward, by the way, has been aging quite well since his "Thorn Birds" days. <br /> <br /> The only common thread of the plot - which murdered the heroine's father who is unjustly convicted of dad's murder but is released after six years in jail - is extended for so long he concluded so hastily that you do not particularly care who dun him. There's a lot of "hot" sex, several murders and all kinds of rude behavior - virtually none of which is interesting or credible. Most of the cast is not particularly attractive and certainly has no talent. Writing and direction are on a par with the cast. <br /> <br /> If you stop until the end, the postcard is a (very minor) fun. <br /> <br /> CONSIDERED BY US!
