This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" easily directed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skill, humor ... repeats the same situation again and again. Does not show character development. It does not even show violent and / or sexual contents and does not add anything new to the psychopedic subgenre. So it should be shown to film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first film. <br /> <br /> BTW where the hell is the "talent"? there are scenes that have been shot almost identically; there are scenes that have two or more main strokes and it is pretty horrible to see the action jump from one main shot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves, as if "the very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual skills. Actors who play the main roles behave like amateurs and the supporting cast is hardly credible. There are more holes than there are in the script (if there ever was one) ... <br /> <br /> A really discouraging film and a talented director.
