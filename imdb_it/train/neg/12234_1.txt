I think it was useless to produce a second part of a film like "My Girl". "My Girl" was a great movie, but it is ridiculous to do a second part of a movie where one of the main characters (Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J.) dies. The story was over after the first movie. I wonder why someone tried to find a way to get the story going. It was meaningless!
