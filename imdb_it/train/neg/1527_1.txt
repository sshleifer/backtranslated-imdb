If you really want to really waste two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Watch the TV listings. 2) Find the movie "Men in white". 3) When 'Men in white' lights up, sit down and watch. <br /> <br /> And that's all. After spending two hours of bad wordplay, terrible (and not so funny) film references, and experiencing something with perhaps the lowest production values ​​ever made in recent history, you will have wasted two hours of your life, and you wonder exactly why. <br /> <br /> Why did I do it? I was stupid enough to think that this movie could actually be a little good. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, if you're old enough to remember the Power Rangers, you might notice some familiar faces during the movie. Presumably to save on production costs, Saban (who also does Power Rangers), has decided to freely sprinkle the old costumes of the monsters from everyone's favorite toy generation franchise for the film. I've seen some old monsters from the episodes I've seen since I was a child, so I guess we can at least say that it has a certain nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But if you want to see the current power of Rangers monsters, go and watch the Power Rangers. It's much better than this piece of junk. (And this is saying something!)
