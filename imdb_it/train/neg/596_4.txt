Basically what we have here is little more than a remake of the hilarious 1970s classic kitsch 'Death Line' which ironically was like this cobbler, also partly filmed in the disused underground station of Aldwych. <br /> <br /> Making good use of the Jubilee Line platforms now out of use at Charing Cross as well as the aforementioned Aldwych, this film basically contains the same plot: a crazy zombie killer killer in tunnels that prey on lost passengers who they missed the last train - originality is not the forte of this movie point. <br /> <br /> In reality unfortunately there are no strengths. The gore goes from the poor to the unnecessarily too bloody, while the sub-Gollum nutter is never completely explained as it seems little more than an underdeveloped plot device. <br /> <br /> Franke Polente has little to do with a subtle script that would knock down a lot of tunnels and scream from time to time, indeed it was pretty much like everyone else in this movie, played by a little dog and a pack of domesticated mice . <br /> <br /> If you are gruesome the films set in the London subway are your bag, or if you just want to "locate the position of the subway", they collect them on DVD when it hits a business bin. If you are looking for a classic horror, go find a copy of Death Line (aka Raw Meat). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a well-written and high-quality film, you will have to change trains .....
