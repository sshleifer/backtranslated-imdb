An idiotic dentist discovers that his wife has been unfaithful. So, no new plot here. However, the authors managed to create a stupid and disgusting film. If you like to watch children throw up, or see a dentist who imagines pulling his wife's teeth out in a damn horror, go and see (or rent) the movie. If not, move on to something else (MY FAIR LADY, someone?)
