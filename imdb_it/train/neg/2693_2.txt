<br /> <br /> Although the lead actress is STRAKINGLY beautiful, the plot has little chance of being accepted because too many details that distract the audience during the unfolding of the story. <br /> <br /> It is possible to believe that the students of the middle-class adolescents of the 1950s easily gave up their virginity without thinking of marriage with the thirty-year-olds they barely know, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> It can be believed that high school teenagers are very self-confident and self-confident while interacting with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience has often been that teenagers they feel very clumsy and act awkward as they experiment in the adult world. > <br /> It can be believed that an expert doctor does not know the pungent odor of Stroptomycin - the evil fermenting by-product of busy terrestrial microbes - and does not find that an insipid and insipid powder is false, but I do not think so. <br /> <br /> It can be believed that 30-year-old train drivers can let them in, go inside a public school in a social school and create problems, but I think social schools are traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent it. <br /> <br /> One last louse, throughout Hey Babu Riba, the five teenage friends referred to them as the quartet. There is probably an explanation of why the FIVE was FOUR, but since it was never detailed, each reference distracts from every scene. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't sound real to me.
