How did 4 out of 16 previous voters give this film a 10? How could more than half of the previous voters give him a 7 or more? Who votes here? I can only assume that they are mainly children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie anyway. The story is stupid; acting is difficult even to think of as acting; the characters are without character; and the dialogue is terrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that is never retransmitted, I suggest you read a book.
