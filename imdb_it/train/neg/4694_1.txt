I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while participating in the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. However, I was eager to get rid of the seats as soon as Big Rig ran out. Big Rig is composed of several "big rig" pilots who aim to deliver goods driven through the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, but the filmmakers have never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the plot unfolds as much as the film's maps are intended to drive, but they never do. At most, we get lost. We - the public - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the narrative, end up somewhere but without direction, position or plot. Why we are here? Where we are? How did we get here? The narration is sloppy and the intention of the directors to "humanize" a group of people they consider "neglected" and "invisible" appears unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here is in the perspective of administrators instead of truck drivers. The directors carry on their naive assumptions about truck drivers and then simply modify the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story has no tension, the film is too long (it should be a 15-minute sketch), the big question of "So what" is never answered and the whole movie is a piece of transparent propaganda that makes nothing to deepen "illuminate" (as the directors claim) the outside world over large riggers.
