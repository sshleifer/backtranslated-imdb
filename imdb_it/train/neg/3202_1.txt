If you hear these three words spoken for you ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... <br /> <br /> Final Justice is a low-budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas city of name Geronimo (pronounced as Heronimo). He is an ugly, slimy and rude character who is hunting for a criminal in Malta who killed his friend in Texas. His partner actually collapses twice in the film. Very bad editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in jail 4 or 5 times in this movie, making the plot go nowhere fast. Also, shoot everyone like it's in the wild west. I guess nobody told him it was the 20th century. A female police officer is asked to show it in Malta (which looks like Elaine by Seinfeld) and she is the only one who can stand the red neck. It must be crazy! <br /> <br /> Strippers in the bar are the funniest characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the film and I started bonding with squalid women. Well, at least it was better than watching Geronimo try to run away from something. The finish is imperfect and somewhat predictable, and I was glad it was finally finished. You'll never forget that last line from Joe Don Baker in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine what it was like in the TRE Bond films ... very strange! Anyway, if you feel like laughing, then you see this on MST3K sometimes. Also, I heard his other bad movie (among many), Mitchell's Mitch3K version was released on DVD by Rhino. I can not wait to see it!
