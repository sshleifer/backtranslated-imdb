and forget it. Completely. If you really need to see Madonna acting, rent "Body of Evidence", at least Willem Defoe is in that. <br /> <br /> In this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to silence the dialogue. You will not miss anything. Bruce Greenwood is wasted, Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop, and Madonna is so horrible, it becomes fun. Because they had to slaughter the original film in this mess, I'll never know; I guess they thought he was "bankable". Madonna, as an actress, certainly is NOT. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original 1979 movie, however, you'll like it and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.
