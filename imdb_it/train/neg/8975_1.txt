... said a couple coming out of the cinema just as I was entering to watch this. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? Different traits for different people, after all. Well, no. They were kind. Godard has published a work that is passionate (Contempt), fun (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (My Life to Live). This is just a dull intellectualism, which quickly scratches the nerves. During my performance, literally half the audience came out at the end of the film. If only I had been so wise.
