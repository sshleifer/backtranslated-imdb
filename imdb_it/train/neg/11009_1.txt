I voted for this film as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be really cool. "Guaranteed to offend ... everyone!" the trailer said. Well ... he offended me, because this movie really sucks. It is certainly not a comedy, because I laughed for two seconds during the whole movie. And what happens to all the gays in this movie? I am not gay and I have no problems with those that are, but what is the use of adding so many gay scenes in a so-called comedy film, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I imagine the director is a homosexual denier, or something like that. <br /> <br /> So my advice is: if you want to waste money, go hire a good comedy you've seen millions of times before, you'll be better off watching this Mother Of All Lousy comedy. It really is total crap.
