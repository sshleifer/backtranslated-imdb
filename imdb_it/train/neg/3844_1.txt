First of all, I would just like to say to all those who have seen this film, that the actor who plays the "Transvestite" is one of my friends, his name is Robert Dugdale, he is an exceptional actor, even if he doesn't say much about his filmography , has been in several shows and musicals. He currently resides in Terrace B.C. is where I come from, he comes to our house almost every Saturday * laughs * Ok, now about the film, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it, because it's not a movie worth looking at, the main reason why I found a bad movie, it's never in its place, it keeps bouncing over time, so it's pretty hard to follow in some places, and secondly, it's really boring * laughs * Even if acting is great, the film is not comparable .
