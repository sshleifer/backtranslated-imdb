This movie made me go. The title was perhaps the greatest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent film about a zombie epidemic and their quest to conquer the United States and a group of solitary survivors, band together, and plan to eliminate the zombies. DEAD WRONG! He is a psychopathic policeman with the weakness of killing his female arrests who gets what he wants to say when a pack of zombie women gets up from their graves to get a real revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or a county involved. Where to start with the gravity of this cinematic disaster has caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First of all, zombie women resemble Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and pale face. What are zombies, but intelligent, questionable, questionable cannibal killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive primary needs? These zombie women walk like catwalk and catwalk models, they talk like they're in a poor film noir and they don't behave like real zombies. Of course there is eating and killing, but where is the lack of mind and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and raises the question: "why can't zombies be beautiful machines to kill violets?" I would say that this film would be considered a really bad indie film, produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombies too much, it is an insult and even with regards to fear.
