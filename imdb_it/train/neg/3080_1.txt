Hi hee hee. This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks. I remember the day I saw it for the first time on MST. The sun was shining, it seemed like a good day. then, I saw this product by Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls that triggered chaos in the terrifying 1980s party. Kevin, crazy freak, tries to impress his girlfriend, runs a job as a security assistant, fights with rakes and many other things in this series of very poorly made pictures. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is necessary as the film shows. An army guy and his crazy sex girlfriend will blow you off a cliff, and the cheater friend who takes sex over the phone will have you say "He has nice red shorts." Besides, I really hated the old security guard and wanted to have an accident in the supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait for the Scum Club scene. Ask for Road Rash. <br /> <br /> I advise you that after watching this film, a good month to regain your senses and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a nice kick in the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapster called Hobgoblins.
