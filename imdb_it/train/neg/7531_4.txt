This is apparently a film about multiple pain. As such, it should move viewers and make them empathic with the difficult situation of the main characters. However, his irritating postmodern style makes him almost incomprehensible. The camera passes continuously from one scene to another, from one personal crisis to the next, creating a blurred and disjointed effect. Most characters seem to live aimless and unstructured lives, held together by their professional commitments. (It also extends the credibility that a man who has just been given what amounts to a probable death sentence, will happily entertain himself into a sexual relationship with a woman he has just met). The plot (if there is a plot) is difficult to follow. In short, the overall effect is rather disappointing. Despite everything, acting is generally good and some scenes are quite powerful.
