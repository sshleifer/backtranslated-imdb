I went to this film with the expectations, the clamor, which would be insightful and uplifting. Definitely something more than an economic promotion for the band "Wilco". Instead there is a lot of whining and whining about the "trial", a dishonorable and unilateral portrait of the members of a band that was expelled by the lead singer / composer, an instinctive confession by the member's fallen friend for like 18 years - saying that "friendship had run its course", and this plaintive and shameless story about how one the record label "hurt their feelings" by downloading them, just because the band could immediately get 50 offers from others labels (oh, tension ... no!) They did their best to make it look like a variety, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors that generated a tragedy that didn't exist. This does not even take into account the long periods in which we receive many of their last songs pushed in full without any plot, intuition or even a good job in cinematography. Attempts to have emotional sincerity or a reasonable perspective on life have made me feel sick. <br /> <br /> From the film, this band sounds like a bunch of little cowardly children who wander around to find a voice that they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music, which they surely aren't . And I thought music sucked, and I couldn't even understand the lyrics because of the singer's mumbling style. <br /> <br /> I give him a 2/10.
