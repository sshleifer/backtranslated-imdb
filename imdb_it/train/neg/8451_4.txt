I have to admit I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the acting was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A top Hollywood movie. But ... Nobody mentioned this so far (at least in the last 20 comments), when he arrived at the classroom scenes and the character of Brat Pitt followed his plan to save his two friends, who are rightly accused of murder, I felt cheated This movie insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Attention spoiler !! <br /> <br /> Why did someone accept his false alibi, witnessed by the priest? If these two boys had been with him, why shouldn't they say it during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were the judge or member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to give away the motive of the murderers? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end, the story is very weak, and this makes me angry. This film had great potential. 4/10
