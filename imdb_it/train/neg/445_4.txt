One thing that surprised me about this film (and not in a positive sense) is that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems proud to be the major historian on the subject of Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians who worked on this film, considering how many of the real events have been changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said he never wanted Lena to sleep with Goebbels, but in that case, why did he give the impression that it was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the exit of men, like the disaster of Stalingrad, or the fear of the Nazis that the international press, based in Berlin, would have known about the protest. <br /> <br />, why did the whole plot play the second fiddle to a weak family tie plot that has been repeated over and over again? Certainly something as beautiful as its history could bring! In some places, it was as if the film had two narrative lines that seemed to have very little in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its purpose, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a pity, because done better, could have made a major impact .
