Although the cast of this film was admirable, particularly Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott, the quality of the writing was so poor that it would have been impossible for any actor or director to make this film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> My wife and I decided that the reason we watched the whole movie was that it was like a train crash, and it was almost impossible to walk away. It is possible that we "hoped" that the message would eventually manifest itself, and that we would be able to gather meaning from this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. <br /> <br /> Of course the public may have been able to "make sense" of this twisted tale, a credit to the ingenuity of the human brain to make sense of the absurd. The screenwriters, however, did NOTHING to facilitate this innate need that they seem to have to find meaning. <br /> <br /> It was evident that the people involved were simply following the movements of their respective trades, and that any inherent passion for the characters or for the story was secondary or non-existent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TV-made movies seemed to devolve over the years. While communicating a message to the public may have been the primary interest of writers in the past, contemporary writers and producers seem to condescend towards their audience, focusing primarily on manipulating us to "stay tuned" through the incessant advertising that appears to be the only reason why films like Surrender, Dorothy are made.
