Do not drink the refrigerant. <br /> <br /> This is a piece of opinion disguised as a documentary. And to name it as a "truth" is just crap. The global warming debate is far from over and will be over only when the eco-zombies begin to recognize the mountain of evidence contrary to their beloved theory. Only Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you'll find a flood of information that refutes almost every link in Gore's chain of logic. The reason why it is so important for people to educate themselves is the disastrous economic impact that global warming prevention measures would have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, some time and a little common sense can find many reasons why this theory is not even remotely credible. Don't just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no in-depth analysis to do, really. There are simply too many alternative possibilities and counter-tests for the theory of having even the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so unstoppable, in fact, that it could be the biggest hoax in the course of human existence. It's time for people to start talking about this kind of propaganda, and it's time for people to admit to themselves and others that you can both be environmentalists and recognize the obvious conclusion that global warming hysteria is a big lie.
