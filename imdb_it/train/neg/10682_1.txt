So I'm trying to rent a DVD and come across this movie called "End Game". He plays James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has a synopsis of a political thriller taught. It's worth a look then. Or so I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> End Game has almost the most ridiculous plot I've ever had the displeasure of enduring. Now, being something of a whodunnit, I can't really tear it to pieces as I wish without "ruining it" for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity. But questions like "Why did they do it?" And "Where did they get the resources to get it out?" they are too abundant following the film's unintentionally hilarious conclusion. <br /> <br /> As for acting, do you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor realized he had made a terrible mistake in signing up for a film, and this then shows in their performances? This is one of those. Accompany this with a ridiculous script and a seriously imperfect and irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison. <br /> <br /> Of course, this did not go to the cinema, and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room; it's scary.
