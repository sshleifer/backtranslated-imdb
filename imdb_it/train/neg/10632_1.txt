There are so many wrong statements in this so-called "documentary" that I found myself shouting on television. Bart Sibrel may be able to produce a flashy DVD, but it is sadly lacking in appearance to the science behind his claims. <br /> <br /> It relies on not being accurate, not telling the full story, or the old favorite "government always lies", and people believe what they are told and not controlling accuracy or details behind the statements. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, his "exclusive" or "unpublished" movie is freely available on the Internet from various sites. <br /> <br /> Further reading the circumstances surrounding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to get interviews and used the creative editing of the answers to promote his opinions. <br /> <br /> All the statements made by Mr. Sibrel about "inaccuracies", "errors" or "whistleblowing" in the Apollo program have been deepened disapproval. <br /> <br /> How can I recover those 40 minutes of my life?
