Question: how does a bourgeois director treat a subject like immigration? Answer: turning it into a parable of existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we returned in the early 1990s, immediately after the disintegration of the Eastern bloc and subsequent floods of immigrants into the European Union, and what better way to tackle the topic of making a a film about a existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated social class politician, his rich existentially alienated wife, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the background, immigrants seek political asylum in a nameless Greek village near the borders. I believe that in this way Angelopoulos can show some social awareness, while dealing with the problematically existential upper classes. I mean honestly, the scene where a high-ranking army officer curses his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you vomit. <br /> <br /> However, it can't be that bad, after all Angelopoulos is a master of film art, right? Mistaken. It is at this point that his mannerisms begin to become too artificial, a bit like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks are manifested: there are blurred windows, blurred lights, a strange marriage, a walk along the river bank and people with yellow coats. Mastroianni also opens up new horizons for most sleepwalking performances. Really avoid. Go for his first films.
