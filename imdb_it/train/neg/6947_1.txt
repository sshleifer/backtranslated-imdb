Without doubt one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. The story focuses on four women driven to rob banks with whom we should somehow sympathize. It is difficult to sympathize with the characters who continue to make such stupid decisions. Oh no, the cops are doing us, they know who we are, what we do? ... We borrow another bank, then we're out of here! What!?! Each character is a stereotype and it is easy to tell who will die.
