I went to see the Omega Code with a group of other Christians for a total of about 15 people. We all expected a good Christian movie. What we got was a terribly painful, exhausting and rather boring attempt in a movie. He has good production values ​​but also has poor acting, a weak script with disgusting dialogues and a real sense of orientation. From the first 15 minutes we all knew it would be a long night. We all hated him, and some people in our group put this film as a smell of cheese more than "Anaconda". None of us could believe that the film had lasted less than 2 hours. Showy effects and clear-cut cinematography can't save this bad movie. I'd give a 3 out of 10, and the rating is just so high because I rented the abominable "movie" Werewolf (1996) the night before seeing this movie.
