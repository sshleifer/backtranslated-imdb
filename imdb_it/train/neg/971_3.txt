After reading some great reviews on this film I thought I'd give him a watch and after being disappointed by the movie I thought I'd give him a personal review. This is my first ever so naked with me. <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to detract from the horror of the genre because in no way is it horrible or scary at the very least (except for some weak attempts unfortunately unfortunately, one of which worked on me.) I would say that calling this film is a thriller that drives him because I wasn't particularly enthusiastic! The film is about a spoiled and mischievous girl who faints a couple of times. During these times he visits a house he has designed, after each visit he decides to add something else to the house to make it a little more lively, one of the characteristics is a sad boy who is also sick in reality. As he makes friends with the boy, he realizes that his imaginary world he created is actually better than the real world in which he finds himself. Until he adds his father constantly away at home, due to a disapproval the father becomes bad and she and the boy must run away from his clutches. <br /> <br /> To think that it's an attempt to be a slightly sweeter version of A Nightmare On Elm Street, but it's more like a trip to the beach. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, my generous 3/10 is hoping that at least one of you will just watch this sad!
