F * ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrible movies in my day, but this takes p * ss! <br /> <br /> I honestly can't put into words how bad this movie is. Besides the plot that isn't really there, the comic crap acting, the hilarious and terrible excuses for the zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this movie is stupid, useless, disgusting or embarrassing. I express to anyone who wants to see this film ... don't do it! <br /> <br /> I am ashamed to say that I have this in my rack. It is hidden right at the damn bottom of the huge pile. I could not even give this excuse on horseback for a distant film. It's so bad.
