A concept with potential, and it was fun to see these two icons together, but ... Rudolph's bright nose didn't require the "explanation" offered in this film - very similar to The Force in the Star Wars movies they didn't have need the explanation of "medichloriani in sangue". But above all, the film left me cold because of Winterbolt's too complicated plot to destroy Santa Claus. He has the power to make suggestions in people's minds, so why does he do things so indirectly? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the icy family ... Pinky and the Brain's exaggerated comedies and "Phineas and Ferb's" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (who are made for this and play to laugh ) seems simple and direct compared to that of Winterbolt, which we expect to take seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a particularly strange (and amusing) moment in which a character throws his two guns at the villain, like the boomerangs. I understand if they don't want to have guns shot in a family movie, but then why do they have guns in the first place?
