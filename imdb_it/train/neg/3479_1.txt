I went to see this movie in theaters and was shocked when I entered the room. There was just me and my girlfriend! This shouted to me that this movie is not very good. <br /> <br /> Not to my surprise, the film was terrible. Ben Affleck plays a guy who buys a family for Christmas. It is a very predictable narration with him that falls in love with the girl who hates him. His acting is OK, but for the comical aspect of the film he is not very good. The plot is scarce and the comedy almost non-existent. <br /> <br /> However, there are some positive points. For example, the family is falling apart and the mother is very funny. <br /> <br /> I hope this review prevents other people from wasting their money. I was very embarrassed when I left the room !!!
