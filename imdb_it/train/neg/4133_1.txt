I watched this movie with some friends a couple of months ago, still laughing today thinking of some of the stupidest ones. The first few scenes were hilarious. I don't want to ruin anything for those who wish to see it, I wouldn't want to spoil the laughter. Needless to say, for as long as I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the meaning of all the characters in this movie was. Towards the end, however, we were all bored, because the initial hilarity and shock of a movie due to this randomness ended. There is no plot and no trace of decent acting. The characters are as developed as those of a book "Learn to read" in kindergarten. They also managed to make a lesbian sex scene unattractive.
