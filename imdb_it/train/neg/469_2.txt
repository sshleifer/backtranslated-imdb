Mad Magazine could have a lot of crazy people working for this ... but obviously someone had a good sense when the powers denied this celluloid waste ... the editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid. .. and the only reason a two out of ten comes is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of his clothes and we get a nice shot in the chest ... I never thought I'd be sorry for Ralph Macchio making the decision to be in this thing, but I ... and I feel really bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have appeared in this piece of ... movie ... at least Mr. Leibman had the courage to Refuse to put his name somewhere in the movie ... and he comes out ... there are actually copies of this thing with the Mad start sequence still on it ... if you can find one, take it because probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie that is worth everything ... and a note for the people of IMDb.com ... there is no way to ruin this film for anyone ... the producers have ruined it for themselves ...
