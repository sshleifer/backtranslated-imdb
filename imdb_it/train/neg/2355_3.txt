I have almost always been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the film would be improved automatically if only those extremely annoying songs had been cut. However, things changed quickly after seeing that horrible Black (without songs) and this movie, (many songs). While Black was weak to the extreme, he offers a compelling story with strong acting and good direction. The songs were almost random and merged almost perfectly with the film. Certainly no woman splashed water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources as she turned wildly through the streets at night. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and impassive approach used by the director. There was no overflight and almost every scene was completely credible. <br /> <br /> I recommend these films to Hindi-speaking people with at least a minimal understanding of Mumbai life. The first because English subtitling was below average and contained many errors that sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the real statement. The latter because you will surely appreciate the accuracy of the representation once you have lived it alone. <br /> <br /> I would certainly have classified it as a work worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the viewer drivers were a nice touch and served simultaneously as a source of genuine humor, as well as another perspective on the whole mix. The film is not available in some places, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that detract from the general direction of the film. I also thought that a couple of more sad scenes weren't done very well. It was a fun touch to watch, rather than arouse feelings of sadness and the whole scene tended to look a little silly. These are minor problems though, because the film, overall, is really a rare treat to watch. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a cynical, pessimistic and refreshing vision! Actors, not "heroes": this is the key. An opportunity to see credible human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. A look behind the scenes on the extent of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
