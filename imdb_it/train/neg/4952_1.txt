Ok, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I also read a batman comic from time to time. So, as you can imagine, I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was VERY disappointed. This series is nothing. He does not even begin to confront the original series. It's like a long TOY advertisement. No depth. And what the hell was with the Joker? Who, in my humblest opinion, is the best villain of Batman of all time and have KILLED him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I wish I could say that there was something in this series that was far from creative or interesting. In short (because believe me, I could say a lot more) DON'T waste your time on this show or your money.
