<br /> <br /> Once I ignored some of the implausibility, this was actually a pretty decent horror / monster movie. So, I'll give some of the positive points in the first place: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially while roaming the galleries in search of lunch (hint: she likes humans). - the action was quite incessant and, after a weak start, I was completely absorbed by the plot. - I'm sorry to say, I was a bit of a cheer for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the film. <br /> <br /> Now for the implausible stuff ** maybe some spoilers **: - if you were hunting for a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD, you'd charge yourself in his cave with a barrel of gunpowder under his arm ? Duh. - a female character with an all-American name, blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Eh? - a lead scientist whose Slavic accent can be cut with a knife, and supposedly born in Chicago, educated in the United States? - a military helicopter pilot who does his repairs, flies with a huge transport helicopter without other crew members, and is an experienced marksman and a soldier in combat? OK. Uh Huh. I won't even say he gave 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. <br /> <br /> It's even better than some of the Japanese monster movies of the 1960s, but not by much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, although of course the ending has left this possibility open. Or maybe they will hire a real director next time. <br /> <br /> Despite everything, I gave this movie a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
