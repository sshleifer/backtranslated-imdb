This type of "inspirational" saccharin is enough to make you sick. He telegraphs his feelings as the biggest traffic light on earth. It removes its interpretation and feeling from the public by making choices for it. The grand finale is swimming in a weeping orchestration that must function as a jumper on a dead machine; I guess you need this tip to hear if you are stupid enough to watch a movie as simple and mushy as this. Streep lights up and you wonder if it really has the depth of feeling on display or if it's just that --- a display, turned on and off like a light. Because I can't see for the life of me how he could ever find life in such a beautiful film. Although based on a true story, and a source of inspiration, I'm sure the set, execution and performances sound like a third-rate television movie or a middle school drama.
