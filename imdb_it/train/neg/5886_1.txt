I would have left the film halfway if I hadn't been with people I liked. The film is based on real incidents, but it's so exaggerated that it didn't seem real. I have a bit of psychology, I have a lot of psychotherapists and I've met really crazy people, so I don't think people like this don't exist. But in the film, the only characters that always seemed human were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an intriguing diversion - very sexy with a sense of mischievous amusement). There were some funny moments, but the general tone of the film was sad, bizarre and bad. What a waste of an exceptional cast! As I watched them go through their shifts, I felt like I was watching an acting class. This was brought home during the credits, when a couple of people were shown sitting there, without acting, without talking. Those few moments were more fun than the previous 2 hours.
