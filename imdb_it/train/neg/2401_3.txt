I have seen best teenage werewolf films in my day, but this one takes the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts the "c" in cheese-fest. The quality of the stars in this film is not bad. Just the way it was made just sends rolling downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, a football player from the 1950s who ends up not getting old due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the film was the violin. He drove all crazy! Ed McMahon plays the ultra-conservative father who met his end of his bullet. Adam's father, Alan, plays a shrink that doesn't seem to be the best in his game. After all these years Tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, so he will have the chance to capture in his state. More laugh than spilled blood, this movie is just a start in the 80s, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars.
