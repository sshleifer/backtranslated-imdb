this was the most useless film I've ever seen as there was no plot and the actors didn't seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot, I laughed so much that my ribs started to hurt. the piece where the old men when capturing Robert Duvall was ridiculous. at the directorial level, making a film noir does not involve many sequences of rain and unnecessary close-ups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with inconsistent scenes. since this was based on a "manuscript" by John Grisham, I do not consider it as one of his books for film adaptations as it does not show any suspense and compelling plot as films like "the company" or "the producer of rain" .
