This is almost certainly the worst western I've ever seen. The story follows a particularly widespread formula in westerns and martial arts films: the hero learns that the family / friends were killed, so the hero prepares to take revenge, foils the inefficient lawman, saves the damsel beloved by the abduction and kills the archenemy expert in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it wouldn't be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophisticated execution you've ever seen. Scripting is excruciatingly simple and offensive; it seems that a high school student wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; sometimes it seems dubbed. Cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; of course, some artists could blame the script, but others can't use that excuse. I hope to never see Chris Lybbert again in a speaker role; every time he says a joke that should be angry or bad, he does nothing but lower the tone of his voice and looks just like a kid trying to behave like a macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, take a look at his dudes (if you dare to watch this movie): wear these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard and dirty cowboy. If you like the weird movie rates that only serve to worship the imagined greatness of Hopalong Cassidy, take this, but if you have more than two neurons, look at something else.
