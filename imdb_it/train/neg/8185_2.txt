Oh my. I decided to go to the movies with some friends, with the desire to watch one of those mild and good-humored Christmas movies, and I'm sick of it. The film has failed. Point. Paul Giamatti, who I consider a good actor, played his character and performed horribly, along with Vince Vaughn, who has always been my favorite. They try to turn a Christmas movie into a new style. Kind of ugly, mixed with good, but everything turned out to be very wrong. The first ten minutes weren't so bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It has not improved, the percentage has remained unchanged, there has been no character development, and certainly it is one of the worst Christmas films ever invented. Don't look at it, whatever you do.
