Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. The screen has rarely been smeared with an inflated jumble of semi-elaborate conspiracy theories, puritan prudery and meaningless New York words. Most of the story is set in Viciente, a place in Cristian in the Peruvian jungle. He thinks that Tolkien's Rivendell meets the Baku planet of Star Trek, inhabited by obtuse followers of a cult of love and peace not so mysterious but surprisingly small. Thanks to the gruesome acting and the bad design of the production (the rainbow-colored display of the mysterious "healing" energy is particularly horrible), "The Celestine Prophecies" appears and feels like a discarded episode of the "Twilight Zone" of the 80 . Mistakes of fact regarding church history and nomenclature abound. I can't believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be a part of it. Perhaps it was made without his Bowfinger-style consent. May the Lord have pity on the director, the screenwriter, the author of the novel and the poor souls who see the film or read the book.
