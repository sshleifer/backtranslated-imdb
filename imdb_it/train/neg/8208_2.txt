"Hi everyone, I have an idea, we found this egg-shaped thingie from outer space, so why don't we thaw it and open it?" "Yes, I know it would be the stupidest thing a scientist can do, and it could be full of bacteria or viruses contaminants unknown to the earth and potentially could wipe out the human race, but hey, I want to know what's inside." "And nobody tells NASA that it could take us away." "Wow, this thing gives off vibrations!" "Yes, the very strong ones on the contact so don't touch it but it's ok to open it". "Hi, handsome, look at my lips." (Later that day); "DO NOT OPEN"!!!!! Uh oh, we have to run to the lab and tell him not to open it because we don't have phones, radios, or intercoms, even if we have another billion here. "I've never seen such an organic technology!" "Yes, let me take this stick and stab him." "I'm leaving here, I don't care if I kill the other 6 billion people on Earth, no one nukkin me!" "Look, it's the friendly aliens of" The Abyss "! They want us to come with them." THE END
