I was looking forward to watching this film and realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was overwhelmed by the useless oath. Now I'm not an idiot at all, but screaming obscenities at each other doesn't make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is undoubtedly one of the worst actors in the world right now (testifies to his performance in the terrible god Vita di Roba) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. To avoid. How many others of these films "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" we have to suffer before the directors realize that the f-word, the c-word etc. does not replace the correct dialogue.
