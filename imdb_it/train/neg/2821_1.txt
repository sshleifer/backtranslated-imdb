I only saw this movie once, and that was enough for me. The film has a really small plot and seems to be nothing more than continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this film because it was Zoe Trilling from the second "Night of the Demons"; and I wanted to see her play a normal person. Unfortunately, Tobe Hooper's script barely starts and goes nowhere while Robert Englund dominates the film and chews the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding from this movie!
