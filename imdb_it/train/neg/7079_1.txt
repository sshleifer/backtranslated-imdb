There is no reason to worry about renting this movie. From the opening credits, I knew I was in trouble. <br /> <br /> It was filmed as if it were a soft porn movie, but there is nothing erotic about it. The look in the world of sex addiction is intriguing, but only up to a certain point. <br /> <br /> Boring sex scenes, bad plot and cameo by Ed Begley Jr. and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to save this movie.
