I have seen many horror movies in my time, all absurdly bad, but none reaches the depths to which this piece of garbage is lowered. This film made me even more angry as I watched him trying to figure out exactly what this movie was about. Now, after seeing it, I understand - in a sense - what was happening and why, but the film itself is too confusing to be funny when you look at it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of gratuitous violence, one-off jokes that show the incredible intuition of his characters ("The highway belongs to me ... ME!"), And enough nudity to distract us sufficiently from the "plot" " , but you will still leave this film alone and take advantage of it, like a puppy that is no longer wanted and is left in a box on the side of the road.
