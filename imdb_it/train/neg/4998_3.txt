this one of the best celebrities shows a reality never seen. we can see the concerts we can see the life of Britney, I love the five episodes. I have always been surprised by Britney and by the subjects of the show I think some people don't look at the show at all, as it can be a fantastic person. she's really funny and very kind and loves her fans and we can see how she loves her job. I don't give a 10 because of the fact that he's a real idiot and he doesn't seem to like Britney at all. I do a second season of this great show because it shows some people what Britney really is. Go Britney at your best and you'll never leave our hearts.
