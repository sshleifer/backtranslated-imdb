This film was a real disappointment for me. I have been a Gram Parsons fan for a long time, and when I found out that they were making a film about him I was very excited, I got the VHS movie when it came out and I was disgusted by what I saw, the film was not about his life, but the consequences of his death. I thought it would be a descent film on Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a film about his life, not about his infamous death. I was very disappointed. I wish people would look at his life more than his death. The only good thing about this film was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons fan.
