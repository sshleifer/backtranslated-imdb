This may not be the worst comedy of all time, but it's close. The producers of this film have stolen an hour and a half of my life, and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is fun for about 10 minutes. His high-pitched voice and his wild beating are beginning to age, and then you realize that the rest of the film is much worse. He falls into a long line of ex-SNLs who tried to film. Some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. There is not much in between in this category. Even though Chris Farley was brilliant, and then okay, and then he's not so funny, and so dead ... so I guess he reached the whole spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. <br /> c
