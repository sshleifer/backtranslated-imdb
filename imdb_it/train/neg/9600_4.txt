Very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation film without a real story, but which benefits from its incredibly charming lead actress and a handful of beautiful and gruesome makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful girl of twenty, bringing with her the trauma of being raped at age 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of an ancestor who was said to be a werewolf. He kills his brother-in-law during a night meeting and is presented in a hospital. He escapes again, however, and devours more men randomly while he is looking for policemen, doctors and relatives. It's all very nice to see and hear (a truly exceptional soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity becomes rather annoying. Fortunately, the protagonist Annik Borel rarely wears clothes and fills the boring moments by dancing naked around the fire. The film is too long, too strange and too forgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end, when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe that his film was based on true facts. Yeah, for sure...
