I'll be honest, the reason I rented this movie is because I'm a big fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from the Early Edition). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him as in a different role (out of curiosity). Even the plot itself attracted me; an eager killer (Tony Greco, a certain Mr. Chandler) must kill a person at random before he is given life - or rather death - by a witness who testifies against someone in the "family". The films were not as I expected. He was sick, I hated the end (if you saw him, you would know why), and there were so many useless parts. Basically- it was dirty, and it made little sense. Yes, it was a movie for the mafia, and yes the guns do BOOM. But there's more to a movie than that. This film worked as if it didn't have time to go into details, just face it and understand it. The acting really made up for it- James Belushi was pretty funny as "The Rose". Sheryl Lee made Angel look as credible as she could get. You surprised me more. And Kyle Chandler was equally convincing as a newcomer anxious for "the family". If only the script did justice to the actors.
