This is the biggest pile of shit I've ever seen. DON'T RENT! The creators of this film should be the band that never made another film. Start with a little plot, then quickly fade to nowhere. I think I'd rather look at painting as dry as I look at the cover. The actors were horrible, the plot faded quickly, the shooting left a lot of work to do. Not a good thing to say about this shitty movie. If you rent this movie, you will lose your money. I really like Lampoon's national films, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce and learn to direct. I feel I should sue these holes that made this film for money wasted on the cost of the rental and the time lost.
