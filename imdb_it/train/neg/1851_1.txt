A "friend", clearly without taste or class, suggested that I take a look at Ron Atkins' work. If this is representative of his work, I never want to see anything else from him. It's amateur, self-indulgent, criminally shoddy and self-indulgent. The title's "werewolf bitch" is an angry, low-budget filmmaker who kills a group of prostitutes. There is a bit of nudity and some erections, but no single element could save him from the hangman's noose. Enlightenment is terrifying, dialogue is childish and mostly screamed, and direction makes no sense. I saw a document on American filmmakers at the recent Fangoria convention. Atkins was one of those in the foreground. He spoke as if there was something important in his work, but after seeing this, I see nothing important. There is not even one style, and the horrible video effects (like solarization) do nothing but improve the amateur. Not even that bad is fun. To avoid.
