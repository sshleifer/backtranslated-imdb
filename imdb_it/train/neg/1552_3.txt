This film was very well advertised. I am a keen movie goer and have seen previews for this film for months. While I was a little skeptical about how funny this movie would be, my friends thought it would be great and urged me to talk about it. Then I went to see him, I was sunk in my almost sleeping place until I remembered that I had paid for this movie. I made myself laugh at most things in the film just to not feel bad and to destroy the good mood I was in, plus I wanted my money to come out of the movie! I always go to a movie with an open mind, not trying to get into them with too many expectations, but this film was not so funny. Now it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly worth waiting for HBO. If you haven't seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and mushy comedies, you can have fun, but for the real fans of the comedy Id say pass. Maybe even check out The Kings of Comedy again. Something told me to go and meet the parents instead !!!
