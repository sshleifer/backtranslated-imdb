I saw the movie recently and it looks a little like the book. I blame this poor script and direction. Some parts were introduced by force (the homosexual rape scene) for no apparent reason. Actually I read the book after seeing the film and about 20 years after reading it for the first time. I found it difficult to read and a little clumsy. Too many disparate ideas introduced without any benefit ... in addition to the sensational parts for the time. Being things that have been considered "sensitive", to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination it produced at that time. But it's not like that anymore or maybe I see things differently now or a little of both. The film tries too hard to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a mixture of scenes that can make sense for someone who has read the book. Even so this is a difficult film to watch and perhaps it should never have been made.
