A sexually obsessed chef leads a dual life: one as a "happily" man married to a ten-year-old boy, the other as a sexual demon. Most of the documentary film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a sexual therapist, listening to his story and investigating intelligently. The role of Nastassja is very restrictive and she is the only major adult character who does not take off his clothes. If he did, I would have classified this film as a very fat "F". As it stands, consider an F +, implying that it is still a failure unless someone likes to get bored. It is probably much more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that, once they have seen it, one wants one not to have seen it.
