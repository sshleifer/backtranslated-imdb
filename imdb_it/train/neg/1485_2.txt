For your sake, it would be better to ignore any positive reviews regarding this film. This tap STINKS. Now, I like (at least in theory) cheap horror movies, but that makes the worst mistake that a low budget movie can make: it takes itself too seriously. And unfortunately, it's not just a problem. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the deadly Beane clan of the British Ilses transposed to modern times. An interesting premise, but there are two things that are immediately a source of perplexity about this film, once you start watching it. <br /> <br /> # 1- Why is Jenna Jameson the biggest name on the CD package? She is a woman below the average who does not know how to act and has a secondary role. ANSWER: Apparently it is a well-known porn star (as you will no doubt read in other reviews), so I imagine this is a "cameo" appearance for her. It is giving the film the much needed "name recognition", apparently. His best billing is not indicative of his talent, however, it is an indication of how UNtalented the rest of the cast is. <br /> <br /> # 2 How can filmmakers be so stupid as to think that Canada can be passed as Ireland? Ireland doesn't even seem close enough. And the house where the guests / victims are located is this big Edwardian wooden North American style thing. They should have skipped the whole Beane theme and developed a story that took place in NA. Also, if you're planning to make a film set in Ireland, it's probably better to have more than one character with an Irish accent (and it was a real Irish accent.) Now, this wouldn't have been so bad if the director hadn't tried to make the next "Night of the Living Dead", but it seemed that it was. Sin. He could have had some fun. In fact, some scenes were not far from being unintentionally comical as they were. <br /> <br /> Like the infamous guttural scene, the woman is chained to the table, stripped naked, then cut into pieces and gutted. It's fun, you ask? Well, in the deleted scene version, the mutant killer pulls out miles after miles and miles of intestines. It's actually fun after a while. And which self-respecting cannibal if it eats the intestines, anyway? Do we eat the intestines of cows and chickens? Heck no, we eat hams and ribs and chopsticks. Oh good. <br /> <br /> Some of the other actors who were annoying: the plaintive, disturbing Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but I think he should have been chosen as a student. In fact, he is a big loser and an idiot as he would like his name. Which would explain why the character played by the cheerful Gillian Leigh fell for him. I checked Gillian Leigh on her IMDb link, and apparently it's important to know that she graduated with top grades. I can't decide if it's more fun or pathetic to know that just a couple of years after graduation, the honor student is doing soft-core porn scenes naked in a shower with a guy named Howard Rosenstein. I wonder if his former classmates saw this movie? If they have it, hopefully they will get the message: AVOID THIS DESTINY! GO TO COLLEGE !!! I could go on, but why. If you like blood, you will find something that redeems in this film, but not much more.
