Whoa nelly! I've heard a lot of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my hardcore horror critics found it really disappointing. The man was right on the nose! This film was played by true amateurs. They had to take only one shot, maybe two in each scene, the film seemed too fast. Even the script was poor ... they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. "Take your loves from me!" Oh man, I hate it when movies try to do it. It happens all the time with the comedies ... but, with a horror film and with below average actors ... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this film was, once again, the damn acting. It was terrible. Also from the little Asian boy who worked at the stand. I thought it was great. <br /> <br /> The film is about 5 stupid fools! Tourists who are on vacation in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a sex / slaughterhouse run by the Mafia. It looks like a good story. But watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the murder. There was no trace of suspense. <br /> <br /> I like many other horror fans who were dying to have their damned gloves. But unfortunately with a huge EN, the film was incredibly disappointing. I liked the ankle rupture and the effects of blood. Even the flaccid chickens were so-so. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is the first feature film by Ryan Nicholson, and for the most part it has failed. There is no denying that he has a sick sense of humor and a taste for horror. I pray your next movie won't sound like another B horror movie ... unless you tell us it's what it will be. Even after this disappointment, I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen of him, he's a real man dedicated to the genre. Good luck next time, because this was bad news.
