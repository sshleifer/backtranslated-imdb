I firmly believe that the best Oscar ceremony in recent years was in 2003 for two reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) The host Steve Martin was the smartest: "I saw the teamsters helping Michael Moore in the trunk of his limousine "and" I better not mention the gay mafia in case I wake up with a poodle's head in my bed "<br /> <br /> 2) Surprise winners: No one had Adrien Brody for the best actor (Genuine applause) or Roman Polanski for the best director (authentic boos and whistles) but they won <br /> <br /> Last year's award ceremony was not bad but there was little in terms of surprises and I was happy to see RETURN OF THE KING sweep the awards even though it wasn't the best of the trilogy (FELLOWSHIP was much better), but what left the BBC coverage was Jonathan Ross getting some of his fellow sofophantic rounds and pretending they were hilarious when they were nothing but. So when I heard that Sky was doing cover for British TV, I expected Barry Norman and Mark Kermode to be making links, but instead we ended up with Jamie Theakston and Sharon Osbourne! Oh gawd if British TV is desperate for film critics (of course they are) I'm sure both Bob The Moo and Theo Robertson will happily fly to Los Angeles to give their honest opinions on winners and losers <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was not bad, but he is not Steve Martin, while the location seemed to resemble a sports arena with seats placed inside! In my opinion it is not a very gorgeous arena. The main problem I had with the ceremony was the format with the "minor" Oscars given to the winners who were sitting in their seats! There is no Oscar "minor" and only because the prize is for Best Animated Short or Best Costume Design are deserved as Best Film or Best Director. All winners should be allowed to get on the podium. What kind of arrogant snobs the Academy is becoming and I quite agree with the comments that this format is shameful and if it wasn't for the surprises this could have been the worst ceremony in history. Regarding the same awards <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actress - Cate Blanchett. No big surprise for a competitive category <br /> <br /> Best Supporting Actor - Morgan Freeman. No real complaints since Freeman is one of the greatest actors of living characters in America <br /> <br /> Best Actor - Jamie Foxx. Most predictable prize of the night. Yawn <br /> <br /> Best Actress - Hilary Swank. Big surprise that everyone thought that Annette Benning would have won the academic policy, but Swank deserved it and gave the best speech of the night <br /> <br /> to Best Director - Clint Eastwood. Great surprise as everyone thought that Scorsese would get the prize simply because he had never won one. Actually I'm happy about this because if he didn't deserve it for TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS, he didn't deserve it for THE AVIATOR <br /> <br /> Best Film - MILLION DOLLAR OF THE CHILD. Another big surprise, since everyone thought that the academy would split prizes for the best director and best film while I thought the Hollywood story of THE AVIATOR would make a cert for the best film while the controversial topic of MDB would have turned a lot of voters who exclude <br /> <br /> What these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore the Oscar politics and really give prizes to people who deserve something they have not done in the past, I mean BEAUTIFUL MIND that beats THE FESTIVAL OF THE RING for the good of God! And for a long time the academy votes with its head instead of their heart
