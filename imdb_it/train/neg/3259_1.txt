Fantastically putrid. I do not mean to suggest that only a few people should avoid "Doc Savage". Almost every demographic group would be bored by this trivial film quality production. It's a bit like the "Batman" TV series of the 1960s, except it's not funny. Even accidentally, you're better off taking a nap.
