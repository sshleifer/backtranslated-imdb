I saw this piece of work at a film festival in California. My God, what was the director thinking? Filmmakers should use this film as a case study of what NOT to do when making a short film. First of all, this project makes absolutely no sense. The film takes place partly in "The Waystation", a stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere, where nothing really takes place. <br /> <br /> Acting goes beyond evil. So bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. Lead actress Julia Reading is a step below acting in most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent shows, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's as if the director had no idea how to work or use his actors. The only thing worse than acting was dialogue, which bordered on the absurd. The screenwriter (who I assume is also the director) writes each character as if they were rehearsing for a villain of the comic. <br /> <br /> The overall value of the production is quite good, but to be honest, with such a bad film it is easy to overlook it. The design of the production is quite good, even if the Waystation looks like a normal bar. The costumes and make-up are fine, and I understand that the production was working on a low budget. It is only when the characters talk, or try to push the plot forward, the film crumbles into a shit of shit. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is terrible. It's as if the director / screenwriter was watching a lot of science fiction films and throwing all the parts he liked into a blender and came out of it. My only hope is that he used the other people's money on this, because if he used his own, he is a real shit.
