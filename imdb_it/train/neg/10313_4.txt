This film was difficult to grasp and when I finally saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. I mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man exploits the unaware industry of the airline and walks away with millions of ransom dollars without hurting anyone or messing with the attempt. With all this interest incorporated, how can you make a film so oppressive and full of talk about this true life event. While Williams is always interesting, the writers assume that the D.B. The person of Cooper was stereotypically heroic as a movie star, s what we get is a type, without engaging details or insights into the mind of a person who is daring and intelligent enough to have pulled it out. Harrold practically steals the movie with his sperm and her pure beauty, but the real disappointment was in the management of the plot and the lame direction. Shame on this film to even exist.
