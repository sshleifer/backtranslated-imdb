Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring director, lives in a battered apartment in New York and relies on his mother to help make the rent. She has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not be married but who in Aldolpho would like to star in her film. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise to finance his film from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he did. That is, until Joe brings Al on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the film be made before Aldolpho is completely devoid of a moral backbone? And will Angelica be the protagonist of the film? This is, in the opinion of this viewer, a terrible film. The script is abysmal, with a plot that wanders willy-nilly. Beals practically snarls all his lines and Buscemi, even if funny, is anonymous. There is a lot of unpleasant material and unpleasant characters to boot. Finally, even the production values ​​are very scarce, making the film always in second place. If you have time, it's still a good idea not to risk this movie. But if you're the proverbial glutton for punishment, go ahead and look at that damn thing. Beals looks beautiful after all.
