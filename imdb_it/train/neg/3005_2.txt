Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic slasher movie of the 80s. A joke gets out of hand leaving a horribly burned geeky guy. A few years later, the geeky boy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him. Now the story might seem intriguing and very funny, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80s is that it has some nonsense flaws and errors of continuation. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrendous, however, in reality it is not as bad as one might suspect. Although it doesn't help that every character in the film is so narrow and unpredictable. The protagonist, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the easiest tormentor of all and she is the one who is supposedly sharing the compassion and the root for. Not to mention the fact that the geek is a bit too geeky and I think even the same stereotyped geeks would have been brutally exasperated and completely openly antagonized by how brilliant he is, so when he's caught, does anyone really care? <br /> <br /> There is a lot of potential for involuntary laughter. Munro's lack of acting talent is pretty obvious, which puts her on the same level as the rest of the horrible cast. However, the biggest fun is easily when the film tries to pose Munro, who was a teenager in the mid-thirties, in a cast of teenagers. And then when it comes to a later life and Munro is playing around his real age, the rest of the cast does not pass as an adult. All this goes well with a theme song that is an exhilarating pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by manic laughter and a screaming "I'll catch you" voice. That being said, Slaughter High is not really a great slasher movie, but it has a bad entertainment value. Perhaps an essential element for hardcore slasher fans, but don't expect any dilemma, suspense or credibility. Horrible!!!
