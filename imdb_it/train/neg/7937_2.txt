After 30 seconds, you realize that there was no real budget for this economic knock-off. The plot is taken from great films like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like those movies, even if they are well duplicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to watch: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is poor and the music is stupid and totally out of place. You don't care at all what happens to the characters. Even the so-called villains are not at all interesting and rather stereotyped. What about blood and blood? Well, there are some, even if it's quite cheap and the action is done very badly. 2 points, only for blood and blood but you understand that it is not worth a look, even for blood hunters.
