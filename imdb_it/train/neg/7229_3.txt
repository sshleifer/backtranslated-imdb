This film seems to start in the middle, introduces the peripheral players as if they were meaningful and presents main characters without any substance and very subtle and / or impenetrable subtitles. Hardly anyone has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film. The plot blazes up and eventually goes nowhere, the dialogue is clumsy and trivial and the director has few concepts on how to get the best from his actors. It almost seems like there is a first part of this film, but it has never been realized. <br /> <br /> We were told that a mysterious pyramid appeared in New York City and that Central Park inexplicably became an Arctic land. Yet none of these seem to have caused much fuss among the general population and is only a minor concern for the government. <br /> <br /> We are presented with the "evil society" in Eugenics but this is really just a convenient way to populate the universe with a couple of servants that trigger power. The whole double sense of "eugenics is bad" is heavy and never really peeps out here. We should worry about the central characters, but we never learn enough to know why. So much on this world is underdeveloped or completely underdeveloped that comes out as a fatalistic rationalization of 1 hour and 40 minutes for rape. <br /> <br /> In the "digitalized" world of digital animation created here, everything. I can say that more or less at the same time that this film was made, many other directors did the same thing with more uniform results. credible. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this movie, the most burning question left in my mind was, "So what?"
