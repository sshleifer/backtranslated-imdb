If you really enjoyed the 2002 Resident Evil movie, you should just watch it instead of waiting 2 hours for it to never come back. I can't believe anyone commented that this movie is just a cheap way to defeat RE. First, a "special" command force is the only defense for a structure with a computer matrix that has artificial intelligence and holographic projection. And this "Hive" set-up has a series of traps that inevitably kill one team member at a time. There is even a reference to chess in the code names, which was in the RE dialog box. Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the "Rook", the nemesis of the film, is a species of bio-creature, very coloring that suggests the necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a RE super mutant. So, a joke by Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming any credit for this story. <br /> <br /> Obviously I'm not the same film, but the writer had the idea of ​​seeing Resident Evil I think.
