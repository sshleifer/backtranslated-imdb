This film was the most Mormon film yet made. It made RM & Sons of Provo look like a good movie! It had to be fun from what I was told. The best part was the best actor in the film - Travis Eberhard - if it weren't in the film it probably wouldn't have been realized! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It wasn't fun 9. It was 8 beats. He had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character made no sense 7. He was made in Provo 6. He didn't tease Brokeback 5. He had Larry H. Miller in it 4. It was the first movie that Clint Howard wasn't funny in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2. They should have tried the Surreal Life 1 auditions. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
