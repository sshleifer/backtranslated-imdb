The main character Lance Barton is killed and in heaven before his time. When the sky learns of the error, he is given the body of the rich and old Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black man in an old white body who still behaves like the young black man is perhaps funny if you see it done by an old white actor. In this film I ended up remembering several times: "Chris Rock should be an old white man". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as expected: "The illusion" is not carried well and the love story is not at all credible. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock who plays a young black guy, because the old white that everyone should see is shown only in small scenes, it's a real challenge for viewers "suspension of disbelief".
