Ok, horror film about a beautiful suburban family that deals with the death of their parents and the "thing" in the basement that they continue to feed the people they collect on the street. Obviously there is more in that sense, but to say more would be to say. <br /> <br /> For me this didn't come together because it tries to make it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film. the film tries very hard to walk on the razor's edge between the two genders, but it seems to stumble everywhere as it tries to be shocking, something that it never really is. It doesn't help that the final revelation is less frightening than an "oh", as in "Oh, is it so?" Perhaps if I hadn't watched so many horror films recently, it would have been better or could have seemed just because I would never have compared it to so much. <br /> <br /> passage
