Probably this film was inspired by Godard's Masculin, f√©minin and I invite you to watch that movie. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements and those are: (1) the realistic acting (2) the impressive, undeservedly good, photo. Apart from that, what strikes me most is the endless stream of nonsense. Lena Nyman must be the most annoying actress in the world. He behaves so stupidly and with all the nudity in this film, ... he is not attractive. Compared to Godard's film, intellectuality has been replaced by stupidity. Without going too far on this subject, I would say that this derives from the difference of ideals between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> A film of its time and place. 2/10.
