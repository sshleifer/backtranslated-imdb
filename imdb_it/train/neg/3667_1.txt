The opening scene "explains" why Hurt is later "immune" to the "contaminated man". Too bad you don't explain anything else: how he got what he "captured" / what he was / why it works so fast. So let's go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was it opening in the past or in the future? It turns out that it's the past, of course, but for a moment it seems to be the first part of the film moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid more attention, eh? Or maybe it's just hurt. So much confusion about the different jobs he had in the related fields, and finally a mention of how he should have died of the original experiment that was done to him. Aha! So the industry and the private one got together to poison one of their best guys to see the effects? He must have been one of the best, he's a friend of the chemical company, for God's sake. Then there's the substance itself: technically a poison, but changes into immune "vectors", so we can have everything we want; a poison, an illness, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the courier. How convenient. Then there is the protocol h a z m a: they jump into a situation without having an idea of ​​what's in store or how to prepare. Didn't the producers have enough money to show a proper rinse after the crew had just left the scene of an unknown deadly substance? I kept thinking that Hurt would die from a bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would prove to be the closest, after all.
