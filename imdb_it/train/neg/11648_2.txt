As if there were not enough of those that are already running at that moment, we have here another clone of GODFATHER lame from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) that I had seen earlier this year. The name of a golf tent at this time is Telly Savalas who comes late in the proceedings and is seen for the first time from behind, tending rather to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! In addition to not seeming the least Sicilian, he has no accent whatsoever except his familiar accent. Antonio Sabato, therefore, represents an unlikely gangster - besides being a resistible frontman; his relationship with Savalas, who becomes paternal in the blink of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he later becomes romantically involved with her teenage niece)! Also, for a gangster movie, there is a small and valuable action to talk about and none of them is in any way memorable (although the final set in a clinic is handled quite well); moreover, the soundtrack by Francesco De Masi is useful but nothing else. Incidentally, the DVD of the basement I rented starts in the middle of the titles so that none of the cast members - or even the movie title - is ever listed!
