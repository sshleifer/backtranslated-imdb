Watching this movie is like eating a feast of nothing but meringues. Initially it looks great but in the end it offers NO satisfaction - no one. <br /> <br /> The plot is a messy mess about a toy factory and the forces of evil. So, how is it possible that with this basic AND Robin Williams plot the film is still so bad ?! It is because the image is all appearance without any substance - very similar to the terrible image of Popeye that Williams made at the beginning of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but perhaps there is not enough money to hire writers who have graduated. <br /> <br /> The film is a funny little joke that goes on and on and on and on. I'm not sure why it was created in the first place - it certainly wasn't created to provide any kind of entertainment.
