If you want to spend almost 2 hours of your life watching this depends on how you like your horror movies. If you like them so damn horrible they are hysterical, look away. Jigsaw is without doubt the worst movie I've seen in my life (and I've seen "Long Time Dead"), and I say this as a fan of the low budget horror / goreo genre and having seen some to compare it to I'm not going to enter specifically what makes this movie so ugly, the only positive thing is that it's so terrible that it's one of the funniest things I've seen in years. If you can find this cheap rent it is definitely worth looking at, if you were involved in doing so - pity for you. : o) IMDb needs to introduce a 0/10 ranking in particular for this film, it fully deserves it.
