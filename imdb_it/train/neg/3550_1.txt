I manage a group to stop the exploitation of comedians and I spent the last 2 months listening to horror stories from comedians who tried to audition for "Last Comic Standing". If they don't have a good agent, then they don't even have the chance to audition, so more than 80% of the comedians who appear are rejected before they can show someone they have talent! If they do it for an audition, I've been told it's "predetermined" if they get a second chance. So what the TV audience sees is NOT the best comic in the United States. <br /> <br /> If comics do it at the show, then many of them don't get IMDb credits. I know because I made the credits for all 6 seasons of "Last Comic Standing" and I'm not paid for the work of the Producers. It's really a shame. A month ago, I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook why the producers weren't giving credits to IMDb and I was banned from their Facebook page !!! I'm not a comedian so I don't have a personal interest in this. I just want people to know the truth. I don't like to see ANYONE being exploited and that's why I helped the comedians. The comedians are exploited on HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC is a BIG TRE network, so managers should be ashamed of themselves to allow exploitation. <br /> <br /> Watch this video of a victimized comedian: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
