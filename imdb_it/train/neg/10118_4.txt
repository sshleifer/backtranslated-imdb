Acclaimed director Mervyn LeRoy stages a drama that rivals the best of soap operas. The high drama is found in the loves and infidelities of the New York social set. Oh yes, don't forget that jealousy can cause contaminated hearts and murders. The cast features of all the stars: Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin, James Mason, Ava Gardner, Cyd Charisse and Nancy Davis.
