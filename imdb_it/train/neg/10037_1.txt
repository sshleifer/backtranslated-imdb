I never thought that the standard of Yashraj movies would ever get so bad! The film has a meaningless plot that has no interest. <br /> <br /> Saif has acted more. Kareena has improved her figure, but she is not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. I can say that the role was not good .. <br /> <br /> A great deal of convenience was introduced. I wondered if it was thought to be the "comic part" of the film. Just because the latest films were flops, does that mean Yashraj's films should do this kind of garbage? It has a history of many good films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the film.
