I remember seeing the film in the summer of '78 with my parents, and being quite involved at the time. Of course, I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before Jackson's films came out, my wife and I rented this movie since he had never seen it and I felt nostalgic. <br /> <br /> Ralph Bakshi finished the money halfway through the animation process for this film, and was forced to drastically cut the corners of this production. Since this film was made mainly with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a limited budget, this is saying something. Much of this film is an animation only in the loosest sense of the word. There are some scenes that are very obviously only people standing in front of a screen, with perhaps some animation effects superimposed on them. <br /> <br /> Due to budget constraints, the film - already a squeeze of "La Compagnia degli Anelli" and part of "Le due torri" - has been reduced even more. What you get is a bit like a film version of Cliff's book notes. <br /> <br /> It is not so bad, however, the animation brings a warmth to it, which I found lacking in the Jackson film. It's nice to imagine what it would have been like with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This film is also noteworthy for having the sequel that never arrived. Several years later, a half-hour unconvinced television special was aired that should have wrapped things up. All I will say is that it was a musical.
