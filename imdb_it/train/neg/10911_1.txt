I hated this movie so much that I remember it vividly. It's not even funny. Any film that relies on humorous sexual jokes and racist humor does not deserve the money it costs to do so. In the first half hour Rob Schneider drinks a rancid milk carton. All I could think was "he deserves it, to make such a bad film". Don't waste time or money with this.
