(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian TV even if shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the previous DEMONS films. It had to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which was made by director Lamberto Bava. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurrent dreams of herself as a child who descends into the old cellar of this villa and encounters this structure similar to a cocoon hanging from the ceiling. It lights up and is covered with cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging from it. Drip what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Obviously the husband doesn't believe any of this. The villa is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and you should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like a sixteenth-century costume with a wolf's head attached to it and is attracted by the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> The films are not so bad and at least the dialogue is halfway smart without the ridiculous embarrassing phrases that dubbing would bring. There is no other blood than other skeletons that rot in a pond in the basement that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself vanishes simply after being run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of Shriek's DVD I saw was defective, with the image that for a few seconds turned black for about half an hour in the film, a flaw that I hope Shriek has corrected since then. The extras include a brief interview with Lamberto Bava in which he explains how it was not a sequel, etc ... etc ... along with some trailers of other Shriek DVD releases. These are fairly standard things. <br /> <br /> 3 on 10 <br /> <br />
