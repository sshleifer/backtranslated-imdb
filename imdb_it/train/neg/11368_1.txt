This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist rather than a Muslim conspiracy. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> Does anyone go to journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshwater rhetoric of the year? These alarmist assertions, presented in a pleasant way, could prove to be persuasive. But by not offering any recognition of possible opposing arguments, nor viable (or at all) solutions, few sources and each of dubious origin, make the argument an ineffective diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank God for this - I wouldn't want anyone leaving the theater BELIEVING any of these racist comments. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and I hope a precautionary story for you - to actually read a movie before seeing it.
