SOME SPOILERS NOT SO-SPOILY IN ADVANCE <br /> <br /> Why do people, when they are disoriented, sick or scared in a club, cut in the middle of the crowded dance floor while they go to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone enters their room? <br /> <br /> How many times you knock on the door of a stranger and when they do not answer IMMEDIATELY, open the door, enter, shout a few good-byes and then start crossing their things? <br /> <br /> If you were chased by someone you just found out to be a killer, what would you do? Quietly sneak away and hide under a wooden platform or between metal tools? Are you running, silently, in an old barn or in another decrepit structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost all the thrillers released in recent years, but since this is the "The Return" page, of course I'm talking about "The Return". I saw it for free because I work in a movie theater and I make a point of projection of all the "scary" films. I thought this was tolerable ... apart from the well-worn clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really gray and looks like "Huh?" through most of the film. The plot details are given slowly as the film progresses and it is almost enough to make it interesting, except that there was not enough explanation as it moved and therefore I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it. <Br /> <br /> If you're a keen thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to see a movie, eh, I guess it's worth a matinee ticket. If you thought the trailer made it look interesting and you can't wait ... wait.
