This film was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and Critters for hardcore. Like many of the critters / trolls / gremlins movies of the 80s this film is bad. The sad part is that there is no end to that comment. It's just ugly and not in a fun way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature movie is that it actually tries to be fun and ends up being successful in doing that as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other horror films of the 1980s classic was that they sincerely tried to scare, but they were hilarious because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for comedy before she started directing this film. Unfortunately they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course seeing a strange mutant crossed between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trench coat and throwing billiard balls at an outcast from the Lost Boys is fun, but not enough to save the film. <br /> <br /> By far the most annoying part of the film is the character of Paul. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough for you to start fast forwarding from the moment of his first scene until the credits stop just once to see a scene where a munchie throws billiard balls at a guy ... .not that he did it. <br /> <br /> So the bottom line is to run, don't walk, to your nearest Blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thank him for not having the grapes to store this pile of garbage on the shelves.
