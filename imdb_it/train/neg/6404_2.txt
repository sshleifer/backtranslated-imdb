Spoiler ... if such a thing is possible ... . . . . . Being an avid fan of Robin Williams, I felt it necessary to buy this film as a first appearance on the screen. Wow ... I could not imagine a more shocking film. Basically, the film takes a bad joke after another that your Uncle Artie would tell you after dinner and dramatize them. Robin Williams plays a lawyer in a 30-second skit. They are all for obscene humor, but this humor was not pleasantly vulgar, or ribald ... it was just for the mind. There are no redeeming qualities for this film, apart from Robin Williams fans, like me, who simply have to own every movie.
