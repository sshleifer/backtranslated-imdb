This is probably the best horror movie made since Ed Wood died. <br /> <br /> I can't ruin the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll do my best, though. There are some types of lesbian vampires, but they continue to swap bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you are supposed to be, or it could be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Confused sound? It's not as confusing as one might think, since none of the characters makes sense to begin with. There is no plot, no development of characters and casual people appear, they speak a few lines and then disappear, not to be heard anymore. There are also zombies, which are * possibly * enemies of vampires, but there is also a kind of dream sequence inside a dream in a psychiatric hospital, so maybe none of this happened, and it's all the hallucination of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> The bright side? Both main girls take off their shirts briefly. The special effects are simply stunning (I particularly liked the incredibly slow and awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /> <br /> It is worth the rental price. We laughed until we cried.
