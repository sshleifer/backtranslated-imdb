Alan Alda plays the "Sports Illustrated" writer in real life, George Plimpton, who was invited to join the Detroit Lions football team as an honorary member. A rather dark and unpleasant drama, curiously tempered by fantasy. The director Alex March takes an interesting note on this material, shooting it in an almost documentary way (with macho comments) and giving the story a touch of whimsical fantasy; however, by bringing out the cinematic showiness of this set-up, it transforms the main narrative into a jumble. Alda's smug and hilarious performance is another handicap, even though the supporting cast is full of real-life pro-athletes (and sparkling Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - how come a fantasy?) * 1/2 from ****
