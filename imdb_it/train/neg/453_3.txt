Ok, first the beauty: the Cher performance and the cinematography. Even though I'm not a Cher fan, he gives an excellent performance and his part was well written. Cinematography has been well done and captures a sense of romance. <br /> <br /> The Rest: a subtle plot, the performance of Nicholas Cage and a totally non-humorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York. First, every time Cage opened his mouth, I shivered. I don't know what kind of accent he was trying to use. Honestly no, it was certainly not a New York or Italian accent I have ever heard. It was rather surreal. And it's not because I'm a little bit angry to be precise, his voice has just slipped into my ears. And I like Nicholas Cage in other shows. Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relationships, friends and acquaintances in New York City and frankly I had more laughter and I felt more joy in appreciating the Italian ethnic family by far than this film. And that would be a boring night at home. What a disappointment.
