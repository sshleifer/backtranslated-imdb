First and foremost, I completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this "parody". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally presented the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He worked on the film for years and is the first of a trilogy he wanted. "What is that?" is Crispin Glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes from Herzog, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I heard rumors of this movie years ago "epic porn movie with all the cast of the crunchy glover direct bass syndrome". When it finally came out, I watched the trailer online and read the synopsis and got my mouth foaming with anxiety. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a big disappointment. If he pulled out the fool sh * t, like his smoking grandmother and dancing dolls, he would be left with something much better, but only for about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> In other words, just watch the trailer, be entertained and forget it. There are some amazing images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases, but his lack of concentration is tantamount to disappointment.
