After finishing watching this movie I was so upset that I had lost 2 hours of my life. I haven't been back for two hours. Ugh. When you start this you might think "Wow, this is really good!" But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING. I was so excited about this movie until the stupidest ending I've ever seen. This film is simply pathetic. The acting is insignificant, the plot is anything but original and there is nothing particularly unique about it, except that it is the worst movie ever seen !!! DON'T LOOK AT THIS FILM !!! WARNING!! DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU ARE SORRY IF YOU HAVE WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS !!! 1/10
