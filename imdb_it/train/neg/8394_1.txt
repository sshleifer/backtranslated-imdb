Apparently this is a Z-quality DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have, many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading that book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You made your way here, now you can go out again!" (after leading a man to the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they sing) <br /> <br /> - it is not clear what this film is, made in the era known for the post - structuralism, it's actually about, or if it's just bad film making. The acting is atrocious, but some actors I know, so are they kidding? <br /> <br /> An old house, obviously cut with a contemporary home, is the site of the murders. A film (bad) is made in the ground and the story is repeated again.
