I was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to watch Steve's video. It was a nice experience ... in film propaganda and boredom. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the film could be a real documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal and edgy effort to slam the conservatives and the local religious community. It seems certain that a filmmaker can make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions about the themes. <br /> <br /> The most surprising thing is to see all the votes of the "10" that his homeys have posted here. Have they even seen the video? Golly Gee Batman, this must be classified as All The President's Men! Their assessments are as obvious as the prejudice in this film. <br /> <br /> Yes, how to stack IMDb votes will help a lame movie. Perhaps my vote will help balance this out.
