This film is for the story of F.B.I. as Knott's Berry Farm is for the old west. Shamefully disinfected version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation against Crime. Hoover's heavy hand (had any other kind?) Shows all the actors reading quality script, cheese sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart at 20% of dramatic ability, Vera Miles chews the landscape, the film presents every c-lister known in the mid-fifties with a touch of irony or humor, from the "Amazon jungle" to the "barbecue on the back", everything has the flavor of sound boxes and backs. Firearms are also canned and familiar. I guess Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting outsiders who set up shots, nothing here stands out beyond a curiosity.
