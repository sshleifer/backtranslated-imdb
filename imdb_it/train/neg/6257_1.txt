SPOILER. Strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this film. Let me add balance by pointing out the following: <br /> <br /> Script: terrible. While Tom and Dan are "getting to know", discussing films, the speech is clearly that of a person, and I suspect that it was the director, who worked his words carefully to seem intelligent. At one point, Dan asks, "Have you ever heard of the HIV virus?" and it seems as natural as asking: "Have you communicated with the nine alien races?" <br /> <br /> Acting: white teeth and a chiseled face do not make a sensitive artist. Speedman did quite well with what he was given, I suppose, but Marsden was terrible: unpleasant, unbelievable and decidedly smug and affectionate throughout his imprisonment. There is a void in his performances (see also Interstate 60). <br /> <br /> Plot: Save Me! The moments of half-escape were not exciting but irritating and weak. He calls Marsden pretending to try the keys in the door and then throwing them down: "They don't work, man!" Tee-hee. And watch out for semi-white and black flashbacks, which started with a schocky sound taken from CSI and other detective movies. <br /> <br /> The most important of all, the most dangerous, the evil and the offensive, is homophobia (external or internal, you decide) in a film in which HIV is considered a weapon . Tom says that Dan could have removed the condom or not used it at all - excuse me, where was Tom while they were having sex? There is some wickedness of the advertiser partner who comes out as a rascal of the gay man in general. <br /> <br /> In summary: Attention!
