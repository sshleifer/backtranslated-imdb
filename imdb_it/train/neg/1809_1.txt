There is nothing I hate more than pretentious self-congratulation. Kevin Smith deserves to be hung on his toenails for having inspired every whiner of the white middle class to make a film about why they can't fuck. I don't care about inexperience and low budget productions, but when writing is so obvious and cloying it really burns my potatoes. The money invested in this could have gone to a real filmmaker who really has a chance like John Gulager. If you look at Project Greenlight, you will immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anyone could take a camera and take a loquacious photo that can't really say anything. When will we be saved by the Smithonites and the Whedonettes of the world? The revolution cannot come soon enough. Watch a real first try by buying Desperado or looking for Friends with advantages. Thank you and good day.
