Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It looked promising. It went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to do, even from Angelina. He is about 20 years old and plays at 16. There are three characters that should be Italian. All the others are Italian-Americans. The Italian native accents were good, I thought. The young male protagonist is nice, my wife says. All the others in this film are a fat Italian woman. Even the men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a rude doctor, that was a bad sign. The two couples chasing their children are like the four Italian brats. <br /> <br /> My wife didn't want to let go of the remote. I hope you're not taking makeup, clothes or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of horrible and flashy. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Cutting my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie shows up on your TV, do yourself a favor and point your head on the TV screen. You'll be glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Mortal Friend".
