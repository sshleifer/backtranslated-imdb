I have to admit that I didn't give this film many possibilities. I decided early enough that this was not my kind of movie. <br /> <br /> For the most part, it looks excellent in terms of cinematography. The scenes of the early 1970s in Manhattan are very beautiful, as is the leading actress. It is a very sharp black and white, which could almost make the film look dated and fresh. However, some of the other techniques that filmmakers employ shoot at a perspective that goes to hell. The rambling montage is VERY late 1960s, halfway between surrealism and new wave. History seems to come from a precise moment, halfway between the idealism of free love and artistic experimentation. <br /> <br /> The film follows a girl around the city looking for a man with an anonymous sex phone with While he meets other strange characters, he reveals his oddities and reveals them. The film seems to be interpreted as an irreverent and irreverent comedy, but adds an avant-garde touch. I would expect that if you like Andy Warhol films, you would be very happy to discover The Telephone Book. <br /> <br /> Some problems I had: towards the end of the film, a character tells a wandering anecdote that lasts more than twelve minutes ?? - brutal to sit on. Furthermore, there is a very explicit animation sequence that I found to be gross and youthful that serves as the climax of the film. I laughed out loud four or five times, and I liked the finish (minus the disgusting and flat animation). And when the movie turned to color for the stand-by-night phone sequence, I actually liked the way it looked even better. It ended up being one of those experiences where I felt that I could really appreciate it if it was a little different. But this is what the directors gave us. It is obscure, artistic and very distant from the quadrant, but none of these is a reason to recommend it to yourself. I didn't find it as unique or creative as it was forced and pretentious.
