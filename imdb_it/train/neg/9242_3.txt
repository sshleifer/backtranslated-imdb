What a fantastic premise: a film on the Berlin airlift. It should have everything. Tragedy. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and tears. What we have is a film with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so, but fails miserably. It behaves in this way in wood, which at any time should collapse. Try to be tough instead of being tough! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Why were they throwing stones into a lake? Why does he bring his coal bricks? SFXs are very, very well made. Too much though. Do the hundreds of planes over Berlin look like a fighter-attack-formation squadron rather than an organized airlift ?? as it actually was. It is interesting to note that the White House, the Kremlin and the office of General Lucius D. Clays all seem to be the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same curtains, hanging at the bottom of the windows, as if they were a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why are almost all the scenes dark and dusty? By the way, General LUCIUS D. CLAY, looks like a small time, an insecure and loose general, who trusts his noble idea of ​​the airlift. It was very the opposite. So you combine all those personal mistakes and the result is a film that is based on no passion, without suspense and without historical accuracy. Sad, did it start so promising ??
