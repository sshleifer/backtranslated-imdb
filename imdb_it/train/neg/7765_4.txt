Strange, almost all reviewers are very positive about this film. Is it because of 1975 and Chamberlain and Curtis are there and therefore forgive the atrocious and bad ways of storytelling? <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because some people become sentimental about this movie because they read the book? (I didn't read the book, but I don't think it's a problem, the directors never assume that viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I'm subconsciously irritated by the fact that English-speaking actors try to behave like their French colleagues?
