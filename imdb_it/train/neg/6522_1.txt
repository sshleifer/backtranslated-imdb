This is not a commentary on the current film, but on the DVD version of RUSCICO for North America. I don't know if there have been several releases and updates, but the discs we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. However, the mixing of these DVDs was absolutely horrible. Levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene turned into a landscape on the battlefield, the orchestral track would have jumped so hard that I didn't know it would explode sooner - my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for the dialog box, the volume is usually reduced to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley's work remained noisy while the dialogue was superimposed on a much lower level. My wife and I discovered that the only way we could watch this movie from these DVDs was if one of us was holding a hand on the remote to continually adjust the volume. And, as another user has already commented, when we selected audio in English, the dialog box kept moving back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you don't understand either of them. In the end, we gave up looking after the first record. Before shelling out $ 50 + for this DVD movie for your library, I highly recommend that you get your hands on a hired copy to see if you can really enjoy this epic movie when weighed down by such a bad sound, particularly if you have not never read the book and really want to understand the plot.
