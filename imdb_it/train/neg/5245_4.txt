I am a current A.S.L. Student and was forced to watch this film in class, and what I got was the obvious prejudice involved in the film. The film is obviously supported by P.O.V. their "common perception of the deaf" is not something in between. Furthermore, the film did not mention or take into consideration other situations that are also under discussion in this topic. OSSIA Deaf people who were born by listening and later became deaf. Is that right or wrong in that case? The film is biased and practically everything according to the opinion of the deaf with a capital "D". Not that this is bad, but to be a real documentary film you need to try to be slightly impartial.
