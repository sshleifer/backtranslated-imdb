I rented this film because it falls within the genres of "romanticism" and "western" with some landscapes of the Grand Canyon. But if you're expecting a typical romantic western, forget it. This film is pure garbage! The love story is between a GIRL who has not even passed puberty and a MAN OF MIDDLE AGES! The child is also coveted by other malicious men. That's disgusting. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as a virtuoso trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and his character is mainly the one who pursues the relationship. At first he tries to chase it away, but in the end he gives up and they leave as a happy and loving couple. That's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this film can please anyone but pedophiles.
