Viewers who spout on everything including the title sequence (now THAT it's fun) would have us believe that it's a sort of cinematic miracle, but, trust me, people, this is one of the most embarrassing movies you can ever see, and if you? Not laughing at this five minutes, I would say that you have lost your sense of humor. <br /> <br /> David Niven plays a convicted and bold RAF pilot who somehow considers it appropriate to attract an impressionable (female) air traffic controller into an emotional conversation about love, just as he is rushing towards his death certain and fiery. (It's not romantic ...) Of course, it is spared from a metaphysical strangeness, and it washes itself on the beach, just as the flight controller himself is riding on his bicycle. (They are reiterated immediately). <br /> <br /> Looking beyond the bizarre homoerotic subtexts, (so over the top you must really refer to them as supertesti, from a naked boy sitting with bare legs in the sand playing the twilight-zone-esquire theme of the film on his little flute, to a celestial courier so campy / queen-y his makeup is encrusted more deeply than that of women '), the most bizarre aspects of the film are like weaving such bad caricatures of national and racial stereotypes into a twisted attempt to discuss some kind of point about universal nature and the power of love. We understand: guys like girls fly with skirts and heels, and girls like them, and, apparently, all you have to do is cry a little to make it noble enough to get your 10-star movie on IMDb. . <br /> <br /> As for the quality of production, continuity / modification is scarce enough to induce cringing, and lighting is, perhaps, even worse than that, but you don't have time to notice why the screenplay is so bad There are games played with Technicolor, (whatever goes through paradise is in black and white if you can make sense of it), and foreshadowing, (so my audience partner who loves movies like this actually applauded and laughed when the doctor's motorcycle eventually ended up in a fiery wreck), and freeze-motion, (which is the most fun of all because the female protagonist is so poor as to be firm in knowing that the hands of the stage faded from the camera). <br /> <br /> The best shots are the first on the beach, but then it's all downhill. The ladder (which moves like an escalator is moving) is barely the Odessa stairway, and I would really say that no one would feel as if they were witnessing this lame attempt to create films on their account. The film as a whole is bad enough to be funny, and that's the best thing I can say for it.
