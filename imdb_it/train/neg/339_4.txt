Unlike "The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai", or "Big Trouble in Little China", or "Conan the Barbarian", which are horrible films that have a certain coldness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is simply bad. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is not impractical, and there are some funny moments. But here the "flip attitude" attitude of Eddy Murphy simply distracts any feeling of tension or danger in history. And the special effects are foolish enough to do more damage to that tension. The "mystical secrets" of Tibetan Buddhism are sucked in rather than attracted to force them. Without the feeling that something is at stake, or that the characters are facing a real danger, why should we worry? br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - the big Eddy Murphy fans who can't help themselves? <br /> <br /> - I can't think of anyone else <br /> <br /> I'll give this movie a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked.
