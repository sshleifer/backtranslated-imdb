I noticed that the previous reviewer (who seems to still be at school) gave this film a very good review and I can only assume that this is due to the fact that the reviewer didn't see the much higher BBC adaptation of 1989 than this classic novel. The biggest problem I had with this version (1999) was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented guy who achieved fame after appearing in the TV miniseries "The Choir". I can only assume that he was chosen for the role of Tom Long thanks to his excellent performance in "The Choir". Unfortunately the boy who appeared in "The Choir" had grown up in a high-gangly youth for the moment when "Tom's Midnight Garden" was filmed and as such Anthony cannot convince as the schoolboy Tom. The imagination is too far off to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) would become friends with the younger Hatty. In the 1989 BBC version, Tom and Hatty are much closer and the development of their friendship is much more credible. For a 1999 film, even the special effects fail to convince and are not a clear improvement on the 1989 TV effects. The cast and the acting of this version are inferior to the previous adaptation and all in all the film was a non-glossy version of a true classic. As a final remark, I would like to point out that the 1989 BBC version VHS goes over £ 20.00 second hand while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for less than £ 5.00, should I add anything else?
