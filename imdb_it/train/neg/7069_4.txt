When the film was released it was the biggest hit and soon it became the Blockbuster. But honestly the film is a ridiculous clock with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has a tag line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara" which means sweet love but sacrifice is immortal. In the film the hero of the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the protagonist (Pooja Gandhi) even though the two loved each other! Its justification is the meaning of the tag-line. This film has influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this "Loser-like Sacrificial" attitude very attentive and therefore became the cult movie that they are, when they could have gone on with their lives. Ganesh's acting in the film is stupid amateur, crass and childish. It sounds really funny in a song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) when it should look elegant and fashionable. Even his appearance does not help the main role. His hair style is badly done in most of the film. ACT OF GANDHI CANT OF POOJA. His costumes are horrendous in the film and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The good part of the film is the excellent cinematography and brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which are actually the saving grace of the film. Jayant Kaikini's lyrics are also very well written. The director Yograj Bhat must be praised in retouching the songs in a refined way. <br /> <br /> However, all in all, except for the songs, the film is very ordinary !!!!!!
