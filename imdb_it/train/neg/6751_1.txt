My boyfriend and I rented it because we thought it could be a good "Halloween" take-off. A murderer who terrorizes young people, a white mask ... get my direction. We were completely wrong! No pun intended. We have not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! It's full of weft holes and doesn't make sense. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's all. I give credit for the fact that it was shot on a VERY low budget - I always support such films. Only not this particular. <br /> <br /> This movie can be nice to see if you are drunk or too tall; otherwise don't worry. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
