As someone who likes hunting scenes and who has really been fascinated by this fascinating real story, I was optimistic about this film but too many obstacles hampered the good story that should have been. <br /> <br /> THE BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he played, but his role here is boring as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is tasteless and the beautiful Kathryn Harrold is a real rubbish. From what I've read, there have been several directors who have replaced each other in this film, and that's a shame. You can say that things are not correct with the story. I couldn't even be "involved" with Cooper's portrait of Cooper Williams. He should have been charming, but he wasn't in this movie. It's also a bit sad to note that a guy who commits a crime is a kind of "folk hero", but I admit I ended up rooting for the boy. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can't complain about the scenery, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the Arizona desert. I'd like to see this film redone and done better, because it's a unique story of its kind.
