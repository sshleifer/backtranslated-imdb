I will keep this brief, as I know I need not say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little film that someone obviously likes, but I've found that it's incredibly bland from almost the beginning. The film has done little to make any character nice and the story has sometimes become so complicated that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know that others had fun, but I found Kitamura's "Alive" to be everything except - a lame drama, extremely boring, disguised as a stimulating sci-fi action movie. I felt like I was sucked into watching this movie, based on its intriguing premise and superb cover. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Switch to Kitamura for the more pleasant freshman effort of "Versus" or his 2004 revolt "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> ... And don't get me wrong, I'm always ready for a film of a man of good thought, but it certainly wasn't. There was not a moment when I really cared about a single event that took place in this excessively verbose and dialogue-filled film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
