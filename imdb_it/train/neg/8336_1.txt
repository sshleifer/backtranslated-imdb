How the hell did they do this ?! Presenting itself as a caper comedy, the "$" deception is essentially two hours of people muttering fragments of sentences. The usual reliable Warren Beatty looks drunk, and the usual funny Goldie Hawn behaves as if she's depressed. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the boy with the LSD champagne bottle can save this useless litany. <br /> <br /> Am I comparing this film with "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? I wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was made in an idiotic way but ended up being hilarious; this was done in an idiotic way and makes you feel like your brain just melted from your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn made up for it when they starred in "Shampoo", but then starred in the terrible "Town & Country". Maybe they shouldn't be acting in movies. All in all, I'd rather tear off my skin than look at it again. Awful. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should do it again with Jackie Chan. So I would pay to see it.
