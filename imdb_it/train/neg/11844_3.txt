Anyone who is a fanatic of the 1920s jazz, the 1920s dress, the Charleston and ultra-swanky yachts (eg I, on all fronts) will want to appreciate this film. But the sad fact is that it is all there is. The plot is trivial and obvious, the acting is mostly horrible or played on the farcical side of events, and when the whole thing is over there is little left but the impression of mirrors and smoke. This is a bad movie well done.
