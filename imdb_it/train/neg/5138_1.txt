I saw the SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it. Well, I can't imagine anyone like this movie because it's just bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that anyone who made this film does not know a single thing about horror. The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres: action movies (guns and criminals) and horror (scarecrow living). When the criminals are killed one by one by the stinking scarecrows, the two genders automatically cancel because, first, they are criminals and those who care about criminals, and second, because they are stupid criminals! Having scarecrow zombies haunt them doesn't work right here. Where's the horror in this? I wanted the criminals to die horribly and painfully. <br /> <br /> But the story was built so badly that this marriage of genres, which could have been original if well managed, would NEVER freeze. There remains simply a bunch of super-dense criminals and a lot of scarecrows, who are "alive" for any inconsistent reason thought by the filmmakers. To make things even worse is the fact that cinematography is terrible (as on TV) and, worse off than everything, groups of dialogues are told to the CBs, and we continually listen to disconnected dialogues on disconnected images as if we were looking at something sort of radio show. This part was really BAD. The director should have been shot on the spot to get such a stupid idea! I can't tell you how annoying it was. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, SCARECROWS criminals are incredibly stupid. For example, when someone suddenly shows up, gutted and full of money and straw (yes, straw) in his huge open wound, the others ask "What drug is he?" after firing tons of bullets into him, unable to kill him (he was "zombiefied" by the scarecrows.) Don't ask ...). Get a crazy clue, you idiots. I've never seen such stupid people in a movie. And then there's the girl. I was hoping one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a nuisance. When he finds his father pinned to a scarecrow "cross," he actually blames criminals in an embarrassing (bad acting) scene, even though the criminals couldn't have done it. What an idiot it was! But scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak movie. They are not scary. Not much is explained about them. I'm just a plot device in this movie full of devices. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wesley, filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds without interruption, raises nothing but boredom. And that scene with the talking head in the fridge. Thanks for the laughs. <br /> <br /> All in all, this was supposed to be one of the worst movies I've seen recently (and I've seen a lot of movies these days!) Between the equally painful KILLER or SCARECROWS SILO, I'd rather look at SILO KILLER again. Yes, SCARECROWS are so bad.
