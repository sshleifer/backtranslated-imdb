The female lead was a terrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. He was smiling too much when he first went in front of the cameras to talk about his daughter. This should have forced the police to suspect it. I would have been inconsolable in the same situation. She seemed very calm for a mother who couldn't find her daughter. It was as if he didn't even want to be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played the best part. And he would have earned much more money on such a controversial and important topic. All the others were excellent. I don't know where the leading actress is, but I hope she received some acting lessons.
