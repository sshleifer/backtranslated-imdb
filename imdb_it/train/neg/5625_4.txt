Jack London's life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films on different aspects of him. Sad to say, however, that his life was used in the film to make wartime propaganda that gave the best face to some of the less attractive parts of his character. <br /> <br /> Jack London who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around. He wrote about what he knew, but he also wrote like everyone else bringing with him the baggage of his own life experience. Some of those experiences on another day and time would have been condemned as racism. But this was the second world war and London was a great supporter of the "yellow danger" as it was called in the past. <br /> <br /> Two thirds of the film covers his life as an author, we see his years as a sailor from which he took inspiration for The Sea Wolf. We see him in the Yukon in a miner's cabin with a dog that was undoubtedly his inspiration for The Call of the Wild. London was able to capture the spirit of adventure that its very life was all about the right card for the world to enjoy since then. <br /> <br /> The last third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the Russian-Japanese War. London was socialist, but its socialism did not include oriental people. Like a few million others, he saw the growing immigration of Chinese and Japanese to our Pacific coast as a threat to work for whites. He supported strict immigration policies for the Orientals. <br /> <br /> The film puts the cart before the horse. London is presented as a man who saw why Japan's ambitions were available in the Russian-Japanese war and for this reason it was xenophobic like him. In reality the kind of atrocities present in the Second World War did not exist during the Russian-Japanese conflict. Japan had its imperial ambitions, but so were all the others, including the United States at the time. But our immigration policies caused by the pressures of our West Coast politicians have contributed decisively to the deterioration of relations with Japan within a couple of generations. London was part of the cause, not a prophet who was crying in the desert. <br /> <br /> This film was the first independent production of Samuel Bronston who later made some films with a slightly higher budget than Jack London. If he had a little more money, Bronston could have got James Cagney or Spencer Tracy, both of whom would have been right for the role. Instead they got Michael O'Shea who was making his second film after Lady of Burlesque. O'Shea is fine in the part, but it certainly wasn't at the box office. <br /> <br /> While London is covering the war, he meets a Captain Tanaka played by Leonard Strong, an actor specializing in Orientals and played a lot in World War II. From the point of view of 1905 Strong profiles in the best tradition of Fu Manchu The imperial goals of Japan end up taking the United States in the end. It must have gone very well with the swing swing crowd. <br /> <br /> Much is left out of life in London, including a first wife. Playing the second and only wife in this film is Susan Hayward entering the film only when it's over. Maybe we would have seen more of her. Charmian Kittredge London survived her husband for almost 40 years dying in 1955. <br /> <br /> In fact, O'Shea met and married the protagonist of his life in Jack London. Virginia Mayo has a small role in Jack London and they married for 30 years until O'Shea's death in 1973. <br /> <br /> Maybe one day we will have a vision of Jack London that will be much better than this.
