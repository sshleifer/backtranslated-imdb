Well, I just ordered it on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and I needed a laugh. I have to admit, I giggled a couple of times, but I don't even remember which parts they were. I don't understand why this film was made. He claims to be a comedy but seriously, I don't find a singer penis or a 70-year-old woman very funny. This film was trying to adapt to the "gross" comedies of recent years like American Pie and Road Trip, but failed miserably. It was a very rough way, then it was comedy. Also, why did Cameron Diaz assign his name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy, fun and well done. In addition to this, avoid this movie. 3/10
