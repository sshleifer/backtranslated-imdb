American films about war and the Nazis simply can't be good. They cannot refrain from becoming idiots and follow an agenda. All the Nazis are bad, crazy, too proud and the Americans are so modest yet so capable, sensitive and human. Come on, stop with these shit. The main character says something like "with this process, we must make war aggressive a crime". America is a peaceful nation with its "defense" budget n. $ 1 420 (No. 2 in China with $ 51b)? Is it simply spent on this without any ... ROI? Why paint America as a peaceful nation when it is not? I don't love films with an agenda deeply: they throw the art to the devil and try to persuade us to believe in something. Hollywood should put a label on films, just like record companies have that "parental advice" label. We should have a "consulting crap", "propaganda advisory" or a "politically correct advisory" label on some films. This is one of them.
