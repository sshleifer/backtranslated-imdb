we talk about your waste of money .. I'm just wondering why Michael would act in a turkey like a movie..Michael is a great actor especially in the movie where he plays a man who dies of cancer .. it was wonderful. while he ties up with his son to see him when he grew up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so what made him do this ??? I looked at it and thought it was really stupid .. I think at once in their career they have bad movies .. especially "The Squeeze" I didn't understand it at all, and I feel that his best performance was in " Pacific Heights "", his character really scared me ... and I really liked "Multiplicity" ... that was so much fun !!! and was perfect for the role of "Batman" .. and I liked "Night Shift "and I also love" Johnny Dangerously ".. too bad that some of them end up making bad movies .. like this was ...
