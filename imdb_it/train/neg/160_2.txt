I really wanted to appreciate this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Calamity Jane", all present in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as main actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> The problem was ..... it wasn't. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes from this, bored to death. The character of Jean Arthur was somewhat annoying and James Ellison neither looked nor behaved like "Buffalo Bill". Even Cooper wasn't at his best, he looked too wooden. This happened several years before he came to the fore as an actor. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, his western shot blanks. Go up the pace and look at another oater because most of them were much better than this one.
