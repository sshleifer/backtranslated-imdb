The good: <br /> <br /> Effective color scheme. Good costumes. First class production. Well detailed CGI buildings and vehicles. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> A horrible mix of actors with all the CGI actors mixes Fifth Element with Final Fantasy. The CGI actors look even worse than video games a few years ago. Faulty logic. Is a giant pyramid presented and no one looking for it, no one even questioning it? And is there no explanation as to why the god Horus was even cast out, nor was there a reason he had to do something as trivial as impregnating Jill? <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> Script terrible. So many useless subplots with too many ideas that are not fully realized. The dialogue was almost ridiculous in some places. Characters and random events that are not necessary. Boring characters. Jill should be this mystery, but apparently she was just a mystery to the writer. There is nothing for her. It's not interesting and boring to watch. You have no substance, no plot. His character has no saving qualities. In fact, there is no character in the entire film that has a purpose, goals (besides the obvious of Horus), some motivation. They are weak and poorly conceived. There are no stakes - the key to write on the screen. Horus will not become immortal, but, big deal, he is a bad boy. You can't even decipher if Horus or Jill are the main character. This is the problem: dedicating half of the film to each character means that the writer never completely explores a character, never completes it. They are cardboard cutouts that walk and talk and practically do nothing but explore the beautiful pieces. Stimulation of the director for the first time. Slow, slow, slow. I'm still watching the movie as I write this. I can't pay attention because it's boring. Everything is flat. Also the action is not interesting because it is of short duration and sometimes not necessary. <br /> <br /> In general: <br /> <br /> It is not worth looking at. Worn out stories, development of secondary characters, insignificant CGI does not save the beautiful production of the set.
