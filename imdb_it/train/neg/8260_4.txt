First of all, I would like to point out that while I'm not an expert, the way the process was handled will insult your intelligence. First of all, the prosecution has never shown that facilitated learning actually works. Irresponsible both for the accusation (because they can get an appeal) and for the defense of not doing so. As another commentator said, facilitated learning has been proven not true. Secondly, they used Terry as a translator who has a personal interest, and will also testify, in the process that he is simply stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify like that, they would have brought someone neutral, otherwise they would have simply asked for an appeal. Third, this child was never asked specific questions about the accused by the prosecution (cravings, details of the event, etc.) And even when specific defense questions, such as when it started, could not be answered . If this is not reasonable I don't know what it is and a competent lawyer would have obtained an acquittal. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, it starts well with the pressure of being the parent of a child with autism, but the process makes this film completely incredible.
