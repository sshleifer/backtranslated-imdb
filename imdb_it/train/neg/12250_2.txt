After seeing the gem of Tobe Hooper, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in the college / crocodile niche of the exploitation / monster genus. I look forward to a rebel producer following several sequels of these delicious bonbons of the goodness of the field. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of elegance and dignity to these extraordinary scripts. With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monks creating special crocodile effects on a computer, all we would need would be a crocky fodder cast with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants. <br /> <br /> While the crisp artwork of Tobe Hooper referred to his films, Blood Surf chose to put together a series of themes aged from the chum bucket of other films. See if you can look past the sequel to Revenge of the Nerds to find allusions / giveaways? / Rip-off of Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also, try to find the ready-for-tv fade in which the editor has given up making sense of the title. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that the shard could not prove his tenor subtitle with a soliloquy on environmentalism ... or crocky appreciation, but the almost-captain Achab of the story makes the his tour de force. Perhaps, in the coming years, we will see a shard galloping after a shooting in a golden sunset. Or, hopefully, a monkey throws a shard in the cabinet of an international space station for dwarves and enjoys exploiting the exploitative waltz of a shedding of monkey-dwarf / midget / crocodile zero-G blood. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, the lack of a whammy bar in surf music annoyed me.
