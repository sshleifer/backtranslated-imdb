"Revolt of the Zombies" demonstrates that having the same revamp as the director and recycling an idea does not necessarily make lightning twice. <br /> <br /> The Halperin brothers, responsible for the classic horror "White Zombie", did this a few years later and managed to profit from its popularity and even recycled close-ups of Lugosi's eyes from that previous film. There was a legal battle with the rights owners of the movie "White Zombie", who did not want Halperin to use the word "zombie" in this title. That word was the only thing that could help this film, because, as everyone knows, bad movies can earn much more simply by making the word "Zombie" appear in the title. Knowing what Victor Halperin was capable of some years ago makes this film uninteresting more offensive. It seems he never directed another horror movie after this debacle. The zombies here seem to be not dead alive, but simply victims of hypnotism. <br /> <br /> Do you want to create a mind-controlled army of zombies? Get ready to smash some eggs, including yours. <br /> <br /> THE LAME PLOT: The man falls in love with an intriguing woman who plays with his heart and gets engaged to him just to be his friend, who loves, jealous. This sends the man into a spiral of madness in which he tries to use zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn't worth spitting. <br /> <br /> This includes one of the most obviously obvious plot developments I've ever seen. You should be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming. The acting is not even good. This film makes the "King of the Zombies" insensitive to race (which appeared on the same dubbing I bought) and seems like a masterpiece of atmospheric horror by comparison and reminds us that not all black and white films are a classic. It makes the sci-fi sci-fi hymn "Invisible Invaders" sound like a serious drama. This is a big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic that it could probably make many fans of the Korean film contract (South Korean films are often known for their use of melodrama). The credits ironically list the favorite movie company. I'm not sure of his favorite movie, but I'm obviously an idiot. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for fans of zombies, romance or classic movies.
