There was something here with the female protagonist who has this perfect life she always wanted after the worst life possible, starting as a child into prostitution and ending up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible to trust Dean Cain and this eventually destroys him completely. It sounds strange, but I like Dean Cain's position in the end and the choice he made. He can't hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his son (I think the lapse of time makes it clear that he is his son and not his brother's), but at the same time he can't forgive her for all he did, sleep with his brother (who shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much a way) and then be part of his death. In better hands this would have been a better film, but for something I caught on the cable late at night, it's not bad.
