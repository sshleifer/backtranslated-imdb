Unless you are already familiar with the pop stars acting in this film, save yourself the time and stop reading this review after you have reached the end of the next sentence. <br /> <br /> FORGET FORGET YOU HAVE BEEN BLOCKED FILM AND GO LOOK SOMETHING MORE. <br /> <br /> But if you insist on reading, consider: <br /> <br /> Lame vehicle for Japanese teenagers of idol teenici with a complicated and twisted "plot" that drags on an insensitive amount of time until when you're not ready to scream. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this film makes sense. It is an infinite series of people who express various emotions, from joy to anger, from happiness to tragedy, FOR NO GOOD REASON. We can obviously see something incredibly "dramatic" happening, but they simply DO NOT GIVE A CRAP BECAUSE because there is no background. <br /> <br /> When this movie ends, you will be tired and tired of these stupid, lanky and girly star faces. You will be disgusted to have spent all this time watching them smile, grin, cry, look mysterious, be "serious" and any other useless expression slapping their faces. <br /> <br /> That some moron would never go so far as to refer to this piece of tasteless garbage as "the soul" of one of its "actors" should prove you beyond the shadow of doubt what the trailer is the countless adoring comments on this site will not tell you: <br /> <br /> Only the "converted" and senseless servants will appreciate this movie, most of them teenagers with pathological adoration for anything androgynous. Freud would have a field day. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of these "disrespectful" fans, "stay away from this abomination.
