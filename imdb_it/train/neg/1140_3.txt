Scary, but above all in the sense that it will end before he turns 70. I saw this as a reworking late at night around 1976 and I thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but only). <br /> <br /> Ray Milland is a bit scary because it looks like he was stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux seems to have smoked all the beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /> <br /> It's kind of like a Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is a turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on a Saturday morning and there's nothing about the 1972 roll championship replays, then I think it's better. But God help you if this is your only choice for entertainment.
