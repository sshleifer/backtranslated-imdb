A saga of "misfit-in-the-army", which barely tries to be both surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (the flatulence gags), but ends up being a mix of many different types of humor, none of them followed very successfully. Barbara Bach, the Bond Girl of "The Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
