I really have nothing new to add but I felt like I had to comment on this bag. So here it is: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I'm flipping through my MST3K DVD collection again and I've just seen the Hobgoblin for the tenth time. It is really, really painful but it was the next on the list ... We see that there is a small kernel of a real movie buried under all the shit that is "Hobgoblins" but could not get out. Everything about this film is fourth speed. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the ... ahhhh forget it. I can see a piece of shit like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") again and again and with very few negative effects (I like it - btw, it will be on TCM at the end of this month - October 2009) but " Hobgoblins "is another child's play. <br /> <br /> The worst part of it all could be that now it's about 12 hours after the end of the film, I slept well, some coffee and a dry toast, my medications, yet the new dance music "New Wave "that Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman played in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This torment will last for days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, isn't it?
