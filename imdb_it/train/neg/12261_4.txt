Classic "paint-by-numbers" rate, full of a series of large film plot devices. It is as if someone had a deck of cards with ideas for the plot of other films written about them, which were mixed and treated. Whatever plot and characters were included in the agreement were then thrown into the script. <br /> <br /> The characters are so trivial, that you can play a game of "Guess who ends up like a monster" in less than ten minutes in the movie, and probably take every single good - including the order that will come devoured. Many of the characters are so hateful that they force the creature to close them. Some of the main characters include: a clone of Billy Idol that sails with sharks, a brat who mumbles bankrolls, a boy from Captain Ahab with a vengeance, and the girl from Ahab who does squalid ballads in a bar. Oh, and a big, big beast in need of anger management therapy. <br /> <br /> Along the way, people talk a lot, pretty girls run in wet t-shirts, couples go out on exotic beaches, explosions occur, shrine ruins appear and fat-faced pirates descend . <br /> <br /> Funny, for the most part, but one thing bothered me: the insensitivity of the characters when other people were killed. After a violent death, they make jokes on one side. I could almost hear the shots. <br /> <br /> Overall, OK, if you have 90 minutes to lose, and you want to laugh about such a good movie. Otherwise, you can skip this.
