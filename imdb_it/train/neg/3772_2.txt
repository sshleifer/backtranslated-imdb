I just saw Dick Tracy and thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities seemed horrible. Even the characters in the crowd seemed too strange. Warren Beatty didn't do a bad job like Dick Tracy but it was definitely not one of his best shows. Madonna should simply sing. Glenne Headly did a good job in this film. I gave this film a 2/10 only for the extraordinary acting of Al Pacino. It wasn't a high note in his career, but he did a good job.
