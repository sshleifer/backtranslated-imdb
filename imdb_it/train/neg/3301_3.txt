The standard procedure for Swedish films today seems to start throwing the plausibility out the window and continue on this path for the rest of the process. RÃ¥narna is another fine example of a film that makes little sense. <br /> <br /> Stockholm's banks are being robbed by a highly efficient band of "military-style" robbers. Two policemen begin to investigate the case which soon becomes more complicated than it would seem in the beginning. <br /> <br /> As usual in the Swedish film, the cast is mostly made up of the same people you've seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be present in all Swedish films of recent years! But okay I suppose that Persbrandt is one of the few who performs solidly here (as he usually does). The problems with this film revolve mainly around the story itself. First of all the robberies seem mostly as a background. Rather, this is more a film about a young policewoman who fights to prove herself in a male world (like the one that hasn't been done a thousand times before with a decent actress in place of Sofia Helin). Also there is an absolutely incredible twist near the end that seems as plausible as the aliens that land. But anyway, I thought it was a very nice touch considering I was half asleep right then. He increased things a little (and actually saved the evaluation from another step). <br /> <br /> In the end the main problem is the same as in most other Swedish films of this type. Simply that the action and the suspense are not up to the standards we are used to from other films of this type (mainly Hollywood). It looks cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion, Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget about trying to do "action light in Hollywood" as they do now. Because this becomes yet another effort forgotten by the Swedish film industry. I consider it 3/10.
