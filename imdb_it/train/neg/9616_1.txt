First of all, I had my doubts watching the DVD box and reading it saying that it was a group of teenagers who gathered in a lake where they would find something or something. Every movie that has a premise like this has failed miserably, even as a slasher movie, except for the first Friday 13. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I kept thinking that had to improve a little. It was not so. Usually, I think every movie has something you can take from it. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive to do for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself the papercuts, or eat the dirt.
