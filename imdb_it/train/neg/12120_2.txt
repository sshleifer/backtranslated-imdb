In what could have been another film by the mill, a mediocre film on infidelity in the 1960s (the subtle period of "free-love"), the creators of this film pile up on a ridiculous scenario after a ridiculous scenario and complete the all with a trivial little cherry on top, happy and happy forever. At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their annoying middle-class care life, nor did I feel for the eminent Liev Shrieber. The plot moves slowly towards its predictable and pathetic conclusion and the only interesting and watchable thing about this film is the gorgeous topless Diane Lane. Here's a suggestion, it occurs about 30 minutes into the movie. Fast forward to that side and skip the rest.
