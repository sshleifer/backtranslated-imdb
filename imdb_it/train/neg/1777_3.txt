If you're the kind of viewer who enjoys original content and intelligent suspense ... then look elsewhere, guys, because Sleepwalker really sucks. I'm usually more eloquent than this, but ... wow ... that was bad. I especially like it when Charles offers Tanya a ride home, she refuses, and then WALKING shows up at home. Where's his car ?? Anyway, I just don't see it, folks. I really want to be more specific, but the words escape me. Cats jump on people. A boy is stabbed by corn. Cheesey aligns the proverbial "wazoo". Just don't see it. Wait, I'll take that back! Watch it for the cameo of writer Stephen King as the owner of the cemetery. It's actually pretty good. Even with guest appearances by Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best interpretation of the film. But apart from that ... wow ... BAD.
