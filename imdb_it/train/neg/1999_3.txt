At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity. For good reason! The superpiccolo has left his little gray cells (sorry Agatha) at home for this story. There is no deductive reasoning, no acute analysis of the signs in the crime scenes. Holmes mumbles about fifty yards behind the plot. The vile CAM is finally treated by a frail old man - in a way that would make Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride - six bullets in the barn. In a chasing chase, a pursuer takes hold of one of Watson's shoes. Maybe the writer doesn't decide to face the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film. The murderer, Holmes and Watson, flee from Scot. Oh well, it's a bit of a change of pace in the late Victorian period in London. A little law on the six rifles :-)
