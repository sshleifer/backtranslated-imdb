I loved the Apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things are just getting too tiring. <br /> <br /> I liked the show, but it became the ego fest of Donald Trumps. Assuming it's your company you're working for, but come on! some of the things that say "YOU ARE UNKNOWN" are just offensive. <br /> <br /> after watching the show, I wouldn't want to work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or so. It's just that the show is unrealistic and the way it handles things just makes me squirm. Good entertainment? YES, but tiring as the back stabs it becomes so tiring .. it's not teamwork, it's not personal, it's just a bargain. look at your rear jack.
