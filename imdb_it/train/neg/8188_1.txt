The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous film is its presumption that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his family and his significant other live forever. We forget that to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and that the saints have no significant others. That, for a millennium, Nick was the Jolly Elf of Fred's Scrooge is never even mentioned! Open up Nick by learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning how to run the numbers; Nick giving a sick child a dolly, Fred buying back the dolly, along with the family farm! After some other such episodes, morphs the current Fred to vent his spleen to anonymous siblings while his fellow losers nod with empathy. There, I just wrote a more cohesive plot of this idiocy! <br /> <br /> This Santa Claus, who is a "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" far from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss afflicted by the Queen of the Harpies, an operation just out of the hell of the Mega-Mall, and the answers to a Council (eh?) that has just given the Easter Bunny its pink egg. Oh, and his right arm is a cheeky blonde in a tight-fitting mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me over the limit was the fact that Slam was named # 1 on the Bad List. Shouldn't a bad list be reserved for future Hitler and Stalin? Children who are the true incarnations of evil? No, at Old Sausage-Fingers, a good guy who lashes out because he's unwanted and unloved is the demon's seed! <br /> <br /> Fred Claus's nimrods should be boiled in their pudding! Bah!
