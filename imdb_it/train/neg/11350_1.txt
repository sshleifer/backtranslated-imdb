As long as there was 3d technology, (I believe in the 1950s) there was an animation created for this. I remember in particular, a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale. At the moment I don't remember the name, but the plot was that Donald worked in a circus, he was feeding a nut of elephants and Chip and Dale were stealing peanuts. This was done to look in 3D probably in the 1960s. If you happened to see Meet the Robinsons in 3D in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the film and explained the details of its origin. There are probably about 100 cartoons made specifically for viewing through 3D glasses. This statement was a bad move, because it is not difficult to prove that they are wrong. Besides, it looks like a bad movie.
