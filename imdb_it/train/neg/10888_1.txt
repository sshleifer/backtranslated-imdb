This film is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story almost does not exist, the characters are full of stereotypes and the special-FX just makes you laugh. The only remarkable thing about this film is the appearance of rapper Coolio as a sort of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this film was to be a comedy, I didn't understand the point. If you want to watch this movie: please get drunk first and then get ready to have a good laugh ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like cheap junk movies: this movie is a must for you.
