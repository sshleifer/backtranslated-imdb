The only reason I saw "Shakedown" was the presence of Erika Eleniak. He is as sexy as ever, but plays the second violin with the protagonist Wolf Larson. It's a shame, because it has more capacity for action than it can show here. The film is largely composed of endless shootings that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you see the bad guys armed with machine guns who constantly miss Larson and he armed only with a revolver (which never runs out of bullets) bringing them all out pretty easily. The effects of the earthquake are decent, but there is also a lot of blurry movement and little explosions in CGI. As the psychotic "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he has to cast is simply boring. Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (assuming he has some) the completists might want to take a look at this, for others it's hardly a rent. (* 1/2)
