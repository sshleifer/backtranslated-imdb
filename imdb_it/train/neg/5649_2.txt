I don't think it's too bad a show in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not really lawyers. God forbids anyone from attending law school based on these shows, which I had heard when I saw some interviews with the show. It just made me gag a little. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, Spader and Shatner, who should be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. While this could be a compliment in some situations, it certainly isn't here. Their constant harassment of women on the show is fun at the beginning. But since that's what they are doing literally all the time, I realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Trying to intersperse some serious, dramatic and even tearful moments in the midst of this mockery of a real show cannot compensate for the progressive loss of interest that I tried to try to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> The flaming and free "public service announcements" by Alan Shore, where he spits his opinions, do not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed for him and the writers of the show for Crane's speech wearing a colonial suit. <br /> <br /> I'm giving two stars because there are times when I thought about the show's attempts to tackle some contemporary issues that were carefully made. <br /> <br /> I think the authors of the show realized that the sexual harassment shown by Denny and Alan were becoming bullies even for those who were more inviting from them from the beginning. The fact is that I don't care if the treatment for sexual harassment on the show was done well, but I felt that the writer was insulting me with artificial sexual inactivity throughout the show in the hope that my libido would prevent me from coming back for more. I am no longer a teenager, and I think this show is promising if its goal was not to satisfy the lowest common denominator to get votes. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm writing it after I realized that it wouldn't be much better than that. It's a shame because it's one of those shows that I'd like to love.
