Thank God, I saw this at a friend's house and I didn't pay for it. The plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie looks like an episode of a TV show. If you have any computer or electronic knowledge, be careful. You'll feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the actress shot Much Music VJ Amanda Walsh shows the worst acting I've ever seen, excluding porn. She's lucky that Matt Lanter is actually decent. That's what the movie brings. <br /> <br /> I hate that I lost almost two hours of my life watching this movie! It is a pity that they had a following, because I was a fan of the original, which was actually quite good.
