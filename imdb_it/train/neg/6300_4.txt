this seemed a strange combination of Withnail and I with A Room with a View .. sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. tragedy that changed the name for the release in the US though .. Keeping the Apidistra Flying much better than the title A Merry War. acting was ok, the script was ok .. overall it was a mediocre film ..
