Well, I like to be honest with all the people I bought because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I haven't seen much of it. All the sex scenes were short and randomly made along with all the weird and mushy background music just like all the other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a small piece of plot towards the end - Kira's new lover is a murderer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why don't we name this film for the Oscar? I can't imagine how bad the movie would be if it were R-rated (mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and leave, so you won't end up being an idiot like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
