I have to pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way because it was really painful. Does an incapable painter become a fully capable killer? This film was full of absurdities of which, if I mentioned them all, I would give the film. Norm Peterson, aka George Wendt, must be really in trouble for agreeing to make this film. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. Being a reasonable and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from, or where he was going with this film. There was ineptitude on the part of every main character, there was a series of unfortunate and ridiculous events, then the film ended. An absurd act after another with dialogue does not make a film, it only makes a colloquial scrap.
