A comparison between this film and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is flatter than a section of Interstate Highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the desert, there's not much to distinguish, not even the fact that a prisoner is transported by two naval escorts this time. No one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script it is not surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, will not give much space to this if he ever wrote a memoir, I don't think.
