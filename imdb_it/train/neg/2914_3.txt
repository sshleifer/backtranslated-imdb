The title above is used to present the film "Gen" to its audience. Gen speaks of a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The film begins with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While driving, we realize that she is not as close as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as he enters the hospital garden, he sees the body of a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare for the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two policemen come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, they will have to stay in the hospital because all the roads are cut due to bad weather conditions. All their communications with the outside world are also interrupted. There is no way out !! In those few days, there will be more bad murders. Now everyone suspects one another. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. There are positives to the film, of course. I really like the beginning of the film. Especially when driving to the hospital and in his first moments in the hospital. The documents are in place. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock should have been extended to the end of the film. What I'm saying is that it was a good turning point, but instead of showing it as a travesty at the end, we should have realized that it would come when we see what's happening. The director needed to explain it completely and I think it didn't work well. Even the most dangerous patient in the film should be at least 48 years old but his body looks so young and fit for someone who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure it will improve. This is his first attempt. I recently discovered that he is only 21 years old. This made me feel more positive about him and his future films. However I will not evaluate this movie * of *****.
