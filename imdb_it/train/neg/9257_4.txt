If you're hoping for SOMETHING again, you've chosen the wrong movie. Who can think that a film that is a virtual replay of its predecessors can be good. Maybe the producer and maybe the director, but I hope they weren't serious when they did this. The whole film is like making a very successful DVD of the first 3 films, but changing the actors. BHHAAAAD.
