The sitcom "The league of Gentlemen" follows the lives of some bizarre inhabitants of the fictional village "Royston Vasey". The different scenes are linked together by their common setting. <br /> <br /> In the first series, a sketch show, the main plot concerns a new road that will be built through Royston Vasey. As a result, more foreigners visit the small town. But Edward and Tubbs, the owners of a "local" store, which is actually far from the city, do not like foreigners. Every time a visitor enters their shop, they kill him. In my opinion some scenes are almost tasteless and not at all funny, for example when the couple absorbs two engineers who want to build the new road. Edward drums, while Tubbs dances half naked around the victims. <br /> <br /> Pauline also lives in Royston Vasey. He works at the local employment center. Although Pauline hates the people she has to work with, the woman does not want to lose her job. So when an unemployed person gets an interview as a fireman, he doesn't allow him to go because he's not ready for work yet. <br /> <br /> Then there's Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver who goes into great detail about "his" sexual conversion. <br /> <br /> In addition, the vet, Mr. Chinnery, always kills the animals instead of treating them. In one case, he arrives at a farm and is led into the living room, where a dog lies in his basket. The farmer goes out. Assuming the dog is the sick animal, Mr. Chinnery suppresses it. A second later, the farmer opens the door, holding the "real" sick animal, a sheep. <br /> <br /> Some other inhabitants are a husband and his wife who are visited by their nephew (his by the way, the friend is killed by the shop owners). The couple is very tidy. They have, for example, towels in different colors. Each color represents a part of the body. Moreover, they have thousands of keys, marked with different colors and precisely classified. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the actors play very well. Playing with women, the scenes become comical. The costumes are also suitable for the actors. Tubbs wears a scarf and some crazy characters, such as Edward, have unappetising black teeth. The show has a great deal of black, typical English humor. The set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and have fallen. Around the local shop there is often fog that reinforces the threatening effect. Even the village sign is disturbing: "Welcome to Royston Vasey. You will never leave." <br /> <br /> Even though I think the actors do a great job, this kind of series is not my taste.
