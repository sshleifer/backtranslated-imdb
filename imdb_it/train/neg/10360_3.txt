I was excited when I saw the commercials for this film because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. However, the film did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently he prepared me for a big disappointment, as often happens when the stories are translated into films. The characters don't seem to fit the book very well. The management was weak. I had trouble getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what was happening. He just looked slapped and ran. All in all I was very disappointed with the film. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might make you read the book, which you'll probably like best. <br /> <br />
