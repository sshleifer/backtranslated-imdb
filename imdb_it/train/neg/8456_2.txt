I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I managed to stay until the end. It was a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked jean hugues anglade, but I think he needed to eat, like us, and so he agreed to star in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters, and the rest could be called 'art' or something I couldn't express, but I didn't understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I saw was crash, but I'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to see it successfully again. <br /> Good luck! ; OR)
