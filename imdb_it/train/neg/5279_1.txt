My friends usually manage to put up with a lot of hopeless films, but this was too poor to let us watch it until the end. It was just so boring and unoriginal. Not even the "sexy" girls who starred in this movie could keep me watching. Everything was predictable and annoying. <br /> <br /> The acting was sometimes good ..... but bad times. The most annoying character of the whole movie that you wanted to just die had to be the best friend of the main characters. The more I saw it, the more I wanted to destroy my screen. (you know what fat bad boy I'm talking about) <br /> <br /> The plot has been done so many times before I think they should be sued by other film companies. OK, it's a good idea, but that's all this movie had. <br /> <br /> In general, this film can only be seen by yourself, to save any abuse from your friends. Or if you have absolutely nothing better to do.
