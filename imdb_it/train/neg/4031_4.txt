It really is a terrible cheat of a movie. Its 70 minutes of operation are very well padded with archive material. The rest are non-descriptive exteriors and squalid interior scenes. The display of the plot is very bad. They are just superficial scenes joined together. There is no attempt at dramatization in the selection of the scenes, but rather the drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. Please don't ask. <br /> <br /> The plot concerns a rocket that radiates a radius of a million degrees orbiting the earth for five miles threatening to destroy the earth. It is a real-time threat that must be diverted if a custom-built H-bomb can be modeled and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. There is not much to say here apart from a crazy speech by a scientist against the project because there could be some sort of life on board and think about scientific possibilities, but this discourse made by the liberal idiot obligation was practically passed by then. /> <br /> What saves this film, somehow unique, is the archive material. I've never seen a wider selection of 50's fighter planes in any other film. This is by no means a complete list but just some of the planes I could see. There is a brief interception by a pilot who flies, alternately, an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86. The first thing to do to intercept the interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force of Hawker Hunters and F-86 Saber Jets (or CF-13 built in Canada) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks. <br /> <br /> So for some reason the B-52s, B-47s and even B36s are seen taking off. More padding. <br /> <br /> "These Canadian jets move at 1200 miles per hour". I don't think so since one of them seems to be a World War II Gloster Meteor, the other F-80s. The Meteors press the attack and one turns into an F-84F late with a straight-wing F-84 flight attacking in formation. <br /> <br /> There is a strange version of the tandem cockpit of the F-80 that does not make T seem to be the type of T-33 training but a kind of temporary inter-variant for interceptor with radar in the nose . These are scrambled in a snow storm. <br /> <br /> An aircraft carrier at an angle is seen from about 500 meters. Lancia F-8U Crusaders, F-11F Tigers, A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors. The Air Force combines F-86 and F-84 and other F-89s you've ever seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Sabers and F-102 Delta Daggers. <br /> <br /> The F -100 press their attack with tremendous padding. The F-89s unload their missiles in their wing containers in the slo mo. The F-86s shoot, an F-102 triggers a Falcon, even some F-80s (F-94s?) With rocket missiles launched at mid-wing. There is a very strange shot of a late F-84 (prototype?) Model with a straight wing F-85 above it in one lap, obviously an advertising film by the producer (Republic Aviation) showing the differences between the old and the new improved F-84 ThunderJet models. How it has crept in here is guessing someone else. <br /> <br /> There are other great Ottawa archive footage of ancient times where the capital of Canada was a broad point on the road and especially wonderful footage of the New York Times Square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s. <br /> <br /> I think we must also take care that this film was shot in Canada with the possible exception of the automatic tracking seen late in the image while the Pacific appears to be in the background. The use of Jowett Jupiter is quite stunning and there is also a nice TR 3 to see. Canada must have been cheap and is used rather loosely in the background. <br /> <br /> As for the true narrative of the film there is little to recommend it besides the mystery of who Ellen Parker is by giving the finger at the end of the image. And she's definitely launching someone. Could it be, R as in Robert Loggia? Has the director who dies before this film been released? Was your career like this your last credit? <br /> <br /> It is like the paper in which the gift was wrapped was more precious than the gift.
