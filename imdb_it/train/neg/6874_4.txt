Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, The Big Blue, Dogville) directed and starred in this strange film which is the second installment of a sort of trilogy. I could be wrong, but I don't think this film is part of the Dogma '95 manifesto, even if it really looks like this. I'm not sure what I think of this movie. All the actors are good They offer pretty good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is somehow interesting. But I don't know, there's something in the film that I don't like. Sex scenes are too long. Switch from an interesting work of art to a piece of erotic shit. I don't know exactly where it is. Of course it's not a bad movie, but I won't suggest people to see it or tell them not to look. Do as you wish If you feel curious and open minded, try it, you might like it.
