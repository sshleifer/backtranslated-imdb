Pokemon 3 is little more than three or four episodes of the TV series, put together without the usual advertisements. The story is typical of Pokemon (conflict, fighting and a resolution in which everyone is happy in the end), and there is nothing original or unusual in the animation. Some of the holes in the plot are compiled (beyond the end credits!) Without explanation, and everything is just a little too sweet. <br /> <br /> Why see it on the big screen? The only reason is to be part of your child's world. Both of my children enjoy Pokemon, and from my showing an interest in what they want, we are closer. Seeing a movie in a theater is still different from seeing it on the tube, and my kids like the whole cinematic experience. I gave the film a 4, especially from the point of view of my children. <br /> <br />
