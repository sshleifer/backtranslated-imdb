Eight nominations for the academy? It's incredible. I can only think it was a bad year, even by Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as lead I probably would have swallowed the bait and watched it anyway, but the Oscar nominations actually sold it to me, and I feel clearly cheated as a result. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy right? Can anyone tell me where the humor in Prizzi's Honor is? It's certainly tasteless (the shooting in the head of a cop's wife is just another presumably comical interlude in this intentional farce about mafia life) but with the exception of a joke about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (which I imagine is an old one joke for Americans who have been officially banned from buying something Cuban in the last 50 years) I didn't notice anything comic in nature - and I tried. There is a lot of clichés of the mafia, but the clichés do not constitute humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a kind of romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredible and superficial that they are on a par with Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is it a cleverly elaborated parody of the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply absurd, rather than comically absurd, and usually has the feel of a really bad (and cheap) Mafia movie. It looks more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and a bit of humor written for them, the actors are allowed to give evasive hints and pull faces. Well, it's not enough; even when the face is pulled by that master of comic facial expression, Jack Nicholson (filled with the upper lip swollen ... is now destined to be a parody of Brando's stuffed cheeks in The Godfather? ... Oh! I care ? ... all I know is, it's not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw some slow and tiring direction (this film drags on for 2 hours), a hopelessly stupid and cliché like dialogue; "Do you remember the Camora? Well we are much bigger, we will track you wherever you go", and cliched mannerisms and you will be reached for that fast forward button before you can say "capiche?". Prizzi's honor is far from being Huston's "masterpiece" and is rather a last, very poor job. It is certainly a work in the canon of the great director that should be delivered with a concrete coat and thrown into the Hudson River.
