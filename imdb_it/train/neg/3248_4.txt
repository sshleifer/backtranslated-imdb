Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was part of it and he made hilarious films in the past that made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for waiting again? Also, the premise, the funny trailer, the involvement of his co-star Jennifer Aniston and the fact that it was a huge success in the United States encouraged me. <br /> <br /> However, as my "One Line Summary" suggests, I was disappointed. For different reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: it wasn't fun. In a 2-hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking "I should have had an ice cream". I admit that maybe it's wrong to judge Jim Carrey in his previous films, but what he really expects when he makes Gem's like "The Truman Show", "Liar Liar", "Me, Myself and Irene", "Dumb and The Dumber movies", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura" then produce, in the words of Bruce Nolan, such a mediocre film? <br /> <br /> Reason 2: the role of Jennifer Aniston has been criminally subscribed. I want to say hi! around the public for about ten years and in this film gets about four lines to say Broken 3. <br /> <br /> Reason 3: a word - Clich√© <br /> <br /> Reason 4: a random display of specifically American references - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite "sweeps week" - is a hint of the specific charm of the film is at home. "A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an education - this is a miracle ! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle! "God tells Bruce, a heavy-handed feeling that seems to have gone down in the United States, but could face harsher resistance in markets that retain a hint of subtlety. Furthermore, I still go to school, and this statement suggests to me that all my friends are miracles ... or maybe it just means that we have brains? <br /> <br /> In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you laugh and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a calamity total, but we advise you to start reviewing your expectations downwards.
