This film is a huge load of pants. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad script. And his direction is almost comatose as can be without his being sleepwalking during the process. <br /> <br /> But the worst is Woody Harrelson, who usually likes me when he is properly chosen. He plays "the walker", a homosexual man in D.C. which acts as a social companion to bored wives of the Washington elite. It couldn't have been more one-dimensional if it had been cut off from a magazine and bounced off the camera on a popsicle stick. His "southern accent" is the "off the rack" version that decreases from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the South were still drying him with every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the film. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to influence a sort of Middle Eastern accent that is so clumsy that he can barely pronounce the bad sentences written for him. He is unable to launch his r despite the fact that in real life he is German, and you speak several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! It's a good reason to choose someone else, don't you think? <br /> <br /> From the plot, to the script, to the direction, to the work with the camera, to the performances of the protagonists, this film is ugly from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three non-leading actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three have managed to overcome this film with their intact dignity. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being trapped in a really bad film. Unfortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses, look at them in something else. This film is not worth your time.
