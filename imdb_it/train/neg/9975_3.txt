I remember seeing this movie several times as a kid, and there were parts (many in fact) that I didn't understand. I think I saw him once as an adult, so I understood those parts. The only problem with seeing him as an adult was that I didn't care at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a "children's movie"? As soon as. Contains language and topics not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what every parent feels like they are living with their children? Maybe, but then why not focus more on the character of John Ritter instead of Junior? When a film has a 7-year-old child as a protagonist, to do well with the public, it should be a movie for sects and under the crowd, otherwise older people will have no way of relating (even 8-year-old wouldn't want see a movie about a child who is younger than them all year). I'm pretty sure this movie didn't work well at the box office, and the reason must be because it wasn't able to find a niche in the market.
