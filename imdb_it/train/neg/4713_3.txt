As you can imagine from my judgment and from my title of this review I don't like Johnny Test. Now I think I know what people will say, "How do you know how serious it is? Have you ever looked?", I watched this show a couple sometimes because I'm studying film and animation and that doesn't make it hold a candle to my standards. <br /> <br /> I want to talk about animation first because it's one of the most confusing things I've ever seen. Like the first two seasons or just the first season it had hand-drawn animation. I thought it was a beautiful sight to see when it was drawn by hand, but then it switched to flash animation and the quality decreased a lot. <br /> <br /> So this is a strike in my eyes but let's look at the history of the show. It is too difficult to be like Dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of a red-headed scientist there are two and they are both female. There is a talking dog (why?), And the attitudes of the parents have changed somewhat. I have others but I don't think I can write them here (I don't mean to curse, but I want to say that I don't know if there's a word limit). Everything else is perfect, even the character of DeeDee, Johnny himself. Just trying to be Dexter, but it seems like a heartless knockoff. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about the lines. Do you remember some of the screaming jokes in Dexters' lab? Yes, screaming can be good for a joke or two, but Dexter's lab also had cheesy comments that forced me to go back and check to get the joke. Johnny Test forgets everything and screams only 50% of the time and stops the music every time a stupid joke or a lining appears. This is not a comedy, it's a stupid comedy (I know what some people think.) Isn't it a joke of three stupid comedians? Watch it and Johnny Test goes back and laugh more at the first option.). Sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations that, like Chowder, drive me crazy. I have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: for a very bizarre comedy is not comparable, it just makes you think "what am I looking at?". <br /> <br /> So hit on all the accounts. Don't watch this show if you still respect the comedy in any case, shape or form.
