My Take: a tired comedy Christmas comedy. The laughter is tired and even the talents behind seem to be too much. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as much as the next guy (although I often have a bad case of holiday blues), but it looks like it's just a dump for a group of holiday comedies that would be bad movies in any day of the year, but this does not make them less painful during the season. As if we had already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * gulp * that keep counting), who wants to watch a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be at home with the SANTA CLAUSE franchise of Disney (apart from the crude humor and the "Piccolo" Santa's Helper with a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a premise of a joke that goes on for 116 minutes. Sure, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does he go? <br /> <br /> It's really a pity. FRED CLAUS is blessed by a cast that could have made a fun Christmas comedy that will probably melt along with the snow, but it would have been much better than that. Vince Vaughn is the typical snob, but we are led to believe that he is really the long lost brother of the ever old Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti), who invites his good old brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) came to keep a watchful eye on Santa Claus, and his IT close to closing. Hah! And guess who plays Santa's mother! Kathy Bates, of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! I don't know if I would praise the casting or hit it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they are given too little to work with. <br /> <br /> As for humor, the best that FRED CLAUS could find is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and a few jokes about a DJ elf. I have to admit that I had a few giggles involving Fred who was attending a consultancy group for sibling celebrities (where he is joined by Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but giggles start and end there. Worse still, the film succumbs even to sentimentality which should make us feel "good" and teach us a lesson on "what Christmas really means". Apparently, what Christmas means for Hollywood is getting as much money as possible from our Christmas shopping money. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
