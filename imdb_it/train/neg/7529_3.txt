Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film is probably one of the worst films ever made. Bruce Lee dies after falling from a helicopter after being hit by a sort of ninja knife in the back of his neck, but does not explain how he arrived on a helicopter since the previous scene near him but not on the helicopter that is already 200 feet in the air. From that moment it becomes decidedly absurd, like something from a cheap comic. Perhaps the idea is not so disgusting, but it is not made with any degree of artistic skill from a cinema point of view. There are dozens of martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think Jean Claude van Dam has improved the genre by adding plausible stories in his films and with directors who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are definitely better than 90% of martial arts junk movies made in the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, although Bruce Lee is in it.
