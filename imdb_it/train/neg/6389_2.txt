I waited almost 25 years to see this film, thinking that it could be an undervalued job, from a period animation it was no longer the quality it had once been. He starred in one of the best bad films of all time, was based on a beloved series of children's books and was a production of Disney Studios. What could be wrong with this? How it comes out, almost everything. <br /> <br /> Well, not everything. Vincent Price as Rattigan and the marked score of Henry Mancini are the two successful graces of the film. The price is mischievously pleasant, and Mancini more professional than the material deserves. They bring class into a project that otherwise belongs to darkness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile the rest of the film, although full of inadequate adult situations, still suffers from a completely boring script, a generously bland vocal work, terrible songs and lazy animation that wouldn't have been out of place in all the Saturday morning television programs of the mid-1980s by Disney. <br /> <br /> This was a complete disappointment to me. It is surprising that this film was almost contemporary with The Secret of NIMH. Costing a fraction of this, an independent studio has produced something with more creativity in its trailer than GMD in its endless running time. <br /> <br /> The extra star that prevents this from being "terrible" goes to Price and Mancini.
