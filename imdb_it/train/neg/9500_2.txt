This movie is really bad. The acting is simply terrible except Michael Ironside. I don't understand the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-gangs. He comes to a city and is suddenly chosen to fight against the bad people who want Indian land. On the cover he said that he himself was an Indian who also returned to his hometown, I didn't hear it in the film, if so it wasn't clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor. Rigid and ugly. He also said his lines. And let's not talk about Sean Young, she wasn't one of my favorite actors, but in this film she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). It's horrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this because Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. <br /> <br /> Don't see it unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. <br /> <br /> Soon I will go up the list because I have it at home. I wrote it after seeing the movie.
