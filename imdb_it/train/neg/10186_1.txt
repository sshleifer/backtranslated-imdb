Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season movie (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst group of cinemas ever, offering lines that must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style working group composed of Exxon and GM lawyers seeking cut funds for mass transit research and energy efficiency. It seems to have been shot in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. It makes Logan's Run similar to the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I cannot imagine looking at it without Crow's and Servant's comment because it is unwatchable with it too. Clearly what is needed in Hollywood is a kind of 401K that prevents actors from making bad films like this to pay for their health care. With his theme "the rights to pollute and drive", in the end, I almost expect to see a cameo by Charlton Heston where he delivers his "cold hands" speech. Lee, could I have forgiven you for this in 1989, but in 1981?
