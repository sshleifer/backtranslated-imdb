Revenge of the Sith starts with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then it gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and boring machinations that tormented the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the process is the slow - and I mean slow - building up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally arrives, everything will be fine. Not good. Not even good. But it's all right. This film is widely praised for not sucking up paradise like the previous sequels. Instead it is just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive sometimes. Bu lightsabre fights? They are all a fuzzy mess. I think the dark side took over Lucas when he started these prequels and nobody noticed. This will make a lot of money, but thank god it's over, this once-loved franchise has been cut down enough. I saw the 12:01 show and after that I heard a bunch of very young children say, wow, it was great! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same way: I fell asleep in the middle. It was a little boring. I just thought that seeing the birth of Darth Vader would have been better. So we all said.
