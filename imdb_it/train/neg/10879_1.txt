Blades, lame, lame !!! A 90 minute celebration that lasts 89 minutes. A mature setting of atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stink of a script full of clumsy and witty dialogues that is so hard to be hip. Mostly it is simply embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (an example of the dialogue of this film: after having shown his artillery, fast dolly turned to a close-up of the vigilante character of Barbeau ?? she: "all the questions? "Hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad jokes, idiots, homophobics and judging by the effects of the creature, it seems that the director has watched "The Evil Dead" too many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends a great time to rent this turkey and subject it to ninety wasted minutes that will never come back. What an asshole.
