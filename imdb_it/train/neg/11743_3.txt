I can't really say anything bad * or * well about this thing. His characters are pretty funny, he is produced and designed, and professional looking (except for that cheese monster). However, it has no originality, ideas and nothing you haven't seen in ALIEN, PREDATOR, ARMAGEDDON and / or OUTLAND. It's just another formula, cookie cutter, "dirty corporate drones in deep space against an unstoppable monster". Almost a waste of time.
