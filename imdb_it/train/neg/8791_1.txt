Watch out! <br /> <br /> This is shit that other crap won't even deign to be in the company because it's under them! Ok, I understand, let me say something more substantial. <br /> <br /> I saw Ashes of Time a long time ago thinking it was a new version of the highly venerated wuxia tome of a novel due to the director's emerging reputation, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite all this, WKW failed to adapt the novel on the screen according to many wuxia fans; mostly they are just shots of dripping water, beads of sweat, legs of running horses, etc. I couldn't sit for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr Wong's films are another scene after hearing a lot of praise, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start with Chungking Express because it's his most accessible film. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I was led to waste time and money in this piece of presumptuous nothingness. Some professional reviewers have mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and solitude in a large modern city, blah, blah, blah. It's all right if the director has a point of view with something to say about why these things happen and tell them. But no, it simply shows what it is. Faye Wong's recitation is very typical of the Hong Kong style: confused utterance, deer in the broad eye of the lighthouse, tries to be a kind of cute and girl acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired. <br /> <br /> I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who is looking for something new and different, which should be applauded, but not one that has not yet mastered the art of cinematic storytelling, which is what Mr. Wong has been for the last 17 years!
