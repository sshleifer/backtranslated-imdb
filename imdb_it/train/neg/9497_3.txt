you have a strong stomach. Actually, Holden was 55 in filming, but he was 70 years old and lived for another 8 years only. At one point Holden said, "I'm more than twice your age." Ok, try the triple grandfather! The "old enough to be your father" theme they were shooting for didn't work. The elderly granted can sometimes end up with legal adolescents. More power for them, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it. It is not a question of judgment, but the digestive track. I like my food to which it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and cars from the 70s, clothes, furniture, etc. They are worth it if they arrive late at night via cable and you want to see something to cool down for when you go to bed. It would have been nice to see Lenz's blonde friend, the one who engaged her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasantly spacious ... Who was this girl? I'm going to try and find out.
