Ok, let me tell you that none of this will come as a surprise to anyone who has read the other comments. That said, MY G-D, THIS FILM RECEIVED! I mean, WOW, I didn't know it was possible to throw away all the money they obviously made into something and still come out worse than ANY Roger Corman movie! Corman has probably launched this movie at some point but has fallen due to the poor quality of the script! The only reason this film was made in the first place is that someone said, "Hey, zombies are popular. Video games are popular. What game can we get that has zombies? Bad guest? No, somebody else is "Come first. Silent Hill? No, too quiet. People will never sit in a dark room just to be scared. Hey, Sega didn't have a game where people ran by shooting at zombies? They're off the platform platform for little money! '<br /> <br /> Basically they did their best to make a movie that looked like a video game, even to shoot the fight as if the characters were actually playing. <br /> <br /> The first and most important problem is that the original game was horrible I mean, <br /> bad-movie-merchandising-made-in-a-worse-game-in-two-weeks-and-then - d-out-and-buy-by-idiots-and their parents-for-horrible parents. boring. Monsters were boring. The levels were boring. The interface was boring. The case was boring. In other words, this was a boring game. And that was the version of ARCADE. The home version was even worse! With the home version, you didn't even have the gun to hold in your hand while you were getting bored with this useless game! But I digress. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they actually went so far as to actually intercept the actual gameplay scenes during the fight scenes. HUH ??? Did the publisher not have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was a real fight going on? Not to mention the fact that EVERY fight was shot from the perspective of a video game, which could explain the tedious use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game was a first-person shooter (the player proceeds from the character's POV). Maybe that's why they put the game's graphics, to let you know they were alluding to the game ... Right, whatever ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, the only thing that made this ENTRY a A distantly pleasing experience was the fact that everyone in the theater was making fun of the film out loud, so my sudden attacks of hysterical laughter and general disbelief were taken as a common occurrence and they didn't kick me out. <br /> <br /> on, DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE! Don't even deign to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of weeks. To run. Run.
