This series has its occasional ups and downs, and the latter is the case here. There is a nice amount of splashing, with an inventive implementation of the Baby Cart weapons, but the editing film is seriously disconnected, the film is getting rougher than usual. Sometimes, the action slows to a crawl while the camera follows the wordless wanderings of the "puppy", which is almost lost soon. All in all, disappointment. <br /> <br /> That said, there is a quality of oriental spaghetti for music and the action that can win the approval of dedicated viewers. This episode spends much of his time following the boy's minor misadventures, which begins to fix the abyss of death that his father opened for him.
