I was true to my regard for Mr. Glover and Mrs. Goldberg. I saw the whole movie with my family and some friends. I have no idea what the movie was. After much discussion, we all agree that this was not one of their best efforts. <br /> <br /> Not very well associated. It's too rough, and there's little comedy. I'm disappointed. It could have been much better. <br /> <br /> I have waited months to see this film based on the liner notes. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money if you are not a completist and you only want to see all the films of Mr. Glover and Ms. Goldberg. <br /> <br /> It was a poor way to spend an evening.
