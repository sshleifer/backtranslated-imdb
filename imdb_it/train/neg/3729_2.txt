First of all, I saw this film when I was 7 years old in a Christian Scholl I was attending. Needless to say, I was scared out of my mind. Not because it was scary, but because content. Com ... I was 7 years old. However, the cinematography was rather ugly and the acting was poor. It's bad considering I was only 7 and I remember it. The only thing that still haunts me is that terrible song "I wish we were all ready", where the chorus ends with "... you stayed behind". I wouldn't suggest seeing this. I'll probably do it, just for nostalgic reasons. Also, I'm sure the remake is much better. The best part of this film, however, must be when everyone "disappears"; empty cars crashing, lawn mowers running on their own ... pretty hilarious.
