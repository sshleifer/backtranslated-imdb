I question the motive of the creators of this fictional tale of the BTK killer motivations. Are they trying to portray animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think that the people involved with this monster are doing badly enough? What a blatant lack of respect and exploitation of the victims! It was like an experiment on the personality: what upsets you the most, the slaughter or the human murders? They used the real names of some of the victims .... this film was horrible, disrespectful and offensive! The creators of this film used this tragedy for their program! People need to awaken and redesign the line!
