Yes, this movie makes me feel a real horror, when I realized that I paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to see it. The bald guy gives me the impression of being a psychopathic actor and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. Believe me if you appreciate your time, avoid this movie, I understand that a movie requires money to be created and some films don't have that money, but it's not a justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I always support independent films when it deserves support, but films like this are a bad name for this type of film. I'm still traumatized. I will no longer trust any good cover.
