How to wear a shirt for hair. Positively, absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt one of the worst films of all time. Pure torture Zero stars out of ten. A long, boring, hard-working, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and basically artistic scene after another. Thought to be dreamlike and impressionist, the discovered soul is, instead, an unhealthy mush. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son grope and whisper to each other like lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, strong and clear. OK then? <br /> <br /> Repeated more than once by the son is the line, presumably raised by "Lives of the saints", "The love of a father crucifies, a loving son lets himself be crucified". The parallel with God and his son, Christ, is heavy, irrelevant and generous, like everything else. <br /> <br /> Some points of reference on the theme of Russian filiality: "Mother and son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and sons"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov". <br /> <br /> The credits in English indicate the expected international distribution, which means that the excuse cannot be used to understand that you have to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is not even remotely accomplished or compelling as the last "Russian Ark" (2003) by Sokurov. <br /> <br /> As in his "Mother and Son", an equally powerful soporific, some scenes are shot by distorting mirrors, although not as interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, shot from beginning to end through beige filters, making it visually as dramatic as it is numb. A soft focus haze only increases the feeling of drugs. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack stands up, never closes, like a ribbon. An old radio is constantly playing in the background. The Russian romantic melancholy swells to infinity as "themes based on Ciajkovskij". The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov) means, of course, that all those small irritating sounds, static radios, noises, distortions and the like are "designed". <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that anyone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. Everything seems as arbitrary as traffic, as if improvised by bored actors, popping out of nowhere into nothing. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally managed to mean the thing without being the thing, so that what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, empty as a shell, but not even a shell, only the idea of ​​a shell. Could you ask for a better definition of forfeiture?
