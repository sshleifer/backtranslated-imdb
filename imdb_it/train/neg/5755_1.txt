I saw this film also at the screening of the High Falls Film Festival in New York and I must say that I found it a complete and terrible bore. Although it was fun in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to talk about and the acting in some places was terrible and wooden, especially the "Beautiful Lady" and the narrator's voice (which I don't have never heard of) had a lot to wish for. J.C.Mac was, I heard, the saving feature of this film, real action and determination and (out of the cast) the only real acting. I'm sure that with another cast and a closer realm on the reign, this could have been a half-decent movie. Let's just hope it's not released in general, or if you really want a copy, look in Lidl's business basket.
