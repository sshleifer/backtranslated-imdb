I've always liked Fred MacMurray, and although his career has been tragically interrupted, I think Carole Lombard is fun to watch. Pair these two important and attractive stars, add the best support players like Jean Dixon, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Lamour and Charles Butterworth, give them a romantic script, match it with the famous director Mitchell Leisen and get a mediocre cinematic experience. Skid Johnson (Fred) and Maggie (Carole) "meet cute" during his visit to the Panama Canal, and spend the next few weeks falling in love. Skid is a great trumpet player, so he embarks on a musical career, which is predictably meteoric in both autumn and autumn. During his ascent to the musical celebrity, he neglects Maggie, who later inspired him to start over after he hit bottom. Ah, yes, it's the real happy ending of Hollywood, which doesn't come too soon. <br /> <br /> Stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success, but this film is so predictable and slow that it is difficult to watch sometimes. The first scenes set in Panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever, and later an alcoholic Skid wanders endlessly in New York. Fred and Carole do their best, but the tired script and the S-L-O-W direction don't give them a chance. Even the final scene, in which Maggie encourages Skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment, does not seem true. <br /> <br /> This film should be seen once to see some early performances of MacMurray and Lombard stars. However, I guarantee that viewing will seem to take about 48 hours.
