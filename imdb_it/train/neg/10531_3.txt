This is kind of a genus, which means that you either like 50s musicals or not. If you do, you will like this. Personally, I prefer the 1930s and most of the 40s musicals with the dancing talents of Astaire and Rogers, Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple and so on, but the songs of the years 50, the slower the dance numbers and the soapy melodrama of the decade completely distracted me. <br /> <br /> This film is a success story. The first song was fine, but the next three did nothing for me. Since then, history has not had much appeal, either. Deborah Kerr's presence is another minus. I don't think I saw a movie that starred in what I liked, including this one, where the good English teacher with two shoes he portrays spends half of the film threatening to leave Siam. (Me that she had!). <br /> <br /> However, dividing myself from likes and dislikes, it cannot be denied that this production by Rogers and Hammerstein has a lot of appeal for many people, particularly those who have enjoyed "The Sound Of Music" a decade later. There are similarities in R & H musicals. So, if you liked the Julie Andrews movie, you should like it too. <br /> <br /> This is a sumptuous production with, yes, a capital "L". This is the kind of large-scale musical that you've rarely seen since that generation. You also have dubbed singers, unlike today, where the actress is unable to really sing so Marnie Nixon comes to save Kerr, as she did with Natalie Wood in "West Side Story" and Audrey Hepburn in "My Fair Lady ". "<br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is" King Mongkut "and he is the stereotypical traditionalist, the gentle directors always portray negatively. He is not" progressive ", as leftists say, but the education teacher (Kerr, as "Anna Leonowens") will make it clear. Today's secular progressives always place teachers higher than people trying to cure cancer! However, Yul is good at this role and also employs some comedies along with his character more to bark than to bite. Rightly, he is the great star of this film. Brynner had magnetism.Also on "The Magnificent Seven", Yul was the only cowboy who enchanted the audience. <br /> <br / > In summary, it's a good film for that day and millions of people enjoyed it.
