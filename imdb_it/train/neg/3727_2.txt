Written and interpreted by sincere amateurs, produced by some exploiter, this is boring and difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> Not the worst movie ever, but at least schlock like _Plan 9 From Outer Space_ usually had a real actor or two. I would recommend _A Thief In The Night_ only to the most ardent ironists and the irreducible Dispensationalists. I am neither. <br /> <br /> Don't believe me? Watch it for free (even if it comes from poor VHS) here: http://www.archive.org/details/Thief-In-The-Night <br /> <br /> Relevant links added mostly to reach line 10 of IMDb minimum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispensationalism http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/3199/thief-in-the-night-se-a/
