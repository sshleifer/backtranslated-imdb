The sequel to "Cleopatra Jones", from 1973, is the statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson who returns to her role as a chic and super-tough narcotics agent, who is challenging a heroin ring in Hong Kong here. Cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at the beginning, but in the end it's a flag. The ending of the film has just come off the assembly line, and the Dobson itself seems less energetic than before (it's still sexy, and gives a unique twist to her comic dialect, but these surroundings may have been too much of a thing for her - it's exhausted). This time Stella Stevens plays this time; she's good, but she can't match Shelley Winters in her predecessor. ** from ****
