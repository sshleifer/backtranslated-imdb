Keep reading and take note: you could save 88 minutes of your life (that was all!). <br /> <br /> Unbearably bleak, this film aims to produce (I imagine) a modern American Christmas fairy tale in the Capra style. If it fails .... completely and absolutely fails. I tried to think of a positive thing and I can't. Let me mention some of the highlights ... <br /> <br /> People don't die, they spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit on trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send them a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I don't want to ruin it for you, but there must be some light in the movies if only to counteract the darkness, but there is none. Even the photograph is bleak: the snow shows itself at the end of freezing, everywhere it seems cold, humid and miserable. <br /> <br /> As you can imagine, the film has a happy ending (schmaltzy). What a relief!
