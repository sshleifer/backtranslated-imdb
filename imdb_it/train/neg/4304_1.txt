This is an anti-Serbian propaganda film made for television. <br /> <br /> "Muslims are good, Orthodox Christian Serbs are BADs". <br /> <br /> This is the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to get through a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This film often puts it. <br /> <br /> And apparently many viewers and reviewers do it. <br /> <br /> I know better. <br /> <br /> The Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, saved 500 American leaflets shot down by the Germans in World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and to support British support for the communist Tito. Roosevelt followed the example and as a result, after the end of the war, Yugoslavia was handed over to the communist Tito. <br /> <br /> And the US ally Milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign designed by George Soros and his International Crisis Group (ICG) culminating in the "War" of Kosovo, in which Serbia was bombed by NATO due to false ICG claims of "mass graves" in Kosovo full of "victims" of bad Serbs The fact that there were no such mass graves and Albanians (Muslims) did not do business in Kosovo of Serbia are facts most of the media will not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this film to watch because the description of a sentence on the cover of the video seemed interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I found to have been tricked into hiring another branch of the propaganda machine for Serbia. <br /> <br /> this propaganda would have someone make a film about the Clinton administration's reluctance to head the Congress and with the American people of his own ability to deliver arms from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I won't wait for my breath waiting for a movie like that.
