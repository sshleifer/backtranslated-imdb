In the event that half of the movie in this movie is strangely familiar, it means you watch too much of this Italian charlatan stuff! For you, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this film, but he also took the liberty of reusing the most sadistic sequences of killings in his (and more easily traceable) "Cat in the brain". The opening scene, in which a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, is represented in Fulci's next film and so does another handful of murders and harrowing moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails miserably as a thriller, since the search for the sadistic killer among a film crew who is shooting a horror film is far from compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you like them low-shlocky horror movies. The incoherent script introduces a lot of repulsive characters who are all potential maniacs, but none of the forgeries that Biachi has in mind is plausible and you can point to the murderer almost immediately. All that remains to be enjoyed is the truly misogynistic make-up effects and the hilarious cast recitations. Whenever there is no bloodshed on the screen, like between the first and second murder, "Massacre" is slow and almost intolerable with its inhuman dialogues and completely heady photography. Fortunately in the second half, there are women who are impaled on fences and males who are repeatedly stabbed with rusty spikes. The music is crap and the use of shooting locations is really devoid of imagination. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned "Cat in the brain". That shows ALL the great moments of "Massacre", and then some.
