Hail Bollywood and male directors! <br /> <br /> Really this is the ultimate limit of the total sacrifice made by Indian Woman !! <br /> <br /> Visualization of the current state of things in India where wives are becoming more vicious day by day and are very possessive of their husbands - the Administrators ... can also be called Uncle Scars (read the film The Lion King) have devised a very new concept of how both the held and the wife can live happily ever after having shared everything between them ... including the spermicini !! <br /> <br /> Story line: married couple - very happy - but accidentally an accident occurs and the wife has a miscarriage - she lost the fetus with the ability to always become a mother! <br /> <br /> Now in India, laws generally banish the daughter-in-law if she can't give them an heir! So the wife catches an important plan - surrogate mother ... but the scientists intervened - "Certain artificial insemination" - NO the artist said (Director actually) - "The neighborhood will come to know that the daughter-in-law is sterile are going for surrogate mother !! <br /> <br /> The neighbors! the society! the same ones who watch the TV of fashion day and night - looking at the girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ... in bras and underpants - well those neighbors suddenly take over in family planning and decision-making !! <br /> <br /> SO his wife sends her husband away to a brewery where girls dance on stage - all mostly ignorant and illiterate - but men love women who can satisfy their ego a lot! <br /> <br /> He takes on the main dancer in the pub - he asks her to bring his baby - in exchange for money - he agrees - back at home - she becomes pregnant - wife and estate - both live together in st it home - in the meantime even the prostitute tastes a bit of home ife - there are so many caring people around - they all miss her and cries silently !! Meanwhile, no one in the family learns that the real daughter-in-law is hanging around with a pillow under her petticoat !! - the mother or other elderly people never took her to check-up - nor did they feel the baby's movements in her lap !!
