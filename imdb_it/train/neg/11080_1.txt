You have to love low budget movies. This comes complete with negative effects, props and bad acting (really bad). Also, every time I see Mercedes McNab (the sister) I keep thinking "Look out! It's a vampire!" - for those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste wants to waste money making a film, the small one that was spent, of course. I don't know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the film or the producer who didn't make money. <br /> <br /> I would say it's good for small children in its simplicity, but I don't know if I would like to submit a child to it ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because it's the lowest will go.
