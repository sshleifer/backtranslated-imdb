Oh my God, where to start ... this movie was just awful. The writing was bad, the acting was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie but I certainly didn't understand it! I thought it would be pretty decent since I wasn't picky. I've seen several bad horror movies. In fact, it's my goal to see all the horror movies, no matter how terrible they may be. At one point in the film I made a comment on the "corn syrup blood" and in the special features they admitted it was Karo syrup (commercial name corn syrup ...) The film had all the necessary things for a film of horror (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves) but completely missing anything to make it really good. The writer should take some lessons or just give up!
