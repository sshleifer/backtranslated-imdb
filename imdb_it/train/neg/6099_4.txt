This was a less than exciting short film that I saw recently in Turner Classic Movies. While the film came out due to its intense Technicolor, the film itself was not as moving and, at times, the plot seemed rather poor - as if it was made for classroom use and caught the attention of a wider audience NOT A consideration. In particular, I really hated how many times in the film things were repeated - like when the characters spoke to her, they usually said "Clara Barton" instead of "lady", "Miss Barton" or "Clara". Also, a sick Confederate soldier said he was a "Johnny Reb, a rebel Confederate, ..." - almost like he was the cartoon character Mojo Jojo of the Powerpuff Girls. It was just a period of sloppy writing. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see John Hamilton (later, "Perry White" on the SUPERMAN TV show) with a beard as President Garfield. Yes, he's under that beard.
