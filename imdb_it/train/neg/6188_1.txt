This is by far the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre I've seen. Not sure if the scriptwriter of the script ever read Bronte's book. George C Scott is ridiculous and mumbling like Rochester - when he is not simply an old actor who behaves angry. Susannah York has the most dated hairstyle of the 70s I've ever seen in a Victorian movie. The characters barely speak, so the rich exchange of jokes enjoyed in the book that is the basis for their profound intellectual and lasting love has disappeared. The ending is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Please rent Timothy Dalton's version. It's so true for the book, it's like the novel reads you out loud. Dalton is as superb as Rochester. G. C. Scott is ridiculous.
