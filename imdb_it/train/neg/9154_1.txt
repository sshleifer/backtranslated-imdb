THE. WORSE. MOVIE. NEVER. DONE. <br /> <br /> After watching this seemingly gay film, I suspect someone has gathered a half-blind neo-Nazi brain damaged and made him make the worst gay movie ever seen, all in an illusory attempt to attack the gay culture. I had to interrupt the movie and call a friend to come here, so I had someone to taunt when I paused the movie because of the shock, disbelief and indignation at such stupidity. <br /> <br /> On top of all the horrible plot and acting and the illogical and stupid plot, it's just a poorly made movie. A dog with a handycam attached to its tail could have churned out better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews of this film, I suspect the writer should have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says that this film is even watchable as something other than a joke, is a liar or is paid heavily to say it.
