My wife and I are almost enjoying ourselves from the Howie Mandel show .. I also like Shatner - even when it's in its most pathetic .. <br /> <br /> But this is absolutely the worst show on television. <br /> <br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks to **. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothes than Deal or No Deal ... <br /> <br /> The questions are a mix of way too easy and incredibly dark. And looking at Shatner or the competitor saying "Show me the money" makes me want to throw up .. <br /> <br /> This won't last.
