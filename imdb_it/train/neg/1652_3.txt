I'll be blunt and to the point. This film is not good at all. The part of the cinema of me hated acting, the script, the plot, the direction and almost all the editing. Amanda Peet proved to be able to act, as it was the highlight of "The Whole Nine Yards". So he should have avoided this movie with a ten-foot pole. However, the childish part of me found this film very funny. If you can forget how poor production quality is, and if you find funny smut jokes, then you should be fine. And for those of you who can't get off your pedestal, this is your choice. My inner child is not dead and I laughed a lot. Even then, only a 3 out of ten, because like a movie, it really stinks.
