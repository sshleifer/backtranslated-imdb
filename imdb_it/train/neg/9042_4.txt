I wanted to like this movie. But it falls apart in the middle. the whole premise is good and goes well, but the vehicle runs away tangent. The people I looked at annoyed as they ran off course, hoping it would end sooner than it did. Another person fell asleep during the middle segment! I found myself dreaming of the day elsewhere during the parts of Schtick that had nothing to do with the plot. I bought it for the eyes and gave it well, but Pixar's writing and soul are missing. I think children 8 and under will appreciate the vaule face stroke, while the plot is missing. Older enough people to follow a plot will find the wonders too far away to return quickly and easily. Edit most of the middle section, make it 50 minutes and it would be a solid hit. I wish I had better things to say. But not me
