After seeing the previews I felt that this film would be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series. So, I already expected him to have a missing storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of helpless owls with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a plot worse than all the media this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst film I have ever seen (I am kind - no I would not take the baseball bat in my dice like the others have said). Not only was the plot non-existent, but also the action was disgusting. I imagine the director thought they could just throw a bunch of exotic women and cars and then call them a movie. For an example, there is a point in the film where the boy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over an SLR McLaren to win. And after the piece in which Eddy Griffin quarreled with one of his "girls" (a comment from Imus would have worked in this case) the girl asks to pull over and leave the floor and of course they do it in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I can't take it anymore. So I saw only half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I've ever had. Later, I had to stop for a few drinks to kill all my damaged brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 1 because 0 is not an option. You'd better go to the local auto show and stop at a joint on your way home. I will keep all the spectators in my prayers.
