An incredibly confused, discouraging and ultimately ridiculous thriller ("horses, oh my God, horses!"). Sometimes it's scary, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for "resolution". Bland shows by the protagonists, a typically eccentric style by Richard Lynch. Video transfer is a real work of hacking, which cuts scenes in half and makes the film even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
