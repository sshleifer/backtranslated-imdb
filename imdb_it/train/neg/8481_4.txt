The acting was horrible and both sports were wrong ....... not only were they wrong about the rules of figure skating, but also the rules of ice hockey from GIRLS. GIRLS 'ice hockey can't control you. Also don't block for someone. Not all girls are gross and big disgusting. I play hockey and I only have 411 and I was asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Furthermore, not all hockey players hate skaters. A lot of hockey players of the current girls were once figure skaters themselves. We also skate much faster than those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie that gave people the idea that we suck ....... although I must mention that it is difficult to switch between sports due to the tip of your fingers on figure skates ..... even some of those moves that KAtelin was doing on the ice that could not be done in a normal hockey game. Basically he stumbled into the person, which is illogical. It is also unrealistic that you would get a HOCKEY scholarship when putting on your skates. This really made me angry that normally the scholarship was used by someone who could benefit the team.
