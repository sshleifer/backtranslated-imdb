I agree with all those who have said something that will convince you not to waste even a very short moment watching this incredibly amateur movie. The bad acting, the hasty production values, the absolutely pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane should never have been written, not to mention produced. Even Hollywood "professionals" apparently go to work only for a salary, although no one should be paid for this bad job. Careers should instead finish FINE on this insignificant massacre. <br /> <br /> OTH, there is something fascinating about looking at something so incredibly ugly. And Chad Lowe is terribly and constantly nasty.
