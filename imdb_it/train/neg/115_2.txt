Never put models or Playboy bunnies in your movies! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" on Dorothy Stratten, of which Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married his SISTER after his murder at the hands of her short husband, is a million times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the big screen. Patty Hansen is not an actress either. I expected to see a sort of lost masterpiece at Orson Welles, but instead Audrey Hepburn got her jeans and a bad "poodlesque" hairpiece ... Very disappointing .... "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" "I could look again and again. This clunker could barely sit once. This film was deemed not released due to the brutality surrounding Mrs. Stratten's terrible death; I think the real reason was because it was so ugly!
