Some years ago the same people who created Paris, J'TAIME., Which was imperfect but very funny (my vote was 7), created this piece of garbage for New York City. <br /> <br /> In Paris, I Love You (J'taime) created a feeling for Paris and was made in many parts of beautiful Paris. <br /> <br /> In this current film, I did not recognize New York, I did not feel that I was in the city of my birth. <br /> <br /> New York has 5 neighborhoods, I have not seen scenes in The Bronx, or Queens, there is a scene in Brooklyn, (Brighton Beach), I have seen no scenes in Times Square or Greenwich Village / None scene of beautiful hotels or theaters. He has a large cast, most of the performers were not even stereotypes, they were caricatures of the lowest kind. <br /> <br /> The very few humorous moments are all of a sexual nature or rather offensive to the many New Yorkers we all know and love .. <br /> <br /> Some of the films nominated for the "raids" awards they were far better. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) 20 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> In my thinking I think the title should have been <br / > <br /> NEW YORK, I HATE YOU.
