Certainly the product of young minds, this piece could very much attract the 20s crowd, which is still trying to find their place in the world, while being obsessed by every neurosis. However, I can't imagine that the heavy amount of narcissistic look down, trivial humor or trivial argument is particularly engaging for anyone over 30 years old. Another problem is that the peripheral characters, which the directors obviously have nothing but contempt for, are loaded on caricatures so absurd because of their comic effect, that they cannot be easily recognized. <br /> <br /> However, you need to give some style points to filmmakers, who have obviously grown up in video generation, and use every imaginable editing trick in the book to create an otherwise non-existent storyline. There are 2 points to remember here. First of all, pay attention to the darlings of the festival. Secondly, even if we live in the era of youtube, the account of none of their mundane lives deserves the big screen treatment. But these young directors have every right to make their film, and if other twenties can find something to identify with, then all the better. Yet I couldn't help thinking, at the end of this film, how this new generation, which is maturing, will face many challenges and complications in the real world. In the age in which every child is constantly reassured of how special they are and that everyone deserves the 15 minutes of exposure, the resilience and the ability to face adversity does not seem to be the strength of this generation.
