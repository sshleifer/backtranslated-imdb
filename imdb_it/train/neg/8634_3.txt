Seeing a picture of a man attacked by zombies gave me hope that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci could live up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, apart from the close-ups of a decomposing corpse, there is little to recommend in this story about the murder of a rich man and about finding his daughter to find out who killed him. None of the characters is attractive and when you find out how they did it (at least that was a good turnaround), stop worrying. The only good thing I can say is that it makes more sense than the Nightmare Concert!
