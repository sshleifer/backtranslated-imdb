I, too, having also endured hundreds of children's films in the past, consider this one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 1) I resent this day and age having to explain to my children that Russia is not "the bad guys". Furthermore, that derisory Russian name like "Poopchev" is inappropriate. <br /> <br /> 2) Grandpa Fly's birthday party scene contained a quasi-sexist joke that implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone. Also two other flies uselessly use the word "sucks" twice. <br /> <br /> 3) The entire film is largely inspired by the stereotypes and propaganda of the 1950s that I thought we, as a nation, were proud to have risen above. br /> <br /> In all it is just rough, badly animated, even more badly written and it is not worth wasting time to see it.
