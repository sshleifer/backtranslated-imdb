This was a horrible movie! I gave him 2 points, one for Angelina Jolie and a second for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... Apart from that, the story is simply sucked up and the cars whizzing through the cities weren't so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably the one that bothered me the most, I rarely saw something so built!
