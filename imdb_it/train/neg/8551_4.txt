It's 1982, two years after the siege of the Iranian embassy that involved the dramatic SAS Rescue of the Balconys, and with a war with Argentina in the Falkland Islands currently underway, what better film to make than an "SAS" movie of Gung-Ho who creates the siege of the Iranian hostage, while using the number one of the hero of the day Britains, Lewis Collins. throw Edward Woodward and a few other known actors and do you have a winner in your hands? ... Well, maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the acting is somewhat of a second level. it's like a long episode of the movie "The Professionals", but without the formula. This film is not going anywhere and is quite predictable. Perhaps Cubby Brocoli saw this film and decided to abandon Lewis Collins as a substitute for James Bond for Roger Moore. See if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS in general, if not, save time.
