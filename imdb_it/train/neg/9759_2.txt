It is rare that I feel the need to write a review on this site, but this film is very worthy because of how it was created wrong, and how wrong its product was. <br /> <br /> I heard a distinct attempt by the filmmakers to show the Palestinian family as evil and unreliable. We hear them discuss the sadness they feel about oppression, yet the film is shot and organized in such a way as to suggest that the politically oppressed population is the Israeli Jewish population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only have news of other Palestinians in prison. I understand that the restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions has been designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of the movie feeling that the victim's mother was selfish in her mourning and completely closed due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She still was not willing to see the bomber's parents' pain, and her angry and mentally closed words spiraled into the final encounter. It is more realistic in my mind to see the Israeli mentality as a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for recognition for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. <br /> <br /> I gave this two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which would normally be admirable in a documentary, but in light of the lack of impartiality, everything seems to be exploited. Also due to the bad changes, the lack of background in the concrete case and finally the lack of adequate representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor film and a poor film. I recognize that this is partly the result of the political situation, but I am obliged to note the defects in the direction regardless of the harrowing and sad themes.
