Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them - all 4 of us hated each other and spent all the time looking at our watches waiting for the movie to end. Half of the cartoons are bizarre, with very low entertainment value. There were few scenes of Paris - for example, I couldn't wait to see some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I couldn't really recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious and pseudo-intellectual films, don't miss this. If you're down on the ground like me, you'll regret seeing it.
