The Omega Code was a model of cinematic inconsistency. There was a little (but precious) good acting, mainly from the two prophets and Rostenberg, who appeared only once and had no lines. Otherwise the acting was definitely negative. The plot was rather weak and only partially based on an already debatable biblical interpretation. Definitely not one of the best of the year.
