I didn't like this movie. I thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. A 20-year-old computer that saved the day? I thought it was a bit exaggerated, even for a movie. I couldn't understand why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a hammer. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, but after the original 1980s movie you were expecting much more than what was actually delivered. This film could have been a version of the old 21st century film, it was not. If this is what you want to watch, don't watch this movie! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer hadn't appeared to save the day, this would still, in my opinion, be a very baffling film.
