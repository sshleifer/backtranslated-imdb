Rex Reed once said of a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be precise) that seemed to have been shot through pomegranate juice. This occurred to me while I was snoring through Purple Butterfly. This seemed to have been turned through gauze. <br /> <br /> The story was boring and it was not helped that for large parts of the scenes the faces of the actors were literally blurred or concentrated only after long periods of time. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, everyone seemed the same, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. I call this syndrome of the "dead poets syndrome". <br /> <br /> There was no one to import to, no one to be interested in dramatically, and the film did not shed light on a period of time and set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
