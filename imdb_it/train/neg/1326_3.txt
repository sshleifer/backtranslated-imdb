Dribbling without thoughts on the second coming of Christ in the form of a hippie and an albino watching Sandra Locke. You have no idea what is happening on the screen with the irritating song "Suzanne" being played again and again throughout the film until "The Second Coming of Suzanne" is over, you know it already from hard, no matter how much you try to forget it all. <br /> <br /> This Logan unconventional armor filmmaker, Jared Martin, is out to make the film of the century but is so rude and hateful that no one in the banking world is willing to finance his project. He plans to go to Logan alone, then sees this couple in a seaside cafe and is fascinated by the young woman Suzanne, Sandra Locke, who reminds him of someone she knew in another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> With Logan's assistant and all around Gofer Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, somehow getting a loan of $ 740,000.00 from the bank to finance Logan's masterpiece, starts working on Suzanne by flattering her of her talent as an actress to get her interested in her film. This leads to Suzanne not only leaving her boyfriend artist Simon, Paul Sand, but later Simon is so depressed and feeling all alone takes a gun to his mouth and blows his brains out. <br /> <br /> The film also has two somewhat unrelated subtitles that have to do with a young autistic Dorothy, Kari Avalos, who recovered from her autism from Suzanne after everyone else, at the hospital psychiatric to which it had been entrusted, they failed. It is not known exactly what Suzanne was doing exactly at the hospital, but it seemed to be sort of orderly or voluntary there; should this show us in the audience that she, like Jesus, could miraculously heal the sick? <br /> <br /> There is also this newspaper columnist and big-time businessman tycoon Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry, who seems to be going through a very difficult mid-life crisis or saw a vision biblical that changed his life forever. Sinclair was looking for the meaning of life and what is everything in the film and wanted to know why there is all this suffering in the world, as in this film in which it is found, and seemed to have found the answer when he first laid eyes on Suzanne. Sinclair also made sense in his head when his private driver David, Mark Rasmusser, who got sick and tired of his strange and crazy hallucinations, almost knocked him off a cliff into a kamikaze like a walk along the coast of Pacific. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Second Coming of Suzanne" continues with a number of unrelated sequences, probably to be filled or filled at some point by its director and editor, and then to go to its final scene in a crucifixion similar to Christ on a hill while Logan has all the rolling cameras. It turns out that the mad Logan was so carried away with his masterpiece as he tried to replicate, on the unhappy and tied up Suzanne, the actual crucifixion of Jesus Christ some 2,000 years ago. <br /> <br /> Difficult to sit through and almost impossible to follow "The Second Coming of Suzanne" puts you in touch with the same torture that Suzanne was subjected to Logan and the film's creators. The film tries to be arty but this is just an excuse to hide the brainless and non-existent plot and even worse for everyone's terrible and amateur acting.
