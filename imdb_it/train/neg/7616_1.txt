The good news is that a film was made, drawing on a supposed Aztec myth and characterized by an unusually Aztec-American cast (there is a word like that). The bad news is that she died at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood had left the boarding house and had trained George Romaro in his classic "Night of the Living Dead", this is what we could have with. "The Legend of Diablo" is clearly a fodder for any future resurrection of "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> I don't think we can define a "B" movie. The production values ​​are so abysmal that I continued to perceive that I was looking at a long scene of a variety show or an 8 mm film in the courtyard filmed by a group of school children. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot seemed interesting enough to make me rent it. A rural California sheriff finds a box containing an Aztec demon and accidentally unleashes it in the unsuspecting community. His daughters, a hot and the only housewife, with an FBI gringo and a priest, try to reconcile the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene I've ever seen in previous undead films is badly reproduced. These zombies walk more like an army of crazy professors than undead! The alleged infrared scenes from the demon's point of view are nothing special ?? and he / she / she certainly seems to support a lot (as opposed to turning around progress). And the scene where the priest draws the demon out of the fast-moving cave is ridiculous! It really looks like it looks really made for comic effect, even though I know it wasn't! I kept expecting that Benny Hill's theme music would start playing and the whole zombie band would start chasing the priest all over the beach! <br /> <br /> Obviously the voice of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, which calls the FBI agent becomes decidedly comical. Then again, so was most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and screenwriter of the script, should win SOMEthing for this effort! (How about a blackballing for life, like the "Hollywood 10?") This, I see now, is rated 1.5 on a 10 scale. I'm afraid this might be a little generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty sexy like the dead sheriff's younger daughter. That's probably why his older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is quite decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who launched for the Cincinnati Reds? If so, he should have remained loyal to the baseball. In fact, they couldn't have done worse if they went with a baseball theme and called it "Demons in the Outfield!" <br /> <br /> If I find out that this was actually a project for a college community cinema class, I will apologize. It might be good enough for a B or even B + as long as the band restarts the college video camera on campus in one piece! "The Blair Witch Project" showed that a cool and catchy film could be made with little money. "The Legend of Diablo", however, does not seem to have a pair of shoes to work from! It was low-budget, low-talent, low-everything. The last scene - and I mean the last 10 seconds of the film - is the ONLY slightly creative or interesting moment. <br /> <br /> I paid $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have better spent it on a burger!
