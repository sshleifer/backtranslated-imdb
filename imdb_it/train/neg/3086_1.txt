Once I thought "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. The "Hobgoblin" surpassed him in every way I could imagine and some I couldn't. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity. I will not include a teaser for this film, I am not so cruel. I could not subject innocent people like you to this torment. In fact, any discussion of the plot about this film is meaningless and demeaning. The words I would use to describe this film are the following: insipid, asinine and naive. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, PLEASE, don't watch this movie. Please, from one movie lover to another ... no, from one human being to another, PLEASE. For the sake of your health and intelligence DON'T LOOK. Destroy all the copies you meet.
