Well, where do I start? I think it's very offensive to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie and I expected this to be a fantastic movie, but I was so disappointed! the acting is horrible, the original Annie came out a few years before I was born, now I'm 25 and Annie is still one of my favorite movies, so I was really excited to see Annie 2. The acting was terrible in the movie, someone was the characters original? very poorly written, directed and recited. This is not a movie I would like to see again, and any Annie lover I recommend you don't watch this movie because it will leave you very disappointed. The girls who sing is not bad, but it is not comparable to the original
