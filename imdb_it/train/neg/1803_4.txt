Here is one of those educational short films made to learn unknown people out there about the facts of life. This time the target audience is pre-adolescent girls, the fact of life is the menstrual cycle. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsorships from Kotex. <br /> <br /> Start by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, the uterus and the vagina, work and why all this leads to menstruation. It's almost surprising, becoming the comic note here, as we avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned even if "stolen" will pass once. I really don't know why I saw it, but since it's one of those rare short films that could give the impression of an innocent time, you might want to try.
