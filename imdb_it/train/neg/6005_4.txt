This is a classic stinker with a cast of big names, mostly older people who were way beyond their first and bedtime time in this. <br /> <br /> This is a rather depressing movie when you think about it. Stay on the earth, and you will face the disease and eventually your disappearance. <br /> <br /> Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. Too bad the film doesn't focus on this anymore. Maureen Stapleton, apparently distorted, still showed those passages from "Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom", much more down to earth than 10 years earlier. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide at Jim Jones level. How can anyone be stupid enough to like this and say it makes you think? <br /> <br /> Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If the elders did a wonderful thing in the end, why was the boy encouraged to leave the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump on the ship too? After all, he had found his love-lady. <br /> <br /> It would have been a good film if the elders had managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at the time of writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and the gentleman know who else left. The screenwriters should have taken the script and also put it into this group.
