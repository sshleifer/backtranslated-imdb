What a stinkeroo turned out to be !!! Once, long before his career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - not great frills as an actress, but very nice and pleasant (especially in films like "The Mark of Zorro" and "Blood and Sand"), but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of his golden days faded quickly. The story is incredible and farcical, the second-rate acting, the unbearable supporting cast. I can't think of an acerbic performance than anyone compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring man they could have chosen. Added to this, it was the terrible photograph (and I am not referring only to color!) All associated with this, they must have shivered every time it was shown.
