I saw this movie during an interim lecture at Tolkien during my second year of college. Unfortunately I sat close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a scapegoat - everyone else laughed, but they weren't in constant sight. <br /> <br /> Let's stop: Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films owe something to the Bakshi movie. For example, in Jackson's version of The Fellowship of the Ring, the scene in which the Black Riders assault the inn's empty beds is almost a complete copy of Bakshi's film scene, shot by shooting. You can call this plagiarism or tribute, depending on your agenda. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the similarities don't stop there. I won't do any research to find out what they are, because that would imply some respect for this movie. I'm sure others have outlined the similarities - look around. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete train disaster in every sense of the metaphor, and many, many people died in the accident. I decided to list what I can remember in a more or less chronological way: if I omitted something else that offended me, it is because I am completely overwhelmed, confronted with a wealth of failures (and, at the highest moments, mediocrity). <br /> <br /> * Due to the intensive use of rotoscoping, Gandalf is no longer a wise and wise magician, but a proponent of misfortune (whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film) . ). <br /> <br /> * Saruman the White is sometimes referred to as "Aruman" during the film, without explanation. Wear purple and red for some mysterious reason. <br /> <br /> * Sam is flat and horrible. The portrait of his friendship with Frodo is strangely childish and unsatisfactory. Yes, hobbits are as small as children, but they are NOT children. <br /> <br /> * Merry and Pippin are never introduced - they simply appear during a scene change with an explanation of a sentence. The film is full of sloppy editing like this. <br /> <br /> * Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are happily singing while jumping along the road. One of the hobbits procures a lute at least twice as big as it has behind its back - which was not visible before - and starts playing with the typical bardo fantasy as they break into "la-la-la". TRUE. <br /> <br /> * Aragorn, apparently, is a Native American dressed in an extremely stereotyped fantasy tunic (without pants), complete with a huge square pilgrim's belt buckle. Probably the worst swordsman in the whole film - he often has a shaky swing before being rammed in the ass. <br /> <br /> * The Black Riders seem more leprous than threatening instruments of evil. They limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace. This is disturbing to be sure, but not scary. <br /> <br /> * The scene before the Black Riders attempt to cross the Ford of Bruinen (in which they look at Frodo, who is on the other side on horseback) goes on forever, during which the Knights raise their horses in a vaguely threatening way and ... do nothing else. The scene was probably designed to illustrate Frodo's hallucinatory decline as he succumbed to his wound. It turns out to be more tiring than anything else. <br /> <br /> * Gimli the Dwarf is as tall as Legolas the Elf. It's a DWARF. There is simply no excuse for this. He also looks like a bastard David David the Gnome. It is a rough but accurate description. <br /> <br /> * Boromir seems to have stolen Elmer Fudd's golden armor from that Bugs Bunny episode. Seems ridiculous. <br /> <br /> * Despite the resemblance to Tolkien's illustration, the Balrog is the howling that induces and the least threatening villain in the entire film. He looks like a person wearing pink bedroom slippers, and is barely taller than Gandalf. The "Purists" may prefer this Balrog, but I'll take Jackson's version every day. <br /> <br /> * The battle scenes are embarrassing and embarrassing. Almost none of the characters show any skill level with their weapons. I'm not asking for action-packed scenes like those in Jackson's movie, but they're supposed to be fighting. <br /> <br /> * Treebeard makes a very brief appearance, and I was disappointed that he took the trouble to introduce himself to everyone. Watch the movie, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Ok, now for the GOOD parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> * Some of the voiceovers are quite good. It's not Aragorn SOUNDS bad, it looks a bit like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> * Galadriel is a bit interesting in this portrait; like Tom Bombadil, he seems immune to the Ring's temptation powers, and even his actress is not horrible. <br /> <br /> * Boromir's death is not as heartbreaking as in the Jackson portrait of the same scene, but it's still justly dramatic (and more faithful to his death in the book, though I don't think Jackson committed a mistake in resuming it as he did). <br /> <br /> * As my professor (between whispered threats) pointed out, the orcs (mainly Helm's Deep, if I am right) resemble the corpses of war-ravaged soldiers, a political statement that works quite well if you realize what you are trying. <br /> <br /> * Although this is not a positive aspect of the film, Bakshi cannot be blamed for most of the failures in this film, or so I was told - the project had a limited budget, and late in his production he lost the creative control of some of the biggest (which I'm sure I hadn't read the books). <br /> <br /> I would like to be clear: I respect Bakshi for trying to do something of this magnitude. I simply find it hard to believe he was happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> In general, I cannot in any way recommend this blasphemous adaptation of Tolkien's classic trilogy even for laughter, unless you have already read the books and have your views of the characters, places and events. I'm sure someone, somewhere, will get a confused copy of it; if you do, keep an open mind and glean the good you can from it.
