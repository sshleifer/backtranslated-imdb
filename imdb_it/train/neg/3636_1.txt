I am very open to foreign films and I like to think of understanding what they are trying to achieve, even if some things are lost in the translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I have often thought how interesting it would be to make a film that shows only a typical day or period of time that really didn't make sense. Now that I've seen a movie like that, I won't think any longer. There are tones on society, racism and some desire ... but South Park has this. And when I look at South Park, it actually moves me to feel an emotion. The closest thing I felt to an emotion during this film was the yawn I experienced after the first five minutes. I consider the typical film of seven or more, because I love most films. I gave this movie one.
