Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights I sailed on the canals and entered this stinking movie. For some of the names in the cast, I would expect a much better film. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar Winner F. Murray Abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. I mean, it's fenced off, it's a fun sport, but I've never been this intense. The only reason I even watched the whole movie is because the remote control fell under the couch and I was too lazy to get it back.
