was this the first acting role in a movie? the character, leon, is quite funny, but soon after the jokes and sexual humor are too stupid to listen to him. some films manage to get away with sexual jokes and base their audiences on what is right when the commercial comes. some movies that do this are American movies and scary movies. the scary movie was stupid, and the American pie wouldn't have gone well without the sexual jokes. the only role, besides Leon, which had a certain humor that followed was ferrell. the character was really stupid and that was all, the mute humor was all that made me look. the film was ok, and nothing else. I really don't understand why people who are dying to leave the show always get a movie based on a character they played on the show. the scenes last about 5 minutes and if they can make a film from a 5-minute scene, then what world is it coming from? Molly Shannon had a superstar, cheri o'terri had a scary movie, but he was not a protagonist and would have had an elf. but it was fine, but he made a stupid movie, but I don't remember, and mike myers with the world of Wayne. How come the crazy TV crew never gets film offers? saw only one guy break through, but only in like 2 movies and a TV show with andy dick. but that boy relies on comedy to continue his life, amusing or not. this film is not good, but has some positive humor. what a waste of films and people's money.
