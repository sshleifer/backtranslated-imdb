the only value in this film is basically to laugh at how bad it really is. with a plot that makes the average medium writer look good, and the acting that is almost as good, gets my lowest score. one of Tom is very busy in movies where he obviously didn't have the pleasure of being really picky. The film's best special effect is a guy dressed in an incredibly fake rubber monster.
