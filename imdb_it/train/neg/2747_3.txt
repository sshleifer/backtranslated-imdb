I knew it would happen, but I gave him a rent for some laughter and maybe some carefree fun. Anyone who has read some of my reviews can see that they are easy enough to please. I didn't really think that I would end up feeling negatively towards it. <br /> <br /> The plot is about an ancient army of dragons driven by a huge snake that will destroy the world unless some chosen heroes who have inherited the responsibility can ?? become one with ?? a good dragon ?? or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I didn't bother to put much effort into keeping it. <br /> <br /> It is characterized by a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and silly concepts. So many of the events felt totally random and sudden. I suppose there was interference in the studio or something like that because the biggest problem I have with the film is the fact that the story seems to be trying to be so great and epic, yet everything happens so fast and passes so quickly. I feel like I've been hit by a million points in the plot and action sequences in one big ball. The film is like a punch in the face. It doesn't take long to establish characters or dramas. Imagine the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy in 90 minutes ?? You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no accumulation and you would hardly be interested in the outcome of those battles. Was it the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes of me not giving a shit, waiting for it to end. <br /> <br /> CGI fantastic with some good direction, but the horrible acting, the fast pace and the stupid story made this thing very difficult to enjoy for any reason. I probably would have liked when I was 6 years old.
