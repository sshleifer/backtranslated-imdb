Bela Lugosi plays a doctor who will do everything to keep his wife young and beautiful. To that end, he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make them look like they're dead so they can steal their bodies. I'm not exactly sure what he does with bodies. I don't remember that it was ever completely explained. All I know is that he pulls something out of them and injects it into his wife. (I only guess it's spinal fluid, spinal fluid was the rage of mad scientists in the 1940s.) You can pretty much guess the rest from here. <br /> <br /> There are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but I'll write just about two) of the problems I have with this movie. One is the way Bela is used. Of course, he does a pretty decent job in his exaggerated way (BTW, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). But hiding it in the back of a hearse or crawling into the journalist's bedroom to do nothing is simply silly. Also, why make him beat and / or kill any of his henchmen? Does it make you look wicked? Well, someone who's kidnapping coma doesn't really need to be done to look worse. <br /> <br /> The second problem I have is the idea of ​​peddling drugs. Why brides? Wouldn't any woman under the age of 20 do it? Watching Bela go through these rotations to get his victims, I was reminded of the idiot Fisherman in I Still So What You Did Last Summer. In any case, it would seem to be an easier way to reach your goal than to use a seemingly impossible plan that depends a lot on the circumstances beyond your control. (By the way, an alternative title for this film is The Case of the Missing Brides. I suppose you partly explain the need for "brides".)
