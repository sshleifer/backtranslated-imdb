Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their little son Alex to spend a couple of days with his family on Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple expects to solve their problems over the weekend on the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of penniless hilly lives on the island. The reckless Peter smoke pot driving the truck at night and turning off the headlight to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage family, but in the dark he thinks he hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as compensation for their lost son. The Young family does not accept trade and begins a deadly war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low budget film, with a stupid script, an amateur cinematography but a surprisingly good acting. The imperfect story is totally absurd and there are many incredible situations. For example, how could two men leave two women with the child alone on the street during the night with the threat of an unbalanced family? The logical procedure would go immediately to the continent and bring the police to save Peter. Then the young family vanishes; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent, their home and friends, and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat at the beginning. There are so many flaws in this movie that I could spend many lines writing about this topic. I think this movie was shot with such a terrible home video camera. The good cast deserved better material to work. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Island of Blood")
