Average viewers who seek a sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give it a pass. It generates the same feeling of staring at a curious series of individual images that seem to have a relationship to one another, but never to merge into a totality. <br /> <br /> While this isolation approach to the creation of a sort of film montage could appeal to a few students or critics immersed in the inner language of contemporary cinema, it is decidedly irritating and condescending to us ordinary citizens who have just fallen from flying cart. Openly avoiding accessibility could be the intentional hallmark of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but it happens to me that Andy Warhol has warmed up. The only saving feature that I find is in production values, and they are not going to cut everything by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and anxiously and vainly await some clever development of an idea or thought to support all the extraordinary and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. Calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to move. I have the same great yawn and disappointment reading what I imagine are very thorough and in-depth comments on this film that never lead to anything truly understandable. Ideas and images without an external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a Philistine who wanders the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
