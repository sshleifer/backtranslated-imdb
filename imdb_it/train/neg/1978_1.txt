Pathetic is the word. Bad acting, pathetic script, cheeky dialogue and hip hop and fashion music ... what the hell was going on? The direction of this film is as bad as the film he made. If someone had taken the time and effort to rework the whole thing, he could have a chance. I bet the studios are still trying to figure out how they could get so bad. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is Stacey Dash ... the Asian girl wasn't so bad. These girls also brought the whole movie. If it wasn't for them I would have destroyed my copy of this film. <br /> <br /> If any of those who haven't seen it yet and had a notion of it, don't waste time ... you will only regret it later.
