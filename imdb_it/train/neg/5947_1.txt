This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately, I was led not to do so, since the presence of Donald Sutherland has deceptively given a certain credibility. [This is the last time this will happen.] <br /> <br /> The character of Lesley Ann Warren was annoyingly whiny and stupid like them. There were smarter characters than those who were killed in the film. This is just one of the many things in this film that made me ask, "Where is justice?" <br /> <br /> Why is the night cable full of sadistic garbage full of pathological chaos? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women and seem to focus on them being terrified and killed. This film could have been just as full of suspense without being sick and twisted in the process. All he ends up doing is transforming the viewer's stomach with his illness and insulting the viewer's intelligence. <br /> <br /> The cast is misleading. My hypothesis is that they have BAGGED Sutherland first, and they used it to attract others like lemmings in this. <br /> <br /> I'm kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of junk a chance.
