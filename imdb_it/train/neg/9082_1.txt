This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was tricked into thinking that it could be fine because there are a couple of my favorite actors. Now I want to punch Jason Schwartzman in the face for taking this role. I was physically sick after watching this movie. Sometimes I really don't understand Hollywood. There are so many people trying to intrude that I'm sure you can skim the top and get the best. In this way the worst movie you make is equivalent to Ferris Beullar instead of this mud. The gags like the hair doll and brazenly tear off the jeans commercials added to the film's humor. I'm glad I avoided this movie and saw it on TV. This shows that you should avoid the January releases at all costs.
