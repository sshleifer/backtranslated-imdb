How can an Ozzy Osbourne movie and still suck? I just don't understand. Trick or treat managed to do it. This sucks and pleases. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat is one of those films that I have to warn people about. It's a vile atrocity that induces vomiting and just asks to be seen, so you can feel a lot worse than yourself. Trick or treat has no redemption factors. <br /> <br /> For a heavy metal film, it certainly doesn't seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film manages to make the heavy metal style unpleasant and this happened in 1986, probably one of the strongest hours of heavy metal. It is rather an undertaking, however negative. <br /> <br /> Trick or treat = so bad you will be angry with yourself for having seen it. It is hoped that this simple equation will keep you away from this mindless and unscrupulous film.
