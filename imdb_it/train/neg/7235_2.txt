Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a raft of good actors, can save this poorly written attempt at comedy in wartime, since its patented timing has very little to do. The plot involves a Hollywood movie star, Don Bolton (Hope), and his attempt to escape military service at the start of World War II, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confusing attempt to woo a colonel's daughter (Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, played by Eddie Bracken, he enlisted with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, shot in Malibu, California, on the hills. Paramount has budgeted beautifully for this effort, employing some of its best specialists, but the direction of the usually reliable David Butler was flabby, and this must be attributed to a missing comic element in the scenario. A shift towards the end of the film to create an opportunity for Bolton's heroism is still born with poor acrobatic work and prominent photographic actions. Strangely, Lynne Overman is given the best jokes and this veteran sneer master does them a lot of good. Dorothy Lamour is adorable and behaves well, and it's always a pleasure to see and listen to Clarence Kolb, like his father, whose voice is unique on screen or on the radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, damn com 'is with an error in the script assignment.
