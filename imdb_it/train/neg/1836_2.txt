How does Barry Levinson assemble white comedians like Ben Stiller and Jack Black, the beautiful Rachel Weisz, the old pro Christopher Walken and still able to offer such a stink without humor? <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are friends until the very end invents a spray to make the dog mess vanish and become a conspicuous multimillionaire. <br /> <br /> The locals are thin but good enough in the right hands for being a springboard for some big bitch between the two stars but everyone worried overwrite every hand, every chance they can. <br /> <br /> Stiller and Black are not just fun for too long, Weisz looks as sensational as ever but is abused and, with the exception of Walken as a whine that drives Stiller's character to revenge, is a turgid race towards the end of this tense farce.
