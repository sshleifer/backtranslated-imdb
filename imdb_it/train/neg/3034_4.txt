This film has a large number of great adult stars, but it fails to interest you in an adult film. Of all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes. The film is shot in a dream like middle-aged set that is embarrassing cheesy. The acting is worse than that of Keanu Reeves, sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbors talking about their child at university, and dialogue is the worst I saw in a movie. The plot was even worse than ten times. I would limit myself to the amateur course. The audio commentary was useless since it was a leather movie, but even so it was also bad. Unless he's a diehard fan of Jenna Jameson, there's little here. 4/10
