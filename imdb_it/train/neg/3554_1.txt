I rented it in the 80s and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - it's just the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of those "it was so bad, it was fun." This is not one of those films "it was so bloody, it leaves you with a bad feeling". It wasn't even one of those "what the hell was it?" movie. I can't remember the actors' performance, but it was badly resumed, the plot was disjointed and had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry because I had lost time. <br /> <br /> I have seen many films that I do not understand due to unknown cultures, styles and / or narratives, but it was clear that those films had some of those properties. The nightmare has none. <br /> <br /> Actually I thought NOT to make a comment on this "piece" for fear that someone might look at it out of curiosity, but I have to warn anyone who appreciates the film to skip this movie.
