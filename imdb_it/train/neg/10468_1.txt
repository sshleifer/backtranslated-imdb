I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. This was a really terrible movie. The script, direction and acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could have created an intelligent and inspiring film, but he didn't. I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so ugly. Where was the focus on the film? Where was there something in this movie? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was hurt and a waste of money. Don't see this movie.
