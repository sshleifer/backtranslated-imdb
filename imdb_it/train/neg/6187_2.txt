This was soon a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was horribly clumsy; I did not feel any feelings behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines have been delivered too hastily and you feel rather out of place. They could also be mentioned by the statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and looking at an American Rochester seemed strange. He could at least try to make a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but it just didn't work. I seemed to be looking at the highlights of Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story had been put together randomly, regardless of the flow of history. The scenery and the music were all very beautiful, but I could not perceive the passion and love that were supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the film left me totally indifferent. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good movie Jane Eyre version I suggest you watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton. Now these two are brilliant adaptations.
