The man at the end of this film is so terribly unwatchable and dated that my whole film aesthetic class laughed like crazy. Now most of the rest of the film was fine. He had some unintentionally funny scenes, but had some good shots and camera changes. Yes, Alderich is a great director who has made FLIGHT OF THE Phoenix and Whatever Happened TO Baby Jane. The problem is not with management, acting or anything technical. The film was just destroyed in the third act. Why? Have the murders, the plot twists, the turns and the characters all rotated around the NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What on earth was the writer smoking when he invented it? The way it comes out of nothing may have been the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For all the complaints about Burton's Planet of the Apes, the life of David Gale or Notorious, I think this is the worst ending ever. What a disappointment.
