Even the first 10 minutes of this film were horrible. It is hard to believe that anyone other than John Cusack would put money into this. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films already destroyed at the box office, it is almost inconceivable that a studio of any kind wants to associate itself with this script. <br /> <br /> At first, it may have seemed like a kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But only about 90 seconds into the film, it becomes obvious that this is a talentless attempt by DR STRANGELOVE. I loved the Cusacks movies so much that I thought I'd risk seeing the DVD of it. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is healthy enough to let me see another function that will see it again unless someone else can guarantee it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred of George Bush and the war in Iraq that he is willing to commit career suicide. Tom Cruise was never close to being that far away. Not even close.
