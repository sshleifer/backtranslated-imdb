Despite a few moments in the pouring rain, a meeting with a drunk and an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanatorium, this silent comedy "Fatty" Arbuckle short with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St. John is funny only if there is a fun enough sequence of Arbuckle in dragging flirt with Buster that is the ultimate in "meeting cute scenes", especially since it is one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in movies ! Moreover, many scenes seem to have been modified, probably due to the excessive use of the film. Anyway, if you're a Arbuckle or Keaton outfit, Good Night, Nurse! it's definitely worth a look
