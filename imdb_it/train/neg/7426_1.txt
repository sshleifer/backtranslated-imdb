I could not believe. I had to massage myself a couple of times. Was it true? <br /> <br /> Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins - everyone has some kind of talent but here they were all in what basically adds up to a Cinemax style movie set on a spaceship! <br /> <br /> Sad as it is, "Alien Intruder" tries to be unique, with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / whatever you want to call it Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrating this sort of reality station virtual high-tech on board a spaceship in which four men are allowed to live out their fantasies while the system is dominated by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Maybe, but here everything takes place like a well-stuffed episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams outlasts the classes all right, and it seems he'd rather do anything else, EVERYWHERE. Ah, the things that people do for money .... <br /> <br /> FX's are quite static, maybe even less than you'd expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this. Unfortunately, female nudity is also less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the real star here and, of course, gets ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that is all teasing and mindless, take a look at "Alien Intruder". Of course, you will probably have to watch Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. <br /> <br /> No stars, not even as regards the power of the star that this film can muster. <br /> <br /> Leave this lost in space.
