I'm sorry I bought this series. I expected more action, a more objective and more consistent image. This is just a pure propaganda series, very obscure, without any charm or romanticism, it's just boredom itself. I find that even the actors work fairly weak. O'Donnell may sound as fascinating as Robin (with Batman), but in this photo he has no charm. Probably as he grows older he loses his childish charm but acquires no adult charm. Not surprisingly, it has not been shown in many countries and is sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.
