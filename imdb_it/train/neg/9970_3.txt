People who really liked Problem Child (1990) need to be examined. Who would take the idea of ​​watching an evil kid devastate others and feel it amusing? The film is not funny, never, in any way, from beginning to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people are attacked by bears or hit with baseball bats. It could be fun in cartoons, but not in a movie. <br /> <br /> The young hero of the film is Junior (Michael Oliver) who, since he was a child, has been placed at the doors of adoptive parents for adoption. Families reject it, because Junior tends to give them some time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he frightens the nuns and writes letters of pen to the condemned Bow-Tie Killer (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child, to be just like any other parent in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of the Healy family, and the "little" Ben is interested in him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by attracting a bear on the site, or throw a cat to his father " Big "Ben (Jack Warden), a bigoted politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of Junior so that we can take root for him when he gets his revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, her grandfather is completely selfish, and a little girl - who despises adopted children - is a spoiled girl. <br /> <br /> But what Junior does to get the last laughs are not fun - it's mean, cruel and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the message of the film? That children should solve problems with violence and vandalism? Who should seek friendship by writing to convicted murderers? Surely they are not what it is like to be a bad child. Junior is not one - he is just a sadistic, little boy. There was a time when it was wrong for children to beat others. Now, everyone laughs when Junior beats the kids with a baseball bat. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this film was marketed as a "family comedy". What's worse is that Problem Child is rated PG. What did the MPAA think when they saw it? There are a lot of curses and tricks from petty spirits here, which may be asked what is the division between PG and PG-13. Children will have fun, but parents will be shocked by what is shown on the screen. And for many people, Problem Child will be considered a "guilty pleasure" classic; a film that some will shamefully admit to appreciate, even if the prevailing opinion, expressed by more serious viewers, is that the film is a piece of shit.
