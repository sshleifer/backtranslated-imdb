Vampires n. 1 against humans <br /> <br /> # 2 Team roughneck that rejects the military as first responders to dangerous and unknown Vampire raids. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy female vampire on the side of "good guys. <br /> <br /> # 4 Lots of blood and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4 ) main plot devices that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, then the next plot device may not discourage you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In outer space. <br /> <br /> The latter almost took me too, but I'm glad I looked in. In a pile of terrible horrors directed at the video that is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will line up against any other offer from the Sci-Fi channel, and also against the other Vampire film that Natassia played (which continues to give Uwe Boll the money?).
