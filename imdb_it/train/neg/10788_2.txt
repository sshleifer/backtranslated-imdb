And I mean ultra light. This film features four giant stars, about three jokes and nothing beyond. <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this stinker, other than that even though it has a couple of really good bits, most of it isn't very funny. Nor does it work like a love story. What about a romantic comedy? Not in your life. Most dialogues are too flat to be sophisticated, much less fun. <br /> <br /> What is really ashame is that the premise is not bad at all. This film could have been much more, especially with the recent focus on some of the false ways in which films are promoted, complete with false quotes from critics. The film reveals the undermined territory of the press junction: those expenses paid for journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes, he spends about three minutes on this territory and searches for the film's limping novel. Same with Catherine Zeta-Jones "character - the slim and self-centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what was given to her, but gave her practically nothing. It's all homogenized stuff that seems very pale compared to some of the things we've heard about the stars over the years. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship, which sinks like a replica of "The Love Boat". In fact, as the old joke says, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably be a better story. So go ahead and tell us, filmmakers , what do you have about these stars that made them appear in this?
