I grew up with scooby (a bit like the re-runs of where you are) I hate scrappy, I love Daphne, and I feel that it's not complete with the whole band. But this is sad, scooby doo is a comedy to solve mysteries, not bad for the totally displaced spy. I like "what's new", they had to give Daphne a danger-prone tendency sometimes :( and try to lose the drug * sexual jokes of many generations, but this "having a clue" is lousy and shouldn't have the name of Scooby attached. They also tried to do something loky punk with the theme song theme. Now I'm going to see my scooby doo dvd where you're going to wash the dirt of this new series from my eyes
