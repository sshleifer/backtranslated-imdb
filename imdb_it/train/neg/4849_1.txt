I just rented it today .... I heard many positive reviews in advance. WOW !! What a bunch of steaming poop this movie is !! Does anyone know the director's address so I can get my five dollars back ???? Eventually someone hit "Stop-loss" from the movie "The worst movie in the Iraq war". To be honest, I don't think there are any good films about the Iraq war, but that's REALLY bad. <br /> <br /> I will not enter into any technical inaccuracies, there are a hundred or so reviews of other GWOT vets who detail them all. If the director had taken the trouble to consult even the lowest E-nothing of technical accuracy, he could have made the film quite realistic ... maybe. I imagine that the writer should be given "credit" for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot of this film from a vivid imagination not afflicted by the restrictions of reality. Someone but me wondering what was the point of this movie? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm quite surprised by all the positive reviews. This film is difficult to control as a veterinarian because of all the obvious inaccuracies, but even if you could overlook this, the plot sucks, the characters are superficial (to say the least) and the acting is at most poor. It is ironic, I suppose, that this film should relate to the Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it is the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
