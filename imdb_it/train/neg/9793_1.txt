Mighty Morphin Power Rangers must be the worst TV show ever made. There is no plot, just a group of stupid costumed children who use martial arts wearing second-class spandex clothes. <br /> <br /> The special effects seem from the 70s, the costumes look like something out of a bad comedy, and the show is simply horrible. <br /> <br /> The only thing worse than the television series are the toys, only second-rate plastic waste fed with our children. <br /> <br /> There are much better shows for your kids to watch! <br /> <br /> Try giving your kids something like Nickelodean, these shows actually have a little intelligence behind them, unlike the power rangers.
