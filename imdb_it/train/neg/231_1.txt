This starts badly, what with the three women who act like high school slaves struggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate delight for those who tell the best 'man' story, and then get worse - = - spoiler alert = - = with the character of Andie who falls in love with the young organist who was his student when he was 14 (he is the director of an English school, believe it or not), just to have destroyed it thanks to his bitch - from-hell "girlfriend". ..and then from there, it's basically unwatchable clapper: she forgives her 'friend' and has the love son of the organ player and the 3 women end up when they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes blah blah blah . The character of Andie launches caramelized chocolates on the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
