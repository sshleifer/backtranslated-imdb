Incredibly unlikely and silly potter who at least has some snappy snap shots, but it's too incredible to generate a lot in terms of tension. I was hoping that Stanwyck wouldn't come back in time because, in reality, she was fond of the wet, more than one way, husband, and she also had an idiot son ... why didn't she run away with Meeker? But the annoying question remains ... what kind of wood was the pier support if a rotten piece hadn't been floated? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does his best with the material but is worn out.
