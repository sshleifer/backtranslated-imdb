I think I've seen all of Grisham's movies now and in general they are all very poor, except for The Rainmaker, but this is so bad that it's unbelievable <br /> <br /> BEWARE SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies where the character does stupid and irrational things that no one would ever do. He's a lawyer for God's sake. Because when his children disappear he doesn't call the police. Oh yes, it's because all the police officers hate lawyers, so they ignore him and let him attack. <br /> <br /> When arrested for murder, they let him go free, he is locked up in a cell waiting for the bail hearing. <br /> <br /> Because you should drag your children halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> The police don't bother to look for an escaped mental patient, they don't bother to interview his daughter. <br /> <br /> Regarding the ridiculous ending ??. <br /> <br /> In summary, silly, very unrealistic and a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
