So there's an old security guard and a guy who dies and then there's KEVIN, the biggest wuss in the world. Kevin wants to impress his incredibly callous, lively and virginal girlfriend AMY. While returning from work to ... a random house ... find his "friends", the KYLE to short red sexually confused and the DAPHNE really disgusting. They are soon joined by Daphne's boyfriend, the cute macho in love with the unnatural sex NICK. And there are the creatures of the title, horrible puppets puppies that kill people by giving them the desire of their heart. Kyle's heart's desire is to mate with a creepy and crappy spandex woman. Nick's desire is to throw grenades at an elementary school cafeteria, I mean the disco. Kevin's heart's desire is to beat a thin hooligan with the nunchaku. Amy's heart's desire is to be a disgusting slut. Daphne is already a lousy crap, so she doesn't have the desire of the heart. Along the way a really horrible band sings a really weird song. The hobgoblins come back randomly from where they came and then explode. "Citizen Kane" cannot compare with this true masterpiece of American cinema.
