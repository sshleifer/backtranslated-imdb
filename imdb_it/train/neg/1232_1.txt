He says a girl named Susan Montford wrote and directed this "film". No wonder he has no other credits in his name for writing or directing. He made a serious professional mistake by choosing this as his career. This is one of the worst human creations of this millennium. <br /> <br /> The fundamental thing that is wrong with this film, apart from its ridiculous story of a woman fleeing four weak thugs, is the obvious and complete lack of LOGIC. <br /> <br /> ** After leaving the mall, she is approached by four thugs as they surround her. Tell me, which woman would stubbornly push a potential aggressor while verbally surrounded and insulted? I don't mean after an attack has already started, because obviously it's completely normal for someone to fight back. But she pushed that boy and practically took her to the next level. No woman would do it unless 1) she had a weapon, 2) she has the security of knowing that the backup is very close, and therefore she is relatively safe from harm, or 3) the attackers are so young, and from the look weak that it's pretty safe she can take them. None of this applied in this situation, so he simply acted like someone asking to be raped or assaulted. And by the way, when the security guard approached, as soon as he came within sight of Kim Basinger, why wouldn't he immediately run towards him for help, or scream? <br /> <br /> ** When he leaves after the security guard is hit in the head, he drives into a deserted area of ​​the city and crashes. He had a three-minute lead over the pursuers, instead of running diagonally behind the houses and climbing the fences and, continuing, he pulled out his red toolbox and started fiddling under his hood. I understand that he was trying to fix his car, but he should have run away. <br /> <br /> (I didn't even mean it was a chronological summary of the film, because I hate the people who do their reviews, but it so happens that every main sequence in this film has something so blatantly stupid from having to comment). <br /> <br /> ** Why should you bring a red toolbox, like yourself? trying to sneak away in the dark? When captured, one of the jokers asks her to open the toolbox. First it resists, then finally opens it. And take out a wrench. This scene here is so rich in subtle nuances of the complete failure of the dramatic effect that I have to break down, it's one of the most stupid scenes in the whole film. When asked to open the box, at first he resists, as if it were his plan to somehow get one of the thugs to open it out of anger after he hasn't opened it, in the same way as someone in some movie d action may have a device that an enemy requires that person to touch / push / open / manipulate, and once the hero refuses to open it, the enemy grabs that device, just to make sure that the device automatically delivers a chemical / shoot him to the face / make him unconscious, which was the hero's plan forever. It seems that what they tried to do with Kim Basinger here, while opening the instruments dramatically and quickly pulls out a KEY and sends one of the thugs, and somehow gets away from him and the other three thugs. <br /> <br /> ** For the rest of the film, in practice what you see is the wife of a suburban house, which wanders in the woods while carrying its red toolbox, extracting various tools used as weapons to kill his attackers. <br /> <br /> ** When she was running away, how did she move BACK where the thugs were? I think it was the scene where they made that radio play aloud as a tribute to the dead. Somehow it crept on them when I thought it was moving away from them. <br /> <br /> ** Finally, all this premise is so weak because the whole reason why it was pursued in the first place is because of the hooligans. "In perspective, she witnessed a murder committed against the "Security officer earlier, and so they thought they had to kill her. How ridiculous it is. As one of the thugs said, they would have just left the city and would have returned from whichever city they came from, no one but her had seen them anyway, and she probably didn't have any got the license plate, even if these possibilities would not work in their favor, how are they doing hell and chasing someone to kill them improving your chances to get away with the original murder?
