Here is another umpteenth blasphemous European story in which they explode the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal firing of Catholics and / or Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic). <br /> <br /> This actually won an Oscar for the foreign film bes. This is probably because history has made Catholics and religious beliefs in general extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He is portrayed as nothing but an idiot. No wonder the academy dominated by secularism has loved this film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, there is an exaggerated madman who plays a boy who renounces his religion, so he can marry one of the four daughters in the story. The daughters in turn seduce the "seminary" student (who claims to have studied for six years but says he is an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous is this movie? !!! <br /> <br /> This is a shame and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film world, all over the world (not just Hollywood).
