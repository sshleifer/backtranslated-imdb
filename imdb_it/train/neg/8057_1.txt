What's wrong with this movie? Many, many things. Editing is too difficult to look beautiful, and it does nothing but confuse the viewer and at the same time provide a powerful headache. The plot is confusing and obviously prolonged by what started as a short (story or film). The plot only lasts less than ten minutes of good history, and this has only painfully lengthened to reach the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we reach them, right? Exactly. They become leaner. In the end, the plot is as thin as paper that you might even lose if you're not paying attention, which is hard to do when you watch this movie. The acting is not even slightly impressive. The characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things that don't go in this film is that, apparently, whoever was responsible for the soundtrack / soundtrack had no idea what the film was, or what it should have been (not that I blame it, not I could understand both). As a result, half of the music in the film does not fit the scenes at all. Also, what was it with all the sexual nuances between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, this was to attract young males, but it was done at such a low price. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? At any level imaginable? Not at all? The two gruesome types seemed to have nothing to do with the film, they were there just to have hunting scenes. I doubt anyone really would like a film so miserably put together and such a shameless and terrible Hollywood attempt at a rather interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend it to teenagers with little attention, who doesn't care about a bad horror thriller, as long as there is sex and blood (although this could only be true for the Killer Cut, which I saw). 1/10
