OK when I saw the previews of this movie I thought it was really scary and I was really excited to see it as the group I was with. Now, living in America, especially during these elections, I see very deceptive things, but I must say that these previews were at the top of the list. I don't see how many people could be scared by this movie. I only noticed two real jumping scenes and just missed one. The whole movie was extremely predictable and maybe that messed up some of the jumping scenes for me. As for the sound effects that many are so scared of, I thought they were comic at best. Oh and the kitten uhh where did it come from and why? The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the strange moan. How can you scare someone? I can easily make that noise. Now don't get me wrong I've always loved all those really bad movies that make you laugh all the time, but I didn't even think that was why it was all right.
