hg is normally exploitative, and it never bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but in reality I don't like pseudo-sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I'm not against witches, and I liked "carrie" (the novel and the film), but this annoyed me. I think it's because of the main character that develops esp from an electric line. even the university professor wastes his time studying cases of esp. I wasn't alive in the 1960s to know first hand if it was true that esp was a common mistake, but I suppose any theory of this nature would simply be discredited. what bothered me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless and unpredictable villains that can look like ordinary people 99% of the time and then just simply shoot. Nothing could be further from the truth. I hate these concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. those who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> there were some decent concepts for the film. I liked the way the witch used men; It was a nice change. I liked how he could make himself attractive, but not when he was near his forced lovers. I found it interesting that even his second lover burned his face. if the script had been retouched for a few weeks before production and was not focused solely on making its audience more stupid, this could have been a decent movie.
