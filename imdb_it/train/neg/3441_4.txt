What the hell was this. Someone obviously read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential anxiety mixed with economic horror. There were moments that disturbed, but each was canceled by horrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem with strange narratives like this is that it feels lazy. Even the work of David Lynch sometimes seems like this, and just like his interesting shows and films, it lasts too long. And unfortunately this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The cast was attractive, and that's the limit of this. I suppose it touches the feelings of teenagers and the fear of loneliness that we all have, but it doesn't make the characters nice enough to make us worry about their fate ... whatever they were. The final scene leaves the whole thing ambiguous.
