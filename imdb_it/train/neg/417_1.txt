I go to the movies every week or so, and I check this site regularly, but never before have I felt compelled to comment on a movie. <br /> <br /> To my list of all the incredibly bad movies - Last Man Standing, Spawn, The Bone Collector - Now I can add the drivel that was 'Hollow Man'. <br /> <br /> From the terrible opening titles - a ridiculous run for the cast and crew put together with spaghetti alphabetti - up to the offensive end - a world record number of clichés and some of the most absurd dialogues and recitations that they've never made it to the cinema - this film is sad, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking long before the end. <br /> <br /> This is not just my opinion, it was that of my friends and all those around us. When large sections of an audience laugh and groan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the film is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, he was also sick. The director brought the action beyond the limits of the realistic price for a violent film, and in the realms of a blood-soaked B-movie. It is difficult not to imagine the director as a kind of old filth, because the extent of the incursions of the invisible man outside the laboratory and into the outside world extended only to two attempts to prove the sensation of some breasts. Maybe sex could be the first thing on a dude's mind if made invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the women involved, it hardly makes cinema fun. <br /> <br /> [spoilers follow] <br /> <br /> Overcoming the sick external movies, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a good job of acting more and more twisted as an "empty man", the rest of them - perhaps distressed by a terrible script - does an even better job of being an empty casket. A long-time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, "He finally tripped" shrugs his colleague without a hint of emotion. This is the point of the course, and the lab team swings between pure terror and complete indifference to such speed that you wonder how they started acting. They cross the terrified lab corridors, their guns poised, but a few seconds later one of the crew members happily jumps down the hall to look for the blood of a wounded colleague. The female protagonist treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humor even after he has insulted her and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to her adventures, even after she drowns the head of the Pentagon, "He drowned in his pool last night" relates same female, so spectacularly fail to put together two and two. <br /> <br /> The script is littered with this kind of misinterpreted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of cinematic clichés, which are laid on more often and faster as the film progresses to complete disbelief and fun in the end. <br /> <br /> The "eureka" moment on the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list is truly endless - the predictable contempt for the strength of the numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but simply put them in a place of probable imminent death and leave them to themselves, the good guy almost dead who appears out of nowhere to save the woman, the bomb and the omnipresent coun tdown timer, the explosion of the fireball that it burns just before it reaches the heroes, the elevator that falls just before hitting them and, more than anything else, the immortality of the villain. <br /> <br /> The invisible man was burned to shreds with a makeshift flamethrower, hit the head with a bar he had just cut straight through one of the minor actors, and after apparently survived the explosion, ball of fire and total destruction of laboratories, it has more than enough life to climb through the fiery sphere for a last pop to the heroes of the film - from which stage the disbelieving public rages and watches their watches. <br /> <br /> That this exceptionally bad film has reached the cinema is staggering. Even the name of the film is as hopeless as the film itself, and even the most impressive special effects are nowhere near saving this, which should be avoided at all costs.
