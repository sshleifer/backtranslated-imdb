Probably the writers had no experience in the army and probably never looked at a history book, but I continue to give credit to this low-cost war movie to have a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second war world. br /> <br /> The action is confusing and unbelievable - any episode of Combat! it has better production values, but the cast is interesting. Seeing the New York giant Rosie Greer was worth paying for it. The art direction is of fifth speed: the men wear the Korean War uniforms, and it was a rather poor time when the United States Army reached Germany in 1944, not sunny as they show here, and I don't think the terrain resembled to Northern California. The script never makes it clear why black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is a nice touch that shows some of the men who carry Springfield rifles instead of the M-1s, which probably would have been released by second-level troops. <br /> <br /> This basic idea (southern racist officer who commands black troops)) should have been expanded into a large budget production, and it is not too late to prove it now. You have to take it for what it is, and I admire the creators of this film for making the effort. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it some time ago and I thought it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because in 1944 there were black combat troops operating there.
