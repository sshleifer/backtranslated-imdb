It's just the Robert De Niro movie that I really hate. It's a stupid movie with horrible acting (obviously not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma has to make his mafia films as always as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved Mission: Impossible by De Palma (1996). De Niro has also worked with Palma twice, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I thought The Wedding Party was OK (I didn't look at Greetings). <br /> <br /> The script is really bad and not very funny. There is no scene where I can smile even once. The film lost the chance to be a fun style even in a "Be Black Baby" movie and I also don't like the scene where a boy's sexual organ appeared. So, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! only worse. I hate that.
