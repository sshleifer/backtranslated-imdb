I'm not sure if I'm referring to those who have labeled this video as ugly or to the director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a bizarre horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a comical goose mixture of superior films like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run". Chick is kidnapped in the "jungle" by a "tribe" of "savages". The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies walking in a Party City style Halloween costume with tribal clothes. And the savages vary in race, from white to Asian, from black to Hispanic. I guess Franco just grabbed someone who seemed even a bit ethnic for this romp. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this film has an ultra minimal gage, no real fear and a lot of unnecessary pain. It's not funny. I can find something I like in almost all the squalid Italian or Euro-trash movies; this has just fallen little VIA. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10, children.
