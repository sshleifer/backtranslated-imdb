This film has several key flaws. The first and most significant of which is the clear lack of a good plot! This sadly makes the film not only difficult to watch, but also sends the observer certain feelings of despair, as if he were wasting precious time on their short lives. This means that the film cannot fascinate the public, instead it encourages the public of visitors to despise the film and all that is associated with it! In short, it's really, really, really, really, really, really bad! Do yourself a favor and chew up a big rubber shoe, you will find it much more interesting and fun than looking at Terminator Woman.
