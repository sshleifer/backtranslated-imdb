When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant insect chasing some nurses) and the name "Blue Monkey", I knew I wasn't in any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese ball movie, which always does a good job in whatever role he faces ... The special effects are pretty mundane, there's not too much plot, and I'm still not I'm sure the reason this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with the monkey. But come on people, what did you expect ?? It's not as bad as it sounds ... If you like old black and white movies of 50s style insect attacks, this is basically an updated version, without special FX updates
