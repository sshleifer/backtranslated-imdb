My roommate got the soundtrack of No, No, Nanette as dubbing on a tape and she continued to listen to it without interruption. After he completely washed my brain to submit, I found the songs irresistible, especially the famous ones, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy ... But from the soundtrack I didn't know what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy in the video store and rented what was supposed to be a lost version of the movie. I was thinking it would be great, because the soundtrack is so pretty. Unfortunately most of the songs I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I've never seen the 1930s version of the musical, but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little to sing and practically without dancing and, apart from that, the sound was really bad and you couldn't really understand that that people were saying a lot of time. In fact, the only highlights of this film were the extravagant 40s fashion. Nanette is wearing this crazy hat with two feathers that stand out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather peg on her arm and then wrapped herself in this network scarf. The only dance sequence is a bit strange even with Nanette doing this strange dance material with images of pin-ups superimposed over her. In fact, another bright spot in the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a good artist, but who is currently condemned to draw money for pin-up girls. I like how Guillespe keeps the old school, and quenches Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that was to make his career, is sold by Nanette for a paltry $ 5250. Don't you realize that that piece was his immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with your rabbit feather ears on the hat. When will you learn? Why not just smoke a cigarette before the advertising men take the Opera away?
