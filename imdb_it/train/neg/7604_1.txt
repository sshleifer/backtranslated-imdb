Of course, it takes place in the West, but the title makes it look like it's a conventional western. Instead, it's a film by a sheriff woman. Make no mistake even if this is a bad movie about a sheriff woman. Become a sheriff when her husband is killed; she's just a little upset by this. His main goal is to chase the bad guy who is also a woman, but the bad guy hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the murderer and vice versa. Absolutely stupid, as anyone who has killed in this film has the new sheriff to thank. He had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I guess he liked it, he wouldn't. The killer is also after the mayor of the city for personal reasons who are also rather stupid. This film is very boring and not worth looking at ... it's not one of the best episodes of MST3000 made. I can't imagine anyone seeing this without them, because that would make it much more painful. Corman is a low-budget director, but he should know better than having people go to one place and leave another.
