"Arahan" does not add anything positive to the genus Kung Fu. Comparing this film confused with the inspired madness and quality of Stephen Chow's films is a mistake. <br /> <br /> First of all the fighting scenes are nothing new. Everything presented here was done first and best by the likes of Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fights in smart Motion Pictures need logic. It seems useless to serve shots that do not have harmful effects as in the sequels of "Matrix". <br /> <br /> The attractive female protagonist So-Yi Yoon has fascinated the screen but has never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in "House Of Flying Daggers" . Having a martial arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies. Casting actors with no experience in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Ueto in "Asumi") unless you are a very talented director who like "Arahan" proves that Seung-wan Ryoo is not.
