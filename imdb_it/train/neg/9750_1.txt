The film, a Universal version of a Protelco-MLC production, is a tedious tale of the theory of breaking down the molecular structure of an object, capturing it in a cell as "pure energy", and then sending it back to "target area." There is no explanation WHY it is necessary, but Professor Paul Steiner (played by Brockant Haliday, "Devil Doll"), thinks it is something to devote to his assistants, Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell (Ronald Allen) , lives in. <br /> <br /> During an experiment in front of the famous Dutch scientist "Lembach" (Gordon Heinz), his machine fails due to sabotage, so he "projected" himself by his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp) to take revenge . Sure, she gets ruined and he comes out like a "roast pork" with the power to electrocute people. <br /> <br /> With this new power, he manages to tear some Cockney idiots, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and his lab chief, dr. Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He is also able to enter a pharmacy and also steal a pair of rubber gloves and a black coat. <br /> <br /> In the end, despite Hill's and Mitchell's attempt to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. Overall, a completely useless movie with no message. <br /> <br /> Even one of the most depressing color movies you've ever seen.
