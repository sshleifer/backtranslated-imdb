I was interviewed to watch this movie from a friend who complained about how cute this story was. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back, how could I have done so many more productive things with my time ... like, for example, fiddling with my thumbs. I don't see anything redeeming this film, except for the sweet aspect of it ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and it's generous)
