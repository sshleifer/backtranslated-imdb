What a boring movie! To sum up, it was basically just Nana Patekar who beat her sister-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to escape from the village with her son. Can anyone say BORING ??? The concept was not bad, but it was badly executed. Canadian locals and some scenes from the village have been well filmed. However, overall the cinematography has come closer. The story could have been great, but the film seemed to drag it. There is only so much stupidity that a person can bear, not to mention three damn hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole film was the song "Ishq Kamina", which lasted only five minutes. Apart from that, this film was a piece of shit.
