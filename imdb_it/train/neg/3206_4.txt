I was excited about the idea that Cesar Montano had decided to shoot a film in the Cebuano language. (Not "dialect" as most Filipinos incorrectly refer to it. Like Cebuano and Tagalog they are mutually unintelligible as French and Spanish are among them.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this film. Being a Canadian, of Cebuano's parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this film. I was even more excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or a melodrama like Filipinos love these types of movies. But alas, I was little changed. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy is an ego journey for Cesar Montano. Montano obviously plays the hero of the film. And when I say "hero" I mean in the most stereotyped way; its function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the Bol-anon to victory over the Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. It only fits the hero's mold. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; they are all suited to their cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> They're all for slow-moving / meditative movies, but this movie was just slow. He didn't really meditate on anything. Just because a film has a historical theme, a dramatic and slow movie doesn't make it a well-made film. <br /> <br /> The American actor Philip Anthony is particularly annoying. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan film industry, he really should have thought of it. He said he wanted to make Visayan films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc. But in reality this film would have been booed and hissed at these festivals. In order for the Visayan films to become mainstream they should at least have made a film that would have attracted the public, even if it meant sacrificing quality. Obviously he didn't think or get information on what kind of films were awarded at Cannes, so a film that attracts the public would have been at least a foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid now that Visayan movies won't be made for a long time because of this movie. If I had ever told a Filipino I wanted to see more Visayan movies, I would have had an answer like, "The Visayans don't make good movies. Didn't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Obviously this is ridiculous as it is an example of a Visayan film and probably the only example anyone could see today. <br /> <br /> An example of meditative films, not just slow ones, are the Tagalog film Blackout or The Straight Story by David Lynch. I hate promoting the Tagalog language as it is continually and unfairly promoted and pushed into the throats of non-Tagalog Filipinos, but for the sake of calling things by their name I say that Blackout is a VERY good movie. These films rely heavily on what Hitchcock called "pure cinema". Wordless images are used to convey the story. But I fold the definition a little for the sake of these two films as these films use wordless images to convey the atmosphere of the film. and they do it very well. Panaghoy thinks that if they simply limited themselves to taking pictures of the landscape, then they established the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And what is it about so many Filipino films with a dying mother or grandmother ???
