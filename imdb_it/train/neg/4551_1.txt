I have to admit I don't care much about the New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy" I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it can help solve the problem of global warming. When energy is "applied" I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and are still without Nobel prizes. When people feel how instinct enables them to navigate flawlessly through the complexities of life, I wonder how they can not do something as simple as finding the train station. <br /> <br /> But then again, this is not the first movie with plot holes and most I find them perfectly acceptable and fun. If this were the case with "The Celestine Prophecy", I would not want to burn this film, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems bored by his head and unable to understand what he should do on the spot. This translates into many "Ah-s" and "Oh-s", as I tend to do when it comes to quantum physics with someone who really knows what he's talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> the management is not inspired. You could expect something more from the guy who did "What dreams can come", but hey, I assumed he was well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a New York taxi driver: "It's your money, man. .. ". only one who seems to be having fun is the all-time villain JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this film who could have some wise rift in this eternal and terribly boring New Age chat. <br /> <br /> This movie is very similar to one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore that seems unable to shut up. In a moment, it seems that the words turn into small ping pong balls that are constantly thrown on the head until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to have fun and you have to choose between this movie and attach safety pins on the eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
