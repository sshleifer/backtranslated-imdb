Put aside a repetition of Dr. House that I missed and a Desperate Housewives (new) to see this. I don't know exactly what has affected this movie. I never thought I'd say it, but I want to get my 15 minutes of fame back. <br /> <br /> Script, Direction, I can't say. I recognized the actors' stable (the usual suspects), but I thought that Herbert Marshall was a class addition and I sat down for a good cheese film. Boy, I was wrong. Dullsville. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: where the "office girl" does with the keypunch 029 and puts the cards in a sorter 087. LOL @ "the computer". I'd like someone to identify the next device: a 477? It is even before this dinosaur's time. <br /> <br /> And we dinosaurs don't have much time to waste.
