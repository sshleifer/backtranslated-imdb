I understand that I want to make a film that is edgy and different. I understand the previous comment of the reviewer that this is a poorly understood film. My point is that as soon as this movie finished my first comment was: "this is what happens when a rich princess wants to be a movie star and has no talent" ... she uses dad's money to make a movie that wrote, directs and pays for ..... obviously to close the film to realize that there was no character development and no direction as a beginning, a medium and an ending ..... the voyeur part was good and angular, but what was the point? I saw a woman go to a house, find photos, fuck the caretaker, go out on a very cold night (not credible) to check the noise and run over her guardian lover .... the film ends ... ... Does anyone educate my ignorant arss ?? I really want to know what the point is ... what was the vision of the directors ... why no development of the dead lover? Why no background on the keeper? What is the point of night vision? What is the point of the lipstick on the machine? Why a dead keeper? Why talk to us about an escaped mental patient / a peeping cat? What is the urn? Oh and the lamp is that we suppose we mean who this house is? Territorial? Why? Why should the caretaker feel like his own home? that aspect has never been pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I rented this film because it was in there and known for sharp-edged characters ..... rewrite and tell me what I need to learn ... .I'm just a mom in Central America who loves movies .... Chris ....
