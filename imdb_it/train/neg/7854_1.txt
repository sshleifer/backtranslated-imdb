wow, this is the worst movie ever. the only reason I joined IMDb was that I could complain about this movie. I never came out of a theater or stopped a DVD, but I almost stopped doing it (and I should do it). but I looked at it until the end only to be disappointed again with an absolutely terrible ending. wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time has long been. I've never seen the first one and never seen it. his terrible acting with a terrible plot. hey look at someone who is polishing a mirror and we're going to take a look. and the sad part is that when this movie arrived on DVD, it was completely verified forever. so I feel bad for all the people who saw this junk.
