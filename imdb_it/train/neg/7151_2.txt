I am proud to say that I saw all three Fast and Furious movies. Of course, the plots are rather silly, and they could be a bit rough, but I love their car chases, and all the beautiful cars and clandestine night runs. And I will gladly see a fourth one. <br /> <br /> Do you want to know what the difference is between these three and Redline? A decent acting, a rather thoughtful plot, even if they are repented, and, last but not least, the directors that All three were made by very competent directors, all took the film in a different direction, just as exciting. Redline seems that the producer chose a dozen women with whom he slept on the casting couch, and turned them into extras, then picked up his clues from the Hollywood unemployment line. And the script. Yours. The Mystery Science Theater 3000 is bad. This is the 70's made for bad TV movies. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film had some nice cars, but you can't really see many of them in action, and the action is so badly directed that you can't be excited by the chases, if the machines don't excite you , why go to a movie like this? <br /> <br /> I'm in the audience with a group of teenagers, and I can't stop laughing out loud. Im getting dirty looks, but this was just a debacle. <br /> <br /> Rent the F & F films. Go to the Nascar Race. Go on a go-kart track and compete. Whatever you do, avoid Redline as a cheap cheese.
