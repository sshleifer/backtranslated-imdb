"Back of Beyond" takes place in a dive diner / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in an uncomfortable situation when some visitors arrive unexpectedly. We get what, at first, seems confusingly a flashback in which he and his sister (even though their mutual relationship is better understood later in the film) are crossing the desert on his motorcycle. Later, he appears as a terribly silent, sometimes moody character in the presence of arrivals. <br /> <br /> We know that one thing is certain and that it is the sort of spiritual sense of McGregor, his prediction of danger and such - his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, most of which concern three diamond thieves that the car breaks down and that they rely on Tom to help them out of place without hindering them. Sure, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, he puts all three allies already wary of each other. But not in a way that translates into something very mystery or action. In fact, the whole film seems to want to create something meaningful, but in reality it can't do it. Even the ending, which unfolds like a bonfire story (and which really reveals many narrative flaws), is almost as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It is worth trying if you don't do it mind you at the terribly slow pace, but you're in the mood, at least, for something slightly different than usual.
