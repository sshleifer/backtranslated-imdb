Unlike most other commentators, I deeply hate this series. <br /> <br /> It starts to look interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up to the last episode. In the end, I still didn't understand what the alien attacks were (maybe I missed something, who knows?) And I realized that I had gone through 26 episodes composed mainly of hatred of the characters, selfishness and self-pity. It actually reverses between alien / robot fights and these dark and depressing flashing scenes where one or more characters can simply say or shout "I hate" 10-12 times in a row. <Br /> <br /> I can't really see neither Shinji nor Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (I can't even see any of the other characters learning or growing). I wanted to kick them and tell them to have a bloody life during the first few episodes, and the feeling didn't change during the last few. Shinji really does have that kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an irritating person that she wants to destroy the TV screen every time she appears. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and they say it often veeeeeeeery. <br /> <br /> I am otherwise a big fan of anim√© and manga, and never before have I liked it so much. I read that the creator / writer of the series wrote this while suffering from depression, and I can believe it; it made me depressed to watch it. Is this the purpose of this series? I am sincerely asking. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if you suffer from depression, why not write a book or a biography about it instead of mixing it with aliens and mechas? This plot of alien warfare, as far as I could tell, absolutely leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> Finally, since I am really fascinated by how many people claim to love this mosaic of outgoing plots, I can help myself, but ask yourself how many of them actually find it good, and how many say they do it because it is been told that it is.
