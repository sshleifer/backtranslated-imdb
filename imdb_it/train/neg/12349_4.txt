A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G.i. Jane tells the story of a first woman who has ever followed hellish training to Navy SEALs. The training is the most difficult and difficult one in which the instructor says in the film to the protagonist O'Neil played by Demi Moore. There is no message or particular point in this film or I could not reach it correctly. It could be a sort of affirmation of female rights and abilities, but everything sinks beneath the tired scenes and the stupid gunfight at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I can't really understand why Ridley uses so many zooms when I talked about the last gunfight in the desert ?! He looks so stupid, irritating and almost amateur, so I'd really like to know what the director saw in that technique. When I watch his latest film, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the battle scenes (which are many) and are very intense and skillfully directed. The entire final in G.I. Jane looks ugly and is nothing but stupid and brainless to shoot and kill. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst film in my opinion and there are no significant touches that this great director is known for. I'm still happy to have seen it in Widescreen format because there are still a couple of fantastic scenes and samples of Scott's skills, but they are very few in this film. <br /> <br /> A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I am forced to give to G.I. Jane 4/10.
