The subtle story concerns two brothers from small towns and their struggles for the honor of the family. David Morse is the responsible policeman and the "good" brother; Viggo Mortensen, the "bad" boy, is a former soldier and former prisoner. As an actor (especially in his early years), Sean Penn appears to have modulated his performances under the Method. Turning for the first time writer and director to this obtuse artistic drama, he works with the script and the characters through the same methodical process, slowing the pace to a crawl (apparently so as to capture every nuance and inflection). This approach could be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to worry about, but the photogenic Morse and Mortensen are not really convincing as brothers. Worse still, we expect more from prominent veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who are unlikely to have the chance to get something interesting. The image is stuttering with turgid sequences, a shaky narrative and a confused editing (always inclined to indicate artistic excesses). Penn's tricks with the camera show an eye of talent, but they are mostly irritation. * 1/2 from ****
