I don't know ... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much. Too much love for music, too many parties, too much contrast between the good life of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything seems fake to me: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It simply sells a small taste of fake Latin American culture. I have to be honest: he seduced me a little, but who wouldn't be seduced by those fake lives of good music, sex and parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this where people don't suffer from diarrhea, deep sadness and sexually transmitted diseases? I liked the scene with the call from Caridad's mother and the discussion on the contract with all the musicians and Spaniards.
