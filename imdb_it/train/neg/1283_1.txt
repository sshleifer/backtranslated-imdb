I must say that the first time I saw this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it a lot. I bought the DVD recently, and after a second viewing I wondered why I liked it. The acting was horrible, and as usual we have the typical stereo clans in their fake costumes. The acting was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job as Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The plot was good, but the execution was poor. I'm tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like that in the movies. Braveheart was even worse, which is a film that only saves grace. But seriously, people didn't talk like that at the time, why should all the actors have the accents of Glasgow? Just another film to try to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I note that the only people here who say this movie is good are Americans, and to be honest I can see why they would like it, I know they have a crush on men at Kilts. However, if you're thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
