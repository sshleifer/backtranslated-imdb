This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of crazy characters on a stupid mission. His characteristic climax has the entire cast of the film that meets and fights each other in a crazy crowd of hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in the Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Do not get me wrong; As absurd clich√©s and films can be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most of his previous films there has been a certain good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri are noteworthy). Now, the hilarity of his films is fading while he always uses the same formula. <br /> <br /> The tracks are good. Tanushree Datta looks fantastic. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is OK, and Sharman Joshi is the best.
