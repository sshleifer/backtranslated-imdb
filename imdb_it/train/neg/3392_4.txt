What's in Indonesian music movies? I've never seen Indonesian music films like those made in Bollywood. The spirit of history is missing and only a few "poetic" lines that they have called. <br /> <br /> This story about the love of two children who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. It's a simple plot (but it's quite focused though) with "understandings for be "lines of musical stories here and there. <br /> <br /> The confused characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are overlooked. The main actress could try to live the character, but it's the best she could do, trying. As for the casting, I don't feel the need to put a Balinese student in that story and, of course, they are not the only unnecessary characters. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, why should I want to watch this movie? Maybe because of the mangoes ...
