I tried watching this movie twice and both times I still couldn't reach the credits. The first time I managed to sit in the first fight sequence, then I lost interest. The second time I managed to force myself to digest for over an hour of poor acting, lame SFX and extremely poor direction. Pales in comparison to the original. <br /> <br /> Has anyone ever heard of the old ET Atari 2600 fiasco? For those who didn't let me in. It's 1982 ... ET is one of the biggest box-office hits of all time ... Atari decides to release a tie-in video game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially painful story, the game was very successful and brought thousands and thousands of Atari 2600 ETs to be dumped in landfills because they couldn't even give them away, let alone sell them. <br /> <br /> What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Watch the 3.2 grade and find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie ... IMDb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems don't go to 0, let alone the negatives.
