This film is not only bad, not just trivial, it is repulsive. Something about Daphne, the frightening call girl, the whole damn (and I use the word literally) film radiates a grotesque that would offend a lover of the brothel. This film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs and makes me feel unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used a concept that good. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the Worst Nightmare clich√© and the exaggerated Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating cinematic idea. <br /> <br /> Thought: the reason hobgoblin must be killed before the day is that they are attracted to bright lights. During the day, bright lights are not seen well, so they can go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count the Hobgoblin: four hobgoblins drive out of the movie studio, yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed throughout the course of the film. <br /> <br /> Question for discussion: If you had a cold, demanding and little appreciated girl, would you go into garden combat with a military iron head? Explain.
