Despite the impressive cast and pedigree, Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The plot is not realistically complicated, the actors have bad accents and the participation of the director Robert Altman is equivalent to the collection of a check. Once again he has assembled an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) which this time is a mixed bag. But this is only part of the problem. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a senior Georgian lawyer who in the opening scenes of the film manages to get absurdly seduced by a mysterious waitress from the catering company that convinces him he is in grave danger from an ex- husband and a crazy dad. With red flags everywhere, the astute lawyer trudges even if he manages to bring his children in danger. Gun and fist fights follow a car chase and if that wasn't enough there is a hurricane launched for the ultimate ridicule. <br /> <br /> Branagh plays MacGruder with a disappointing and unconvincing southern accent. Running in a trench coat in all types of weather is blind to the obvious to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as a P.I. but with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as the old man is Boo Radely, everything has grown more insane than an insect serving thick slices of ham, but at least his twang is plausible. The female protagonists (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) are thin and light. Even celebrity lawyers who come in cameos (Vernon Jordan) are wooden with the few launch lines they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying little attention to his actors, the mose en scene of Altman dripping with Spanish moss is murky and shapeless, his comic strip of action scenes. He lacks his touches and his unusual observations (informs the viewer that the stars and bars still sway in Georgia) that make Altman so well done. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man is Altman at his worst, even if the pay is the same.
