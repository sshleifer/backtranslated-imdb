I'm a big fan of 50s science fiction, but this isn't one of my favorites. While the concept behind the film was a natural vehicle for a classic science fiction film for teenagers, the director relied too much on it to carry the film forward. It is clear that he was working without money, because the whole film is full of inflated dialogues that go on forever. I've * never * seen so much time to kill in a movie. <br /> <br /> There are probably less than 60 seconds of "blob footage" in the entire movie, and most of the rest is addictive. in a poorly written dialogue. It was fun to see Steve M. and Anita C. together, but my goodness ... why did the casting think that someone in their right mind would have thought them teenagers?
