A scene shows the mentality of "Terminator Woman" quite well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's field. Karen crosses an armed guard, who points the gun at her, but flings after a few seconds and challenges her to fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, takes the gun and runs away! Then again, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you shouldn't expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble have a great time soon and the film could be improved if it focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they separate, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fighting scene to rekindle things, there's no excitement. The final has Trimble fighting Qissi in a cave and Sheperd going womano-a-womano against beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are interspersed in a way that interrupts their flow and decreases their value. On the positive side, congratulations to the costume department for giving Karen the chance to show spectacular necklines throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
