OK, first of all the video seems to have been shot in the 80s. I was shocked to discover that it was published in 2001. Secondly, the plot was everywhere, the story is confusing. If there had been any brief prologue or introduction, the story would have been better. I also appreciate the fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly turned. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were strange. It was difficult to follow and perhaps it was the translation, but it was also difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie I suggest the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and a good character development) not this movie. Attention, you will be disappointed.
