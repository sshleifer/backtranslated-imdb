I rented this movie because it seemed pretty interesting, but for my Horror this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen! I read Gumby-8's comment and he must be part of the cast or crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4-year-old child or a member of a demented cult, no one would think this film had potential. <br /> <br /> I could not believe the comments of Gumby-8. <br /> <br /> Citing: "From the opening animation inspired by" Dune "to the fast pace ... this film keeps the eye in motion and works so well that repeating the display is not unexpected." <br /> <br /> Animation is the only aspect of the film that was interesting and the fact that the film keeps the eye in motion, that's why you keep looking for any kind of suspense. I mean, give me a break. Halloween was shot with a budget of $ 100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way it became a cult classic. As for "the repetition of the vision is not unexpected" I think he made a typo. <br /> <br /> Another quote from Gumby-8, the only Fan: "Acting is also a strong aspect of the film." <Br /> <br /> With due respect for the actors, their performance is none other than the respective talent of Robert Napton. <br /> <br /> The eye-catching Tagline: "Watch out for the hour between sunset and darkness" <br /> <br /> This is because there is no darkness or darkness in this film. <br /> <br /> MPAA rating "R nominal for some violence / blood" <br /> <br /> The only blood you see is a red paint on a sheet over a corpse you never see. As far as I know it could be a tuft of grass. <br /> <br /> In summary, I saw the horror films of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I saw what I thought was the worst and some that were very good. The director of this film made no attempt, was asleep, or took an acid blow. In any case, I think the actors deserve applause for trying to recover a bad job of directing. I would give this film a .5 rating for a "B" movie.
