Timberlake's performance almost made the screen stick. It wasn't bad at all, I just think that the role of journalists was wrong for him. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J played the typical role of the rapper, the toughest and meanest guy around. I don't think the smile crackled in the whole film, not even when it was proposed to his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman practically played the entire movie. He had some funny scenes that are the high point of the movie. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey was not good or bad, he was just "there". <br /> <br /> Overall it's a boring movie. negative plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors.
