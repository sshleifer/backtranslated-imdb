I don't know about you, but I always felt attracted to the "ART" cinema. The first "art" film I could get was Peter Greenaway's "The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover", which blew my mind and my creative spirit. The film was the definitive paradox, both beautiful and grotesque ... this was the "art cinema", exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral screen to the goal. Life, real life, can be like living in an asylum, and express art shows it for what it is. I love movies of all kinds, but especially those that entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with his position or not ... <br /> <br /> "8 1/2 WOMEN", it is a dry, clinical "comedy" where father and son gather a harem to fill their numerous sexual fantasies. In the film there is only a very brief allusion to Fellini, unlike what was suggested by the previews. The film's main focus is on the "close" relationship between father and son, reunited after their mothers died. In the first scenes of the film the sadness of the fathers is credible, you can feel his pain. What happens next is clear from the standards of Greenaway, the collection of the harem, the observations on love and death and the flesh exposed for the sake of meat ... It could be objected, but I think the film is superficial and meaningless . And the idea that this could be a comedy perplexes me. Acting for the most part if all goes well, ... particularly good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (although poor Mandy should get her clothes back) What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touch of excess which made her other films so wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> While filled with moments of intuition and the occasional taboo, "8 1/2 women" is too cut and pasted to be considered art, too insipid to consider "funny", and simply too boring to be considered useful. <br /> <br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this movie as a sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
