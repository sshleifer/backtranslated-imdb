When I saw this movie being shown on TV, I couldn't wait to do it. I grew up in the 80s and like all the others who grew up at that time, I saw the movie for teens and summer camps of the 80s. So I couldn't wait to see this movie that totally parodies that kind of movie. What a disappointment!! The film was nothing but a bunch of bad jokes and gags, again and again, with very little plot and no substance. And the attempts of filmmakers for dark humor have totally failed - some of these so-called jokes have not been seen as something absolutely cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were wardrobe, music and acting. It was nice to take a nostalgic trip and see all the summer clothing styles from the 80s, and the same goes for the music. And the acting was top notch: almost all the best Hollywood comedians were present. Too bad they didn't have better material to work with.
