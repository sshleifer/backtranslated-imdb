Antonioni's films have not aged well. What has always surprised me about them is that, in addition to an indisputable plastic beauty, there is a boring and didactic "psychology" of characters and situations. Remember, for example, the conversations between Mastroianni and the "evil capitalist" who wants to sing it in "La notte", or Monica Vitti who laughs at the peasants who flirt in the train in "La aventura", or Ferzetti who drops the chalice of ink at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> I reviewed "Zabriskie Point" yesterday. In this film there are many beautiful and elaborate shots of Rod Taylor's office, the streets and highways of Los Angeles, advertising advertisements, deserts, etc., which show the author's fascination with his American journey, in the same much more than Wim Wenders years later. Unfortunately, there are also many hippie-left cliches that ruin the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, steals an airplane and flies over the desert to free himself and find "something different". - The managers of the gray suites always talk about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object women" in the pool and leaves because she doesn't want to be like them. - The fat bourgeois couple of the caravan speaks, faced with the beauty of nature, of building a hotel and earning a lot of money. - Last but not least, lots of couples making love in the desert. What a hippie banality! <br /> <br /> Sorry, today, half a century after the "revolution" of "La Aventura", we can see that the king is naked and his films (except "The friends" and perhaps "The scream") are alone a handful of aestheticism and clich√©s.
