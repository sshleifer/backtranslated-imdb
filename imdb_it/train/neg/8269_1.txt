This esteemed production has its fans. But to paraphrase the classic bad review of "Mary Reilly", Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower. <br /> <br /> This is because the philosophical reasons for a cinematographic "production" are never to make a great film rather than to replace the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a transfer of books to the cinema) with a list of unresolved vanities, not dynamic but dazzling, in an attempt to persuade spectators to think they saw greatness. As viewers and critics are prone to this, the Oscars follow, fueling the entire mute equation. <br /> <br /> I do not share the pleasure of all these reviewers. Moby Dick is incredibly unattractive. Actors diligently recite essays on Jonah, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all things that can't be answered, and none of which are absorbent in the slightest. It is dramatically inert. Does not build. In narrative terms, Moby Dick (like a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion looking for a true story. After half an hour I was mumbling "Oh terrifying ... another oath ... another 4 minute soliloquy!" <br /> <br /> In the failed attempt to get involved, it's a pretty exaggerated showcase. Lots of gray hair here. Starbuck should be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> We know that you are looking at a great director when he plays his medium rather than trying to replicate the feeling of someone else's paintings and palette, or reverently embalm a classic like Huston does here. Paintings and books are beautiful but they are different media. A film like this can't understand that an honestly enjoyable piece of shit (Village of the Damned) is better in many respects than an unbearable piece of culture. This is the Eat Your Vegetables production school. <br /> <br /> We appreciate the work that must have been done to make the film, but not the narrative. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; the registration of barracks as a means of structuring work and various efforts at sea; and whaling technology. And this doesn't require a two-hour movie.
