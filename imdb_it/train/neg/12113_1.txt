Townies is the laziest movie I've ever seen and I've seen Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). He looks confused in what he wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to watch. He has scenes of a man who does "slapstick / bloody" karate so I think, oh this movie will be in the mood for Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then he skips without warning in a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman and a trusted mother. Then he slaps himself in the UNICA a good part of the film that seems to be set up like a sitcom without the traces of laughter. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE that is so lonely that it finds comfort in a decomposing corpse. This was the ONLY part of the film that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a life of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is, there is a sort of DOCUMENTARY at the end of Wayne's (the director) film that mocks Toby (the star) in public. It hurt me. Although Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other Wayne films) are not the best, at least they are thought enough to be entertained up to the end credits. I also like the Killer Nerd, I still have some magnificent lines that I still use today. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like movies out of the ground, and if you like watching your feet, just resting they were, you won't like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br />
