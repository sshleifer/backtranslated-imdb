I had the misfortune of seeing all the 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this incredibly ugly film. It fails on practically all levels; the cast is horrible, acting - at best and the plot lacks depth, leaving me incredibly apathetic about the outcome of any of the twisted lines. <br /> <br /> Plan B does not have the charm this genre is meant to convey and I found myself physically creating myself at various points where the script regularly carries its misinterpreted meanders towards the comedy region. <br /> <br /> A real movie film.
