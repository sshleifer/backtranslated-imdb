Poor acting, no screenplay, no storyline, no convincing killers, no suspense, no original configuration, use the same closet / under the bed / person tactic behind your mirror over and over again making it repetitive and boring, and NOT in a prefiguration , and the fact that NO ONE is ever "really" killed (at least not on screen), which in turn makes you lose all suspense that could invoke it from the outside and makes everyone feel a big scam spending money on their admission ticket .. .. is a horror movie without any horror LMAO. The MOST you see is what looks like someone has taken a bottle of ketchup and sprayed it onto a piece of plastic. <br /> <br /> You have to be a teenager who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring you for enjoying this, or you were tall / drunk at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and I don't care to write reviews that often unless I really hated something, or liked it very much. <br /> <br /> But this film is HEAVY and I feel I have a duty to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of direction ever again! <br /> <br /> It's one thing to rent a "bad" movie at the Weinstein blockbuster, the other when you have to sit in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want a little nostalgia for the remake, forget it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a re-imagination. It's not scary, neither engaging, nor is it satisfying enough to be "funny" as others on IMDb have claimed ... it's just stale and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you will take away from this movie: remembering the scar on Brittany Snow's head that stands out more than the plot, the fact that Jonathan Schaech should have some sexual relationship with JS Cardone of "The Forsaken" has got another killer role (because it's as scary as my poodle, and too cute to kill almost everyone) and that for some reason (duh) everyone who returns to the hotel suite never returns. What kind of person wouldn't worry at the dance when they decide to announce the candidates for the king and queen of the dance and the fiercely competitive girl somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. DO NOT waste money like me. Even "original" sucks, but it's more a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, even if it's not as bad as this piece of shit (I'm sorry I sound vulgar or rude, but once you've seen this you'll understand why I say that what I say).
