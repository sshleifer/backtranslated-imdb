The brides die on the altar and their corpses are disappearing. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to be able to understand why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. Sopportami. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this while he is extracting the spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his old wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities understand that someone has to design the deaths and disappearances, but obviously they can't understand the unlikely motive. We ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and move on ... If you can overcome the first twenty minutes of this disaster, you will be treated with Lugosi who whips his lab assistant out of respect for one of the brides he killed, explaining that he finds himself sleeping a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (such as budget and plot). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and notably the inept police can't be seen anywhere!), And then the fun really begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and acting are OK. There are many well-dressed and good-looking people in this movie. The direction is right and the script is a little better than the material it deserves. However, this film fails to sustain everyone's interest, except the most inveterate b-film fan. The best thing ... It will end, but not soon enough.
