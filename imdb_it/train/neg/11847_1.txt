I'm shocked at how bad this movie is. As a pastiche of 20th century Hollywood artists set a new bass - even past The Moderns or (out of breath) Cradle Will Rock and I never thought I'd see a movie worse than those 2. Granted that they concerned a slightly different environment and period . However, the intent and results were strangely similar. <br /> <br /> First of all there is the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? I'm sorry? Peter, do you have anything to this guy? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons ?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies ??? Good heavens, these people don't even start trying to capture the look or sound of the period they're supposedly describing. <br /> <br /> Well, the Last Picture Show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster and the rest of Bogdonovitch's photos have not been much better. Guessing Rubbing against Welles & Hitch and Ford ran out a long time ago. However good for hosting TCM.
