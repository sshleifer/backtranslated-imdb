In the third episode of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to chase the tall man, assisted by a unleashed nine year old, a G.I. black. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since black and black comedy is much less inspired and exciting than in Phantasm II. I had the feeling that the stress was simply attributed to Reggie's incompetence as a lover and her talent as a stand-up comedian. The humor of the previous film was much drier and more oppressed, which is better suited to a story like this. Also, the settings are not so macabre here, besides the constant presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) is not so obvious ?? There is still a lot of blood but not half is satisfying this time. By the way, watch out for the severely cut version, as it shows the most enjoyable off-screen kills. The entire series of Fantasmi is the result of the life of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes to date, the fifth is in production. The first is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror-party of blood and violence and the rest can easily be skipped. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros played his character much better in Phantasm II.
