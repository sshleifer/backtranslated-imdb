I'm a big fan of old horror movies, and since I'm middle-aged, old to me is a film made before 1970 with most of the 60s and 60s. I'm not a big fan of the most modern horror movies, with an exception in Creepshow 1, which I thought was excellent. I could remember the stories there, but I really liked the monster in the story of the box with Hal Holbrook, and even that of the really clean guy was a fantastic ending. All the stories were great though. So why did I like them so much? The characters had a decent development, the lines were very clear about who was good and who was bad, the horror pieces were intensified with a close-up of a face terrified by fear, and the fun parts were really fun! This sequel either lacks much of these elements or they are totally absent! I'm writing this only after seeing it partially because the film was a complete waste of time and I turned it off to do other things like writing reviews on IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and an old Dorothy Lamoure get good results, they tell you something ..... 4 of 10. Furthermore, Romero's skills are hard to find here, they must have told him to reduce it to a PG standard (I don what was evaluated, but it looks like PG), and it's not a good thing for a movie without anything else. It is shown on the Encore cable channel if you are dying (crap) to see it.
