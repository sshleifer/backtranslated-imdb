I'm kind of a fan of Lynche's work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's a series of short cartoons that try to show a kind of disturbing and disturbing humor. The animation is very rough, no doubt performed with Macromedia. Every cartoon has a big fat man who beats his family and generally behaves like an idiot for everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For people who are not familiar with this vein of animation, they will probably be somewhat impressed. However, if you spent a lot of time on Newgrounds.com, like me, then these cartoons will be no different from those you've seen before. Many of the famous amateur artists on Newgrounds are doing a lot more work than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch sent this work to the website, then it would merge perfectly with some of the best Newgrounds artists. But since I saw it on DVD, instead of on Newgrounds, I gave it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10, as I would have done otherwise. These cartoons are suitable for the Internet, but with a name like David Lynch, I expected better quality in both history and animation.
