Well, basically, the shots of the movie! It is Blair Witch who meets Sean Penn's ill-conceived fantasy of going to Iraq to show the world what the "war on terror" is. The script sounds like it was written from 8th grade (without offense for eighth grade students); the two main actors overwrite the entire film; they used the wrong type of camera and the wrong kind of film (not that I know anything about those things - but they didn't look like real documentaries I've seen), and the worst of all Christian Johnson took a great idea and did suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog ​​and ended up with a very bad looking figure that looked more like a giant bitch. I'd rather watch Blair Witch VIII than take it back.
