Without a doubt, the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I endured to the end because surely there must be something here, but no. The plot, when it does not deal with common places, walks to the point of non-existence; the dialogue that should be street is simply banal; the characters never develop beyond sketches; set pieces are clich√©s. Worse still, considering his co-director, photography is just so-so. <br /> <br /> Comments elsewhere that raise this along with Get Carter, Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are very far from the brand; Lives of the saints lack their innovation, let alone their depth and nuance. In short, their job. A ruthless publisher could probably reduce it to a decent 30-minute short film, but as it is it is a sixth film project made on a million-pound scale; wandering and swollen with its own pretensions. That he received funding (certainly only for the name of Rankin) while other small films fighting for money is depressing for the British film industry.
