A rather mediocre scifi film. The plot was more or less obvious from the beginning. Although the acting was reasonably good, the script seemed very obvious, using ideas from numerous films. <br /> <br /> The basic plot: the scientists working on a deep space research platform save a warrior from crashing into the red dwarf they were orbiting. On board they find a stasis pod, which has malfunction coincidences at that precise moment. After 2 or 3 minutes the man in the pod wakes up, you realize that he is a complete fool. Something that totally escapes the crew of 3 of the research vessel ... <br /> <br /> After which it becomes a rip-off for every other movie that involves a psychotic madman who terrorizes innocent victims, overall I think Speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I did not consider a good film. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, let Aliens out and watch it again. <br /> <br />
