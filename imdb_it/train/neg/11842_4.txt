Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress. You can always say that he is only "acting". I like Izzard though. The plot is terribly boring. The viewer has no real ties with the characters, never knowing who he really sympathizes with or cares about. Slow, boring movies, with a few laughs, but few and not very funny anyway. The plot is not engaging or full of suspense. You can see each plot turn a mile away. What should this film be like? Comedy? Drama? Who cares? You won't do it at the end of this movie.
