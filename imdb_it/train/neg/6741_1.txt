Seriously, they're all for romantic comedies and they'll end up being sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as good guys ... but this movie? It makes no sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about the voluntary suspension of disbelief that it doesn't make sense. Why does his family live in England? Or at least why doesn't he have a British accent? He is certainly welcoming to his father and is surprisingly forgiving that he hasn't been around for two years. (Regarding this subject, no one has ever made a deal about her leaving for so long). And what was it with the stupid clothes at the bachelorette party? I don't even mean that the escort he paid falls in love with her - which could have been surpassed by better filmmaking. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting and the plot are not rhythmic enough to make a story even a little cohesive. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the director's constant use of the most unflattering corners of Deborah Messing's nose - I would have sued filmmakers if she were you! I mean, honestly, it's all for women who I am, but why, in seven faithful years of seeing Will and Grace, have I ever noticed how strangely strange his nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to you! This film, like my other less favorite film ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time. I'm just glad a friend loaned me his DVD, so all I lost was time. If there was a way to make this ZERO review a protagonist, I'd do it.
