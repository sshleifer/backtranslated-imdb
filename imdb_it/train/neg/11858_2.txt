I'm a Matthew Modine fan, but this film - which I found on the cable - is utterly lacking in intelligence. I see that the writer and the director were all the same, so there was no one around to control his worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. Goldfish was basically the nicest character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days, I have to ask myself how it was made in the first place. And if you're wondering why I saw it, it happened after a movie that I like on cable and I left it while working on the computer. It is not a very challenging photo!
