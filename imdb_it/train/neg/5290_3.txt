Usually I'm not one to film a movie. I try to see the positive points and I don't focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. In my opinion, if you're going to do something so bad, why worry? Part of the film is taken from the shots of Anne's face as she breathes deeply and the music of the violin is played in the background. the other part is full of poor and wooden acting. Rupert Penry Jones is expressionless. Jennifer Higham plays Anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms. Anne is described as mild and shy, which is good at first, but remains unchanged throughout the film, and you can't see why Captain Wentworth falls in love with her. Overall, the production lacks sense of the period, with too many errors to overlook, such as finishing the concert, kissing on the street, running in the streets without a hat (because this scene in the film was entirely? The book scene was a of the most romantic scenes written). To sum up, a terrible film, very disappointing.
