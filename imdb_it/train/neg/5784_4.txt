I was not as in love with this as many other reviewers. Sure, he has a couple of adorable girls playing with erotic and lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two beautiful mermaids with razor teeth that run towards the cars on an off-road road, attack at their home (at sunset) and invite their prey ... sex-hungry men to their boudoir . What happens there ... well, after parting and kissing mostly, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has a few flashes of brilliance with his camera. Some scenes are quite disturbing and actually turned, but sex alone does not hold a movie (no pun intended ... at least consciously). There really isn't much history here. We have the two girls. We are shown an inexplicable and inexplicable beginning where we see them shot with a gun. Why? What does it mean "Why do we have the boy who stays for several days to greet a guy at the hotel who insists he knows him from years ago?" Does it have a purpose? Obviously I still have more general questions like that of a couple of pretty girls who are vampires in the English countryside and who have a cellar full of Carpathian wine? However, the script is full of flaws, but it is also very scarce on the action outside the victims of the catch, the wine and their dinner (literally), and then they go to bed in the crypt. The end takes place with more scenes succulent, but it is anti-clime. There are, as I said, some effective scenes of the director ... I particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods in search of their prey. The house it's also a very impressive set. And both girls are like I told them adorable. Marianne Morris in particular stands out in more than one way. the biggest movie fans, the silent screen veteran Bessie Love has a short cameo at the end of the film.
