'Flight Of Fury' is a boring but terribly boring action film - I don't expect much from a Seagal Film, all I expect is to be moderately amused for 90 minutes with some nonsensical action - unfortunately that doesn't. the few action scenes are few and far between, the plot (which is totally irrelevant in these films) is unnecessarily complicated and confused with huge holes in the plot, The acting is really abysmal - at the embarrassing limit of Seagal and his whisper An expression performance is the best of the 3rd tennis excuse - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12M was spent on this terrible mess unless that $ 11M was Seagal's salary - somehow I doubt it! The only moment of interest for straight or gay guys is that apparently nowhere two hot chick end up in a lesbian sex scene complete with huge baps on display besides that - It's mediocre stuff that is no different from many B-Movies by Michael Dudikoff that I immediately <br /> <br /> 1/10
