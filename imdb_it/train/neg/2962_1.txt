Dinosaur movies can be fun. Then the films Whoopi Goldberg. But Whoopi And the dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I came to a conclusion: this film is evil. Evil, cowardly, wicked and reprehensible in his resentment to the public. Nothing so bad is done by accident; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. <br /> <br /> First of all, Whoopi doesn't make good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers don't care - she's a tough cop here once again . <br /> <br /> Have you seen a million cops this week? Well, here's the number one and a million, man. <br /> <br /> Don't you like cute and humanized animated dinosaurs from that Spielberg show about them? Too bad, here's another one and he too a cop! <br /> <br /> Are you one of those people who hates car chases, shootings, sloppy dialogues, boring futuristic effects and talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax sale? A GREAT tax relief? <br /> <br /> And read this review until the end. You deserve a following. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really make a sequel to "Theodore Rex", Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole bunch of wisely cracked foam dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Now, I would pay to see it.
