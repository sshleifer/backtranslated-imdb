I watched this movie last night and I'm already working to remember a lot about this. The story is about a group of criminals fleeing a space penal colony. They fly to the moon in a litter bin of space trash bins; when there, they terrorize the dustbin that works on the lunar base. <br /> <br /> It strikes me that low-budget science fiction films often involve desert planets or, like this film, criminals who escape from penal colonies. Because I have no idea. But I can say with some confidence that these films are always diabolical. This is really no exception. Start off pretty well with a decent sequence of credits and a soundtrack of dance music halfway. Then it degenerates into a boring science fiction thriller. In this film, in this film, I have very few consequences that I'm literally trying to write a useful review, so if you're reading this I apologize for not being able to enlighten you with the subtleties and nuances of the film. For the record, I remember a boring group of villains, a boring group of goodies, some nuclear warheads and a hologram of a naked woman. Apart from that, I'm struggling. <br /> <br /> If you think you are interested in the activities of the men of the moon dustbin, then I would not hesitate to recommend this film. I would also recommend it to those of you who want to send their friends to sleep and steal their wallets.
