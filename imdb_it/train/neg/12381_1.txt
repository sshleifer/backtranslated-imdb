This film is really vile. He plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s / 80s and places him in a school context. I am not saying that urban crime was not a problem for many people or that schools were not / are not problem areas, but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable, but in this case it is not a case of social problems, but a white student in the upper middle class uses it to turn into the crime boss of his local high schoiol. And of course he knows how to play the system. Sounds familiar. Yes. This asshole is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty job. It is the disturbing brutality dressed by social commentary. This belongs to the same garbage category as Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on and so on. The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broken at the time he had to do things like that.
