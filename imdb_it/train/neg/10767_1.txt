Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC, but easily the worst, without ever seeing the light of day. The director is not even Canadian, but British, and the boy shows it. We are all made to be a group of overcrowded junkies and idiots. The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent, and that should be why we are funding this bunk. Obviously the British character is normal. The rest is a collection of sitcom stereotypes - can you say "Norm !!"? Cinematography ranges from graceful postcard images to dark interior silhouettes. The actors always seem confident. Are you bored like the viewer, or is this the idea of ​​a film director? Avoid this mess and watch some of Bruce Mcdonalds' movies. A real Canadian guy with something original to say cinematically. You won't have to go out on your movies after 10 minutes.
