Having grown up in Texas, less than 15 miles from what Gilley was, I can tell you that this movie is sickening. Most Texans do not live as this film indicates. The plot is weak, and false accents are fun, and reinforces the stereotypical image that all Texans are drinking beer, honky-tonkin ', rednecks. The awful Texas accent is what kills him for me. True, there is a certain touch of Texas in most Texan accents, but these people exaggerate. You can't get anyone from New Jersey and Ohio to make Texan accents. It just doesn't work. John Travolta should have kept to the disco or the 50s. Debra Winger was more convincing than Wonder Girl than Texan.
