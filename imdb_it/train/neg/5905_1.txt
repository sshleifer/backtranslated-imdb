I don't see this was one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. it's hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad view of Mormon life. I can tell you if you've seen this movie that's not all like this in a single department. if it were, I don't think I could get over it. It's a shame that most Mormon movies are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. the acting was so bad that my wife and I barely made it. I guess you can say he had all the signs of a B series movie or is there a C movie? anyway ... i just thought this movie was sucked and it was full of cheese. I would like some Mormons to start making quality films.
