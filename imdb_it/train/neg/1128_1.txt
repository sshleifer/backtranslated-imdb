This film was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure Drivel. How anyone can develop a connection with heroin or empathize with her is beyond me. I seemed to witness a clinical history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. Just terrible. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce and "art" films - except that I could not, for the life of me, find any art in it. <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in today's world, she would have been taken to a mental institution and given a couple of days of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. This, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a purse woman. Because the other characters in this film found something of salvation in her - and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress - she speaks more of their pathology than of any convincing feature that made her deserve this effort.
