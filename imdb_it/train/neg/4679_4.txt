What a scary movie. Don't get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from some interesting pieces, the film is mostly occupied by hysterical sub-sinners who scream, cry, sweat and generally freak out when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it with simple steps to make sure the public still understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairer how he should be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing but a joke) and you have a stupid thriller not worthy of acting. <br /> <br /> We just hope the real US Navy nuclear isn't in the hands of such a script! <br /> <br />
