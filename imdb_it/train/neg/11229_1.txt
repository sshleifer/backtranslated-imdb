They showed me this at school and it was terrible. The film is obsolete. The episodes become confused because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a surprise, but in reality it was a painfully boring experience. I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors, but most of them do what they do in the film in real life. This very often explains the bad acting. Moreover, very often the story becomes slightly outrageous and far-fetched. I don't like the way some lines were written and I wish they had more meaning for them. However, it was written to be educational, fun, full of suspense and fashionable, it ended up being boring, dry, far-fetched and old. I hope nobody has time to watch this movie because you would be well off not seeing it.
