Hard to describe it - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer's films later in the day, you will surely be pleased to see that Haji still looks very hot, although Forry Ackerman has not gone so well (what is he still doing these films anyway? I go to him with a camera, will it be in my movie?). It was a very funny premise - a superhero whose gigantic mammals are his secret weapon - but sometimes it didn't come out the whole length, and the jokes were up to your average comedy Joe E. Brown (o, Abbott and Costello if that's your thing - basically just bad word games. However, I found this film fascinating to watch for more than two reasons. Good work, but a fundamentally fragile production.
