I saw it on a whim because it was available and I had heard that Thumb's movies were fun. This was not. Most of the lines were based on the "Geranium" physicist and, in turn, on Kate Winslet. I think it's really pathetic that the creators of "Thumbtanic" bend so low as to make shots at an authoritative actress just because she (the sky doesn't want to) does not die of hunger in the model of ideal modern beauty. <br /> <br /> My favorite part was the phrase that says something like: "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's go swimming to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of fun on a 26-minute movie does not redeem its value.
