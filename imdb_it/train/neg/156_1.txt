Zu Warriors surely should have been an animated series because as a film it's like watching an old anime on acid. The film starts from nothing and people fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something. If this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this bad wind enters and kills while the razor-winged boy fights some other mystical thing God / Demon / Wizard The plot is not there or extremely difficult to follow you must be madly smart to get this movie. The plot soon follows this mortal Chinese who is called by this god to fight the flight of evil, the princess kills the villain and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a complete terrible fight scene martial arts on a mountain or something. Even the images are strange, some might say that they are incredible and colorful, but I'm going to say that they are blurry and acid journey like (yes, it's a word!). I looked at both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand .... who I'm kidding I didn't understand at all. I felt like I was watching the 30s anime episode of the 80s and I completely missed how the story started or as if I started reading a series of 5 comics at number 4 because I had no idea how this thing was started where it went or how it would end I can honestly say this was one of the worst cinematic experiences ever, like watching drunk Inu-Yasha ... yes, that's right, you don't know what the hell is going on. Don't waste your brain trying to figure it out.
