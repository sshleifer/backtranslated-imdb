A bad attempt at "Seven", complete with sub-second-grade acting, bad camera work, fiery history and a strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, their "sexual offenders", they live in the next room and you will be raped, really. <br /> <br /> No surprise from the vice-terminator woman, she acts as always - convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slide lower and lower - and he is more or less here as a deceased Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer with crazy eyes is best when she died in bed; and even the wolf was undertone (although he was the best performer in the film) - maybe they fed her before the shots, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which had a (up, but interesting) story, which could be referred to more or less independently of the country, this film seems to focus on a US obsession only . If one does not care much about "sexual offenders" - and the statistics are that lack of exercise and poor nutrition cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see it or to be afraid. <Br /> <br /> There are some fetishes of the body part and some snuff, but the gore is less mediocre, and fails both as an artistic device (because it is useless) and as a gore, because it is not bloody enough. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this.
