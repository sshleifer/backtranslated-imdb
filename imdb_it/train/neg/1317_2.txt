When the people of Kino Video assembled their beautiful collection "Slapstick Encyclopedia", a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to start the first episode with ONE TOE MANY (1916), a dark farce to a reel made in Florida by the very young Oliver Hardy. As nice as the set is, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film that almost discourages the viewer from looking beyond. Like any typical farce, this includes deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go wrong and complications grow to absurdity, but unlike the good ones, ONE TOO MANY is inconsistent, unattractive and downright annoying. At this point it is difficult to say if the hopelessly confused plot is the result of missing footage or inept films, but whatever the cause, even the most attentive spectator has no idea at the halfway what the character relationships are or what is happening and in the end you don't care anymore. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest here is to see the 24 year old "Babe" Hardy, who appears much heavier than he would have done a decade later, when he collaborated with Stan Laurel, but who is nevertheless full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, the awakening with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic roll-back from a bed. Trust me, it's fun like this movie. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I suggest you go ahead quickly and skip the good stuff.
