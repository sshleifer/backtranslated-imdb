Despite the positive reviews and screenings of international festivals, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is very similar to other films, in which a girl from the immigrant family needs to overcome many common problems of her age, and also to fight against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. He does this by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, who for some reason falls in love with her, faces his problems and wins. <br /> <br /> In Girlfight is boxing, in Piegalo as Beckham is football, and now it's Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> But Fighter is a product much inferior to these two, it was simply embarrassing to see it. Semra Turan, the "actress" who plays the role of a teenager, may be able to do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is act. His screen presence is anemic and clumsy, dramatic situations, in which he tries to show some emotions, are terrible, his body and face language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they can't save this clich√© movie with stereotyped characters and superficial plot. In addition to a few relatively positive moments, this film has nothing new or interesting to offer. <br /> <br /> Even kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch it, it's so boring. The slow movement was really superfluous, the choreography was basic and lacked inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes were training or standing in all kung-fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it is when a small, thin girl fights big, muscular boys, and drives them away from their feet. <br /> <br /> The only reason this film has been noticed is because it is European. It is very easy to advertise this film - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it isn't. It's just a drama about the stupid teenager and her problems, which, by the way, are not really convincing. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with embarrassing jokes, acting and history.
