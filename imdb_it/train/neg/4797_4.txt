After the mafia boss Vic Moretti (late great Anthony Franciosa) kills his lady who betrayed him with Derek, their new Vietnamese driver / veteran, and blames the poor boy, Derek finds himself in prison where he has to to deal with a corrupt guardian, a prisoner brother of Vic who runs the prison, and, oh yes, illegal experiments conducted by a shady CIA agent (such a great parent and first director John Saxon) to turn several prisoners into super invincible zombies -umani. Of course things get out of hand and it's up to Derek and the rest of the prisoners unchanged, save the day after the infected bring the prison. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a very talented actor and as a director, Saxon is a ... a very talented actor. To say that this film (the only directorial release of John so far) lacks a certain visual style would be a bit simplistic. However, the film is not entirely worthless. The dialogue, even if idiotic, is ugly enough to be funny at times. Unfortunately, this is not enough to make the film go on from this alone and it takes film forever to start coming into his (which is rather late in the film). Consequently, the best I can recommend this film is to say that if you are a Saxon fan (which is actually me), it is worth looking at a watch, come in with low expectations and you should be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure become topless <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
