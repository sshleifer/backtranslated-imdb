I saw this film for a project about love. please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what his character would look like and then re-read the lines he is saying. My life can't go on ... I cut my own hand by mistake ... my brother was close. Obviously it's his fault. And since they have happy endings included the good guy who takes care of sad and lonely mom. No closure, invalid script and does not have a sufficient extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless you have a good laugh. The costumes were made appropriately, and the extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but to keep it more specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who knows it, because it's not an intellectual film. It's not a chicken shot. It is not a rigorous romantic. And I can't show children because of sex and questions to follow. All in all, not really a good movie.
