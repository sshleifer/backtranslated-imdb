I was really disappointed with this movie. it started very well and created a great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally came to reveal the "monster" ... it turned out to be just a fool with skin problems ...... again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another cock-sucker movie ... as if we didn't already have enough. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the "creep" is really creepy to look at, and the way it moves and the strange sounds it's pretty terrifying, but I'm sick of renting movies like this just to find out that the monster is human, even if tense, demented, bizarre. When I saw all the revealing rats in the early stages, I was hoping for some kind of strange hybrid thing of mouse monsters ... it was such a disappointment when the Creep was revealed. <br /> <br /> this, some of the things in this film make no sense. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why the hell does the Creep kill the security guard? What's the point, besides sticking a big horn that says "HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE HERE!"? It's stupid, and it seems that only by chance does it prevent the character of Franka Potente from getting help. <br /> <br /> What hells did you eat there? I had the impression that it was actually walled up inside, and only the unexpected opening in that section of the tunnel left him free ... so he was munching the mice all that time, and if so why surround him so much? Why is it so damn hard to kill? He is thin, malnourished and not really at peak performance ... but he seems to continue despite the injuries that are equivalent to those that suppress the non-psycho characters of the film. <br /> <br /> The comment on the DVD says that we are meant to empathize with Creep, but I find it disgusting. It's a pretty effective film, but it has wasted so many opportunities that it hurts me.
