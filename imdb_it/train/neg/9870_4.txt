I had several problems with the film: <br /> <br /> (1) The script - in particular, Kim Basinger's voice on: Films are not books; should * show * the action rather than have a voice over * tell us * what's going on. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice that works, but here it seemed more like a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it seemed to me that he was practically reading excerpts from the novel with his voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I didn't feel any emotion in the relationship between Jessie and her brother Thomas and I also heard that Alex Carter's acting was pretty bad. This is a serious failure for me to define the characters of Jessie and Thomas - without any connection between them, it seemed to me that he wanted only a stallion and that for him it was a matter of being deprived of sex. If it had been done correctly, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. It felt more like boredom in the film. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I didn't think the movie was so bad that it turned off the TV. . . even if that thought occurred to me.
