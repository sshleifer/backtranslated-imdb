The whole world has said that the film Tashan would be a good movie with great pleasure, but this is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake in taking Kareena Kapoor as an actress. It was unbearable throughout the film. His tom-boy appearance is not really good. Even the film, the film's story makes no sense. Everyone said that the Quetin Taratino of India is Vijay, but it is not Quetin at all. Anil Kapoor's talent was involved in this stupid film. Anil is an actor of great caliber and this film is not. Akshay Kumar was also a victim of this film because everything is Saif. The style and the Phoormola are not very good in this film I was disappointed
