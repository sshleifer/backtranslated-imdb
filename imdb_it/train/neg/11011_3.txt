A series of painfully perfect scenes that seem to go on forever and one day. Not so terribly terrible as saying "Freddy Got Fingered" or "Lost Reality", but that in no way is an endorsement in ANY way, sense or form. Presents the worst clown in rhyme ever. Most if not offensive to anyone but the most modest or politically correct. It also has the worst parody of a song ever worn on film, the worst imitation of Arnold EVER (not just the worst movie, literally the worst ever). I have no idea why Karen Black, Michael Clarke Duncan, or Slash would have been the protagonists of this (the reasons why I saw it in the first place) The only slightly funny thing was Dickman. In conclusion, I would NOT recommend this film to ANYONE, but the people who are doing their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic. Do something remarkable with you human lives. Moreover if it is true that the Church of Scientalogia hates it, it cannot be EVERYTHING badly. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
