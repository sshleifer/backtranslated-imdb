The film had a nice opening, I really thought I was in one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a while ... there was something special "foreign" about the way the film was set, realistic but somewhat abstract and mystical. But then the plot has become increasingly unrealistic. To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would be almost an understatement ... The typically romantic ending where everything goes great for every "nice" character. A scene in which the main character realizes he made a mistake and chases the "woman of his dreams" only to confess his love for her in front of a loving crowd of spectators. Come on. In the end, the "good guys" win, the "bad guys" get lost ... Get the picture. A WASTE of a potentially interesting film.
