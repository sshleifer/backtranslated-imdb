A warship is sinking ... Its survivors, hanging from a nearby life raft, sit there doing nothing as we enter each of their minds for a series of long flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Even if the name of Noel Coward is the only one that you notice during the credits, everything that is cinematographic is due to Lean. And in technical terms, it's very good. David Lean only makes a KNEW film from the beginning. There are many moments when the dialogue studied by Coward takes second place and Lean's visual sense is the center of attention. Try the soldiers to get off the ship towards the end and that whole scene; the twist to the singing anthem, the scene in which we are inside a house that is bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. It is totally made of wood, shows no emotions, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he's not really listening to what the other actor is saying, he's just waiting for them to finish so he can run his own line. <br /> <br /> 7/10. <Br /> <br /> His episodic, a bit repetitive, and the flashbacks overwhelm the story: there is no central story that advances, just give an overview of the characters. Still, it's an interesting watch worthy of a watch - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating film, and it's definitely a propaganda film, but it's also a showcase for Lean's editing skills - it's all about how the pieces are put together.
