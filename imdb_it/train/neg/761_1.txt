Absolute garbage The reason this is so terrible is not because it deviated from the formula, but because the plot was just pathetic. <br /> <br /> The alleged star did nothing to solve the case - and nobody really did any - it was just a routine police job. Absolutely boring. <br /> <br /> You sat up to the end hoping for a breakthrough - and you got nothing but a huge sense of disappointment. <br /> <br /> There was so much potential in having a relative apparently kidnapped. Could the personal involvement of the LT finally obfuscate his judgment? <br /> <br /> All the obvious signs were of a stranger who did it. But surely a genius like Lt C, through constant conversation with the offended husband, will gradually discover a diabolical plot involving a tape recorder playing in the shower while a masked groom surprises the bride, hides the body and then plants subtle clues. It may have been good. It was a complete waste of time.
