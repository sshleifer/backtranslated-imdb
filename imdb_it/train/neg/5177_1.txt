This is so ugly, so very bad. Acting is the biggest joke in history. I don't even care to see it, I did it after 20 minutes and it was just as disappointing in the end as it was at the beginning ... I don't really understand people's tastes, I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm not meticulous but I have a LIMIT! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better than the beginning of Hoast, but that's all. So I advise you not to waste the 15 minutes you will be able to see. I mean, acting is best done by monkeys. And the older brother with the role of the parents is simply horrible. Don't pay characters in C movies? No, I must say that it is not the first time that I think a horror film is ugly, but it is absolutely one in my ten films and that they will be meeting places with Portrait of a vampire, Cabin in the lake, The Hoast!
