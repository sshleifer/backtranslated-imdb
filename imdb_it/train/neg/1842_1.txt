This is my first film review on IMDb. I was forced to register after seeing this movie. I cannot, in good conscience, allow this film to be reviewed by me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") <br /> <br /> I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, yet, I hated this movie. There's a plot, but who cares if there's not a script. Dialogue is unreal and boring, situations are invented, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the characters are indifferent and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good premise, is stupid. This film is a bit of a poop. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about wasting MONEY in this movie, it's not even worth spending your time looking at it. Please don't see it ... please!
