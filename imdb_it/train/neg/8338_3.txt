This film is very important because it suggested this consideration: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to have a syndrome ... sometimes, for example, you may want to have Goldfield syndrome ... just like you 'I don't remember this boring movie ... and above all you won't remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler ... sometimes, you can simply wish ... to have rented another movie ... <br /> My vote? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are not a fan of boring romantic comedies or Adam Sandler (... it's a joke, Adam Sandler's fan doesn't exist ... I want to hope), saved ... Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... Maybe.
