This film was like a bad train accident, as horrible as it was, you had to keep watching. My boyfriend and I rented it and lost two hours of the day. Now don't get me wrong, the acting is good. Only the film as a whole was both furious. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie, I had to go and rent something else that was a little lighter. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. His character seems manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, even though it's over, does a great job interpreting her situation. More than once I found myself screaming on TV telling her to react or become violent. All in all, a very violent film ... not for the faint of heart.
