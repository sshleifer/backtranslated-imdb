The only redeeming quality of this film is that it was bad enough to be comic. Everyone in this film seems to be abandoning the porn industry. Actually, I've seen better acting in low budget porn. Although in reality I had rented some kind of gay porn after this classic scene: Jim: look at your ass Nick: look at yours (together): I won't leave you behind! <br /> <br /> The first sequence of actions shows how terrible the production is, but it's really fun: the good guys have transformer weapons! In one scene, they all have false HK MP5 machine guns. Next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, to top it all off, do some weapon by swapping the scenes with a pair of M-16s !! I think they had a shortage of arms budgets, not enough to get around between the good and the bad. The fight scenes are poorly coordinated and fake like everyone else. You have to remove the pin / spoon from a grenade to explode by itself. It is not possible to launch a missile thrown over the shoulder of any kind while driving inside a helicopter. The weapons you throw away don't suddenly reappear. When a gun is out of bullets, throwing it away is still pretty stupid. Unless you have no idea how to reload them .. The big slow-moving front-row trucks create awkward action scenes. I can't really believe that movies like this are actually produced. This film would be hilarious on nitric oxide or maybe just drunk.
