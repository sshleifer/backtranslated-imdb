I was at the premiere of this film at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer / director and some cast members offered to answer questions, nobody would even bother asking anyone. Rarely has a film been directed so badly (why on earth were there random frames torn from some scenes?), It has unfortunately acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not manage the emotional range from A to B. Park in A and bring a lunch) and absolutely useless. Characters behave completely outside the character for no reason, except to force the plot to move in certain directions. In the end, the film comes to a completely random and useless end that should "really make you think". Unfortunately, what makes you think is, "Well, there are 90 minutes of my life that I will never return".
