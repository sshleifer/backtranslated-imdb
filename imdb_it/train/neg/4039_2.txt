There are two types of characters in THE SHIELD: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing and people who relentlessly pursue their personal interest and commit any mortal sin they can while telling themselves and others that they are heroes and the only hope of all. More than any other show, THE SHIELD speaks of hypocrisy and self-illusion. Unfortunately, the hypocrites and the self-disappointing are the heroes of the shows, and as such they have the improbable immunity of the heroes of genre novels to be defeated or captured and come out on top of infinity, making their peers crazy. <br /> <br /> The show boasts excellent photographic work. Leads and fades are always exceptional. It is truly a work of art to behold. Unfortunately, the story is a comic book, the setting for the creation of exaggerated dreams of gratuitous violence, rape and lies. <br /> <br /> The hero, who drags everyone with him into a failed scheme after a failed scheme, is wiley as a warner bros cartoon character, always on the run and making fun of all the elves (anyone not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting every good-looking woman to support the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice and ALWAYS scraping his ears with his atrocious self-justifications. If another policeman discovers something wrong with something he is doing, and someone is injured because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of whether his plans, elaborate lies and condemned plans are always the cause. Whenever. <br /> <br /> Like 24, this show is based on tricks and countless delays to drag its story off season after season. Boring and incredible long-term stories are injected into the plot every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody and perverted pieces of meat that are the corrupt actions of the characters and the inevitable concealments. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing, however, is the arrogance of the writers as they try to change the sympathy of the spectators back and forth, and to form the characters with whims. Sometimes, they want us to see Shane as the enemy. Sometimes they want us to see it as a poor misunderstood soul. Sometimes they want us to see Vic as a dangerous sexual dynamo. Sometimes they want us to see him as a poor boy with a heart of gold. Sometimes they want us to see Mara as a vile Jezebel. Then they think that if they show her sitting and talk about her dreams with Shane, we will find her understanding and tragic. <br /> <br /> None of these manipulations are adequate to get the kind of sympathy they want. Once they have shown that these characters ruin the lives of others for their purposes, that's all. It makes no sense to keep trying to flip back and forth. But then, it's also absurd to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns by designing each existing super model at their beds and running a criminal syndicate right outside the police station, right under everyone's nose.
