This is only the second time I've interrupted a video / DVD in part. <br /> <br /> I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at the beginning, even if it managed to be both superficial, clich√© and stupid .. And without joy, tiring and pretentious. <br /> <br /> He was like an After School Special run by that bizarre nine-year-old who thinks nobody understands him ... creepy and sad, with a voice-over that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry ... and a little singing, and ... no, really, the poor child is suffering ... <br /> <br /> Enough, already, especially when he turned into a brash, awkward, and insulting anger Clockwork Orange. And did I mention the song? <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but certainly the one I felt less forced to sit. I don't recommend it to anyone.
