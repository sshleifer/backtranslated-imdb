If you want to take a look at a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision" is a horrible film. Horrible production values. Terrible act. Horrible screenplay I would not recommend this film to be seen by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances the awareness of the American Asian in Hollywood (this film does nothing else). <br /> <br /> I would at least say that this movie is passable for entertainment on a rainy day, if you happen to meet him while you are surfing the channel. If you're curious, maybe rent from Netflix, but this movie is not at all sure. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who have seen this film as a means of raising awareness of Asian American cinema and have been disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal vision. These are well-written films with high production values ​​that include a talented cast of Latin American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
