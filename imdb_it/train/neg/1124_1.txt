The opening shot was the best thing about this film, because it gave you the hope that you would see an independent and passionate movie. Damn that opening blow for having filled me with hope. While the "film" progressed slowly and laboriously, my thoughts were different in relation to this "film": was there too much butter in my popcorn? Did the actors have to PAY the director to be in this "movie"? Did I get my ticket validated at the box office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This would be the only exception I will make about watching a movie at home at the cinema, because at home you can TURN IT OFF. Were there ransom values? Peter Lemongelli as the standard college nerd had his moments, especially in a dog collar. Apart from this, this "film" has gone from trying to be a comedy to a drama familiar to a spiritual uplifter. He failed on any of these fronts. Oh, and the girl was really bad. His performance was the only comedy I found.
