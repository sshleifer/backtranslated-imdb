As someone who has read the book, I can say that this is far less than the great American version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. There are several reasons for this. First of all, Emma is too unpleasant. Yes, it has flaws, and it is not the easiest person to love - but the viewer should definitely not start to despise it. Secondly, Mr. Knightly is a mixture. His brooding and melancholy in this version are more suited to an adaptation of Bronte or Gaskell than to those of Austen, and cast the atmosphere of the whole affair "outside". Third, Samantha Morton is an actress too strong to be relegated to the role of Harriet; and why was it made to look so unhealthy? Harriet should be blonde and in full bloom - not to seem as if she had been taken away by consumption in the next scene. Fourth, the structure was put in order and the scenes were cut. In the end, when Emma decides to love Mr. Knightly, it looks absolutely disconcerting because this narrative has not been adequately shown and continued throughout the film. Fifth, what exactly was happening with Mrs Elton's accent? It went from looking like an American actress trying to suppress her accent at the beginning, to the whole half-American world, and then again in English at the end. In the end, this was dragged to the end. The book and the version of the great film conclude with the marriage of Emma and Mr. Knightly. This version drags on confusedly after the announcement of the marriage without actually showing us the ceremony. <br /> <br /> All in all, a rather random attempt. Read the book or rent the version of Paltrow
