I rented it by mistake. I thought, after a quick examination of the box, that this was a story of time travel / science fiction. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it's a fairly typical example. If you are sold on the message you will probably neglect the embarrassment of the plot / acting / etc., but I found it rather painful. <br /> <br /> I must admit that I am annoyed by the rewriting of the story in this story. He painted the 1890s as a kind of paradise of family values ​​and morality (a character is astonished that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But neglects the very unpleasant sides of this "highly moral" society and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point the hero complains to the owner of a clothing store about things that don't seem very different from the complaints of some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ). <br /> <br /> I thought, I suppose it's the kind of thing you'll like if you like this kind of thing, and it's definitely healthy ...
