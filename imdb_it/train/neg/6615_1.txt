Once in a while in Indian cinema comes a film like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And den only once in a while (hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of his own. Such a low standard can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a talented crucible and create a dish so old that he can hear it from a distance. Taking a classic like Sholay and murdering him is absolutely unforgivable and I can't believe he almost called RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folk elements, the film managed to build on his plot simply by defining the characters in such a peculiar way that they lived forever. What Aag does is take these characters and make them pissed off so badly that you'll need a contest to pick the worst. The element of realism is totally missing and what the film ends up providing is a group of "actors" who parade in a plot of less apparently independent events. A star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. it's time that RGV realizes the reality of its failure and evokes another "different" plot that can be classified under the cinema.
