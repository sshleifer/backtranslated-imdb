The only redeeming part of this film was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $ 3.00 and time spent sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was responsible for the continuity lost the boat. When the female protagonist and the FBI guy went to the alleged position of the murderers, Mr. FBI handed the woman a revolver. When the alleged killer came out of the door, the revolver magically turned into an automatic. One is left to reflect on a FBP agent to give a civilian a weapon? I do not think so. Mrs. Xavier seems to be a very attractive woman. It is a pity that the R rating does not allow it to see it much. It would seem that an editor has cut what could be the best parts of the film.
