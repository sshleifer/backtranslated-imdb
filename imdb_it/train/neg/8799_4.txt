Congratulations on the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room every day to watch Zola's part. Muni was one of the greatest stars of the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - more than classic cinema fans - know something about it. He had been a giant in business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, winning him for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My opinion is that while he tended to do some recounting, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Any part has interpreted; you were nailed to the screen to watch it. <br /> <br /> Unlike the role of Pasteur, I thought this story had a bit too much of what we have seen over the last 60 years: exaggerate to create a liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood failed to repress his contempt for the police or the military, and here he wanted to tell us how "corrupt" those organizations were. Filmmakers love it only when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film has been far ahead of its day since we saw this great event from the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it should be noted that the facts support this story. Moreover, Zola's achievements as a social reformer by eliminating certain evils do not diminish in any way. Good for him! I would have liked them to have spent more time demonstrating it than focusing on a test.
