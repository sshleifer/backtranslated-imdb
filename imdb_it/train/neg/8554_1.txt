The film was, in all likelihood, made in the year 1930 and published in 1931. I imagine that talking about films had great difficulties in moving from the silent era. However, this particular Zane Gray plot seems to be very weak. Furthermore, Gary Cooper was probably learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable by today's standards. For 1931, perhaps. For 2004, not acceptable. Some actors have played well. Unfortunately, Indians always get the short end in these early Westerners. They lived on earth long before the white man arrived, but according to a distorted story, they had no right to defend themselves.
