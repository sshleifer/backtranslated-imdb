For the record, this film is intriguing but not original. In 1998 a film starring Talia Shire entitled The Landlady had almost the same plot but with younger characters. <br /> <br /> The story is that Amanda Lear has had a bad life, violent father, horny doctor, nursing homes, etc. In the end she was released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctor ... that she abuses and kills the poor boy. (now THAT it was original) The doctor had financed a villa for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the back yard. After moving in, she falls in love with a stallion named Richard, who is just married to a blues singer. If you've seen The Landlady, you know the rest, kill or try to kill anyone who intrudes between you and Richard (including a roadie). <br /> <br /> Much of the idea came from the previous film, The same idiot colleague who sticks his nose, himself spying on the boy with a bowl of popcorn, the same one that beats a bodypress. It had some original material, the thing about the beer bottle was brutal. The highlight of the film was Amanda's beautiful breast in the hot-top scene. A little repudiation but not a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
