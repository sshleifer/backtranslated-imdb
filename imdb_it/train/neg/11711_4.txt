An ok film, with a beautiful head lady, but a terrible guide man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the husband, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the saving grace of the film. He is the best actor in the group. <br /> <br /> NOTE * the first comment, from the colleague who praised the film (and, according to his IMDB.com account, he wrote only ONE review - and guess which movie?) is obviously a plant. While the film is well shot, it is not subtle or grandiose at all or any other hypobolic description used by the reviewer. <br /> <br /> "Art of Revenge" is an honest film, but it's a great tease. It offers all kinds of sexual situations, but it never does. How to watch a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the "bad pieces" cut. <br /> <br /> The film as a whole is a bit blurry and the ending, and much of the third act, is really a big mess. There is a final, of course, since each film nowadays considers it necessary to end a turn. <br /> <br /> A 4 on 10. <br /> <br />
