We loved School of Rock and Jack Black. We couldn't wait to see this movie. It was the only time in my life that the movie was so bad that I wanted to go out. My husband hated it too. The only fun parts were in trailers. My husband and I wanted to stay out of the cinema and tell people to save their money. The writing was terrible. He had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people that should be completely offended. The film was not so long but for us it seemed like an eternity. The people in the theater were so restless and silent that it was like looking at dry paint. I forced my husband to stay because I was sure there would be some parts that were saved, but they weren't there. Save money and time.
