Argh! this film hurts my head. and not in a positive sense. <br /> <br /> maybe it's just my growing hatred for the kind of action, but even as a child when I swallowed tripe as a Navy Seals, I considered this film with dislike. now I despise it completely. <br /> <br /> take a fairly quick story. keep the title and throw away the rest. instead he uses a plot of the future of the half-absurd gladiators that is so full of holes in the plot that he risks collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras?) because they clearly marked the video of what really happened in Bakersfeild in an unattended room?) <br /> <br /> the whole movie screams eighty years, from the triumphal soundtrack to the stupid costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> don't watch this movie. I know someone liked it, but some people start peeing and I don't even understand them.
