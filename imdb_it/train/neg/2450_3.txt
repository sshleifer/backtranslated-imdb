I saw Peter Jackson's version of Peter of the Lord when I was halfway through reading the Two Towers and thought it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At this point the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I will finish reading the Two Towers and the Return of the Kings before looking at it (as I thought he had shown the whole trilogy ). <br /> <br /> So when I finished the trilogy I went and brought the DVD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish. <br /> <br /> I literally got bored 20 minutes, which was really weird because I love the book and I'm shocked that the creator of this movie might even think about putting at least 1 and a half of the books in a film of 2 hours and 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> None of the characters had emotions when they talked and looked like reading a page, even my favorite character who is Gandalf does not seem interesting at all. <br /> <br /> Animation was the only thing right in some parts of the film except for the orcs (they looked horrible) and for Aragorn and Sam. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this film was released because there wasn't even a suitable ending, but maybe it was good that the producer had run out of money because the film couldn't be improved. <br /> <br /> I just hope no one will judge the books in this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
