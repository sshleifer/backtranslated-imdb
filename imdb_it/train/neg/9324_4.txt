OK, I own this DVD, I took it to the new one in the Amazon ... I mean, I think it's crazy and a very cool and melissa bale movie the slutty girl they take is hot as hell ... acting sucks and everything polt sucks the clown is a huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but okay i wouldn't recommend it if i wanted to rent a good funny movie after a hard day's work and you're obsessed with these stupid movies like me, watch it sometimes, and I don't know how the crafted DVD has SICK in its sick DVD collection it's not good enough to be owned by a decent film company halfway OK, that's it
