Sean Bean is fantastic, as are photography, places and customs. However, the plot is a bit confusing and the conclusion is flat. The plot was SUBSTANTIALLY modified by the Cornwell novel and not for the better. Unfortunately, this adventure is much more useful than watched. Sharpe was too narrow here, in contrast to his literary alter ego, which seems more intelligent and determined despite his apprehension in his new role as an officer promoted by the ranks. I really liked the short scene in which Sharpe stumbled from a "real" officer, and after a quick pause and a penetrating look, pushes the surprised and intimidated officer back. Set the tone for your next rehearsal as commanding officer. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: "4" of "10."
