Grand Central Murder (1942) Dir: S. Sylvan Simon <br /> Production: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre "B" mystery was one of only five films released in 1942 with Simon as a director. Surely he could have mounted another Red Skelton movie or two on his program! In any case, Grand Central Murder is a shameless scam of the films of Thin Man, without the humor, charm and chemistry of the protagonists. We are treated with a subtle plot that can barely sustain its 73 minutes, bad acting and tired gags. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray play Nick and Nora Char - er, Rocky and Butch Custer. He is a private investigator and is his wife and investigating partner. They engage in "humorous" jokes with each other. To see? It's already completely different. Heflin is the only one here to suggest bigger and better things, even though he is very close to being an idiot in this. Virginia Gray was in Another Thin Man, but again, let me point out, THIS FILM IS NOT LIKE THAT, no sir. And in the event that we start thinking that this film is absolutely not the same as another film (for example THE THIN MAN) that we like, Sam Levene appears as the protagonist detective who is a little weak and must have Van Heflin directed towards of him all the important leads. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Quickly, the "murder" is that of the evil intriguing Midas King, who likes to trade with rich men until he finds an even richer one. It is played by Patricia Dane, who is like a C version of Hedy Lamarr, until she opens her mouth and turns into a F. There is a whole host of extravagant suspicions, all with their motivations for wanting Mida dead. There is the kind of society, the tough talking lady, the hooligan, the ex-lover and a shady theater manager (Tom Conway, here fascinated by the unlikely name of the character of "Frankie Ciro"). Roman Bohnen plays a nervous and nervous type, something I think he may have done before. Millard Mitchell plays an idiotic cop who, in a gag that doesn't want to stop, can't stop thinking about the piece of ass that is waiting for him once this case has ended (yes, Millard Mitchell, swordsman). Finally, in a completely innovative method of storytelling, something we have never seen before, all the suspects are gathered in a place where they tell their stories (like flashbacks) to the detective, while Rocky takes mental notes, until finally the guilty person she is forced to make a dramatic confession. <br /> <br /> On top of the real image is a real disaster, I naively thought that there could be a couple of location photos of the actual 1942 Central Grand, but alas, no. There is only one very short stroke in the beginning. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. So to sum up, a little formidable, but Heflin was fine. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
