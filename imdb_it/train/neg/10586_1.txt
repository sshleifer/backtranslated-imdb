This is a well-made informative film in the wake of PBS Frontline. The problem is that Frontline has already made this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer to tell his version of the story. More worrying is the fact that the film's director, Charles Ferguson - a former tank thinker, was a supporter of the war until the occupation moved south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went very well until it was messed up by those annoying Nazis. And this is what this film looks like - an apology for the occupation rather than a deconstruction of the very act of war. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war could have been better managed - as if every war could be better.
