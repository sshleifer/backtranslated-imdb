"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon and a year later he came out of the jungle ... naked, it took 45 years to go back." Presumably, "Keep the river on your right" is "a modern cannibal story". In reality, anyone looking for a vision of cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the film is more like a New Ginuea travel journal, mainly to solicit native art. The second part is based on photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but in reality it is all here. Unless, of course, you don't care about the home movies of a Jewish wedding or Schneerbaum presenting his former male lovers. I give up. Big disappointment and not really "a modern cannibal story". - MERK
