Thanks to this film, I can now answer the question "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" <br /> <br /> I can't even think of a second up close, and I've seen some really bad movies. <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing works in this film. Assign a single element to any horror movie and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here are some typical dialogues: <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this isn't funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "ARggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
