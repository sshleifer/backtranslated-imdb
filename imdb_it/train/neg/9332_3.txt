It's not a terrible film, really, and Glenn and Keitel are first-rate actors. Furthermore, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. Furthermore, I understand why these actors and the crew made the film, they are professionals and are paid for it. But I wonder why the studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't publish it for a theater audience? Even if a movie is a box office flop, it certainly makes money. If you're a Keitel or Glenn fan, rent the video or take it on TV, like I did. Of course, the film will not help solve the immigration dilemma with Mexico, but the experience is far better than 90% of today's TV tariff standard.
