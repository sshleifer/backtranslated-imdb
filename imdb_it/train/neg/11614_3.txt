The Lady in Cement is a real course of social anthropology of the late 1960s. Writing, not acting, is at the center of the scene. I said - pure field! Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. Broad and drafts are standard terms and the bait and gay torment are represented for what they were during the day (in a field sense). Most lines are tossed around, although there are wonderful performances by very few prominent actors. Action scenes are trivial but it's fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes tough guys. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the peak of their career. Incredible to note that they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53 years old. The soundtrack, wait. . . was there a score? Well, you understand the point. Watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them.
