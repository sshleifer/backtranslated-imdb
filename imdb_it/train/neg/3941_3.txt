Is this what happens when you live in China and the local video store is running out of titles in English? You are blessed with this work of what appears to be, yes, Romanian cinema. Nevertheless, I think it has real comic potential. <br /> <br /> Spooflers technically follow: <br /> <br /> Although I don't think it would actually ruin anyone's pleasure in wondering why the movie set in a casino has a shooting scene with the beach arch, even in flashbacks. That mystery, and many other puzzles, remain to be exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. <br /> <br /> I also wonder aloud why perfectly handsome people allow themselves to abuse films like this. Is sad.
