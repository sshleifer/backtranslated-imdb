I liked the initial premise of this film which is what prompted me to hunt him down but the problem I immediately discovered is that you know better what will happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the doubles will come from behind the mirror and take everyone's control). <br /> <br /> There is no real turning point (which is fine), but the final revelation does not make much sense (as can be tormented by uncertainty and fear for the whole film, if you are an evil id from beyond the mirror?) <br /> <br /> He admits that the scenes "beyond the mirror" were chilling when they first appeared and even the murder of the blonde is actually disturbing, but in the end it seems to be a movie at searching for a story or a more captivating script, heaping atmospheres and frightening atmospheres, but for 80-90 minutes the scary sound design doesn't cut it, on the contrary, it becomes rather boring.
