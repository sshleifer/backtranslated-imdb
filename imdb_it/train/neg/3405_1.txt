I can't believe how uncultivated this movie is. It's like watching the police academy, except for people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot that should be a companion. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but this is only complete stupidity. Not only is there no plot for this film. It's like watching someone pretending to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words around like they're the head of a large medical facility staff. In addition, people wear clothes that are not suitable for a space program. I feel like I'm watching a "b" movie of the girls of the valley, in space.
