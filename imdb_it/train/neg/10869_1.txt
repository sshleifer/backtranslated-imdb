A friend of mine loaned me this video and I was pretty excited to see it, but after ten minutes of slow voice from James Hetfield and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I started thinking, "Because I'm Sto looking at this? That question will scroll through your minds in 5 to 10 minutes after you press Play, I returned the tape the same day, as you might expect, it's not worth buying or watching it! <br /> <br /> Solo my opinion! <br /> <br />
