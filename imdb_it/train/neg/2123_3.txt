I go to UCSB and take classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She's a superb teacher and director, so whatever she put her name on, I thought she should be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice. <br /> <br /> While this film included some good shots and cinematography, the lack of history and consistency really took away everything he was trying to do. to achieve. My main problem was that this was someone's first film and of course it could be said. Bad acting and an even worse script prevented this film from taking off. The soundtrack had good music that gave the impression that the main characters struggle to bear the sadness that led to his departure and that he is now returning to the place where he grew up. I just have to say that, despite some of the film's best techniques, it is the lack of stories and the performances that have really prevented it from being a good example.
