SEX WISH was actually released (minus ten more minutes, er, "extreme" movies) here in the UK in the early days of the video boom and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it presumably inspired a murder case culpable. Strangely, the newspapers have touched on this ultra-disturbing film under the rug in their rush to get the relatively harmless types of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON in a box, and the film was almost forgotten as a result. I jumped at the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the movie with the jaw on the floor. It is not so much politically incorrect as completely demented, a triple X that takes Michael Winner's DEATH WISH (did the title give away the game with regards to inspiration?) With hardcore sex and some really unpleasant violence thrown into a already boiling infusion of the seventies. If you don't consider yourself picky, this could force you to think again. When SEX WISH is finished, you will want to rub your eyes with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to cleanse yourself. If a film truly deserves the tag line "it's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie", that's it. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist who uses a vibrator on a victim while masturbating on her, the mustache stolen from the scene of Harry Reems, the defenseless young black couple who are forced to fuck in front of her to the killer of the sword (they would have won the Oscars for their absolutely believable performances if the Academy had gone mad) before the man is castrated for his troubles, and some unpleasant slippery direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious origins of millstones. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, SEX WISH will show you very, very badly.
