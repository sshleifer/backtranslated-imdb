If there is a film that is the worst this year - it's TASHAN. The first promo gave an indication that the film will be a boring Dhoom 2 style movie, and I knew well only before that it would be a bad movie being a Yashraj movie Or maybe seeing the cheese promo But this movie shocked me, it was even worse than Dhoom 2 and what I expected The first introduction of Saif that is boring Then Saif-Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor oh god, what's he doing in such a strange movie? What kind of role is it? What is acting doing? His first scene is fine, but then his act repeats itself and he exaggerates. Then came Akshay who provided beautiful scenes, but then the film became more boring and with all the outdated childhood stuff, overdose of Rajnikant style action scenes and all boring scenes. The ending is another joke <br /> <br /> Vijay Krishna Acharya would have had 3 more movies to direct, if this movie worked, this is the yashraj strategy, only money nothing else So Vijay is another addition to their list of The music (Vishal Shekhar) is ordinary <br /> <br /> The interpretations Akshay Kumar arrives in the film as a breath of fresh air, in reality it provides some engaging moments Saif Ali Khan is irritating, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams shockingly and ruin the show even more The rest is fine
