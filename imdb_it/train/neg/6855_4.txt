Why can't a woman be a strong character in a film without sleeping with the protagonist? The campaign manager in this film dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all he can think of. So why did he have to have a relationship with him? He added nothing to the plot and only served to demean successful women. The only value of that tidbit was the cute scene "we all went to bed with your husband". <br /> <br /> Also, haven't the people who made this film seen the national conventions that were spoofing? The broadcasting between the two main political conventions served only to underline their total ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
