this film was definitely the worst movie I've seen in my life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I didn't like the way this movie was shot. all the actors are unknown and it seems that a group of friends got together and decided to film their own movie. but it's absolutely horrible. I've never seen a worse movie the story is so fake, and I just found out that it really took a long time to get to the end of the movie. there was no plot, it seemed that it was not planned before shooting began. the story is too strange. I didn't like the slow way to get to the point of the movie. it didn't make sense to even shoot this movie. if you're considering watching this movie, don't do it. you're just wasting your time.
