Usually, any movie with Sylvester Stallone usually sucks his ass. Rambo: First Blood Part II was no exception to this. The only movies that Sylvester Stallone was good at were Rocky and First Blood. This film is extremely unrealistic and boring. It has action, but a not very good action. I didn't like watching it and would never look at it again. No wonder why he won the Razzie award for the worst movie. I would give a 3/10, the only reason it was 3 was because it had a good result, but not good enough.
