Friend, really !!!! where have you been for the last 20 years, this is shocking in every way, horror? This is a joke, there is nothing wrong with being low budget, but this is a laugh, If you want to watch the classics, Freaks by Tod Browning, the victims of Dracula and Frankenstein, the Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener's The Golem and the passengers of The Ghost Train, you can't compare it, they give it a bad name, bad acting, bad script, etc. Total life of money and free time, they have seen many movies, they were like the horror my all-time favorite, they are really speechless, I have nothing else to say that please do not make the effort to look at something so stupid, please understand
