This story of swords and spells of a terribly brutal and callous "hero" who defeats an evil king is useless in almost every detail. Acting is horrible from roles to secondary roles. The excruciating and gloating joy with which the director shows the hero smearing the blood is absolutely disgusting; nor is he redeemed of any justice for his cause, for he is as evil as the people he is fighting. The editing of the film Z is abundant, including a scene in which a character "dies" from a thrust of the sword which he obviously did not see completely! <br /> <br /> The film is clearly focusing on the charm of the female vocals, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who mostly paraded naked throughout the film. As a 20 year old man, I will not pretend that the female flesh on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and without joy, that I couldn't even enjoy this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the cheese films of this era are at least somehow redeemed with a light and ironic touch (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself quite seriously as a fantasy heroic. There's no way! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 1/2 on ****.
