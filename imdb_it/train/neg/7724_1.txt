Seeing all the negative reviews for this film, I thought it could be yet another comic masterpiece that was absolutely not meant to be. I watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered terribly by Lungren and all the other eastern cast actors, and I found the film so terrible that it was fun. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot disintegrates, the writers start drinking and the film wears out and becomes the worst EVER action movie. <br /> <br /> Lungren beats his previous efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all of Van Damme's films, Seagal's films and Stallone's non-rock films, for this distinguished honor. This film has the absolute worst acting (controls the face of Tia Carrere when she is in a scene with Dolph, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment on the little Dolph is the worst line ever in a movie), and the worst dress in a movie (Dolph in complete Japanese clothing). Picture "Tango and Cash" with worse acting, meets "Commando", meets "Friday 13" (due to senseless nudity and Lungren's performance is very similar to Jason Voorhees), in an hour and fifteen minutes of joke of a movie. br /> <br /> The good (and not terrible) performances go to the villain (who still seems constipated throughout his performance) and Carrere (who somehow says his 5 lines without bursting out laughing). Brandon Lee is there just to be Lungren's companion and do a really terrible job. <br /> <br /> A horrible and terrible film. Fear it and avoid it. If you look at it, ask yourself why underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. Speaking of underwater shots, take a look at the lame aquatic fight scene with the worst final fighting scene ever. This film has all the versions of a bad fight scene for those with little attention and to fill flashes of nudity. <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
