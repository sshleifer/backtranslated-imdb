I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything shoddy and ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit that I went to the local rental shop and found Vampires against Zombies. The name is too funny, you know that nobody in the world could pull something like this out, it just has to be bad. <br /> <br /> And boy, is BAD. After watching this horror movie, I was literally speechless. My friend and I sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, we were both thinking about the future of our life after seeing this movie. I broke the depressing silence with the words "... friend ... What?" Yes, I am a compelling individual. <br /> <br /> Here is a quick "street review" The Plot; There is nobody, ever, constantly, in "WTF" mode. Characters; No development, forgettable. The music; Worse than porn. Vampires; Their vampires? The zombies; The Zombies? <br /> <br /> In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, it's so bad I want to see it again. So do yourself a favor, look at it and become depressed.
