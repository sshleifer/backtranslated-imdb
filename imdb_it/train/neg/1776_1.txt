This film has its share of negative comments and I must agree with those who consider it one of the worst films ever made. True, most movies based on King's works are pretty bad, but this goes beyond evil in the realm of horrible. There isn't a scary moment in it unless you consider scary stupidity. It's the typical garbage of the king - twisted myths that made no sense in the first place, mixed with the so-called obvious and tormented "fears" that are as shocking as the PeeWee Playhouse (which, at least, is fun). It is full of ridiculous moments, not least the character of Alice Krige. When she goes on a rampage and starts shit like the bad guy in an old Batman TV show, it's so absurd to be disgusting. All the people who have had cameos in this (including John Landis) are lucky that they still have careers. But the most absurd part must be the cat costumes towards the end, which look like cheap rubber clothes that someone bought at K-Mart. The best part of the film is the appearance of some real cats that actually stage people in the film.
