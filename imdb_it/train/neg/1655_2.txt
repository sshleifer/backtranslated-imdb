This film really shows his age. The print I saw was terrible because of age, but it's possible that there are better prints out there. However, this was not the main problem of the film. The problem was that, although the film was made in 1933, it was essentially a silent film with only the smallest scattered dialect (just a few sentences) in the film in the most amateur way. Sometimes the backs of the characters were turned or they were talking with their hands on their faces - all in a pathetic attempt to obscure their lips and "cleaverly" (?) Hide the fact that the film was nicknamed. Well, it's true that this Czech movie should have been nicknamed in many languages, but doing it that way was really stupid and obvious. It seemed inexpensive. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film looked like a low and silly budget. It's really a shame, though, because there was a bit of a good story - a young woman who marries an older man who is gay and / or has no interest in women. But in the 21st century, few people would really be willing to sit in this archaic mess. ALSO with some glimpses of the naked (and rather large) Hedy Lamarr, it is not worth the hype that accompanied the film when it debuted. Even by 1933 standards, this film was a poorly done disaster. The only interesting thing about the film is seeing how Lamarr looked different in 1933 compared to the glamorous image that Hollywood created when it arrived in America - it looks like 2 completely different people. <br /> <br /> It's such an incomplete and technically inferior film, I don't see how it got such enthusiastic reviews. Due to technical problems, the film cannot classify a 10 or something close.
