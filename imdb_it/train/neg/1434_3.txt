James Bond in the desert? Well, this is the way it appears: Pierce Brosnan is ultimately better known as Bond in "Tommorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shot before this release. Honestly, the two protagonists of the film are both very uncomfortable, with Brosnan turning into a slightly more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau (like Pony's love interest, Gray Owl) who has to fight with careless dialogue. <br /> <br /> The two aunts, on the other hand, are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. These are the wild lands of Canadian nature. And while photography can be nice, there is no grit for the harsh reality of living in the wilds. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, unfortunately can't be convincing, because I really wanted to believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced 20-year-old in this film, and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough was perhaps not hard enough with her. It makes her look vulnerable, which of course is .. but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is certain, she looks perfect for the whole picture. But the mascara and eyebrow thickener in the desert? It's not suitable, especially since she just seems to have ever walked in the woods with Bond (I'm sorry, Gray Owl), and she uses photo photos to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I have lived with forest people in the Pacific Northwest, and it just doesn't look so pretty and stays so sweet while fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point: the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set: the 1930s. I blamed it here largely on an inelegant script that is passionate about preaching at the expense of the dramatic arc, plot points and those little details that can evoke the period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script and his latest offer, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age" was inaugurated three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. <br /> <br /> Yes, I have read the comments that others have posted, but I am not convinced A lot of potential, but poorly managed and perhaps even ill-conceived. If he had had a religious film, he would have been cut off, but since he preaches environmentalism, the film remains somewhat above criticism, since it is "politically correct". Sorry for all this, I don't buy it. Amen.
