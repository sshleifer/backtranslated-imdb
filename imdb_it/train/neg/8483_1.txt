Normally I only write reviews for movies I hate or that I really like. And, as you can probably tell by the number of stars up there, I didn't like it. At this point, I assume you've read about the plot or maybe seen the movie, so I'll skip the summary. Let's pause, pros and cons: <br /> <br /> Cons: The concept: the premise was created to be interesting. Chaos theory as a theme was interesting. However, it was not performed so well. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that the Chaos theory was somehow misrepresented. The event that happened in the film seemed more like an invented coincidence than anything else. I imagine that the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole "God (i) cause to the Tsunami to bring back the statue". The presentation looks like it's really sloppy. Some people call it smart, but it seems to be another made-up action movie. <br /> <br /> Storyline: Is it just me, or does it seem that Kamal has thrown this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles? The plot is extremely artificial; Govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure incidents (his friend happens to mix the vial with a package he was sending to India, an old madwoman happens to throw the vial into an idol, half of the cast happens only unexpectedly do they meet in the same hospital, and the case with the idol has just ended up confused with one belonging to a famous singer.) CGI: Oh god, the CGI. It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3, and those sucked. Immediately, I could say which parts were animated. Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that. <br /> <br /> Stunts: Yes, now that the action scenes in the Tamil movies are not realistic, but the stunts in this have been horrible and actually distracted me from the story. <br /> <br /> up: I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought Kamal would play people with similar skin tones, so the two fake white boys and the fake Japanese Aikido caught me off guard. However, it was still pretty ugly, I could easily tell which masks were worn. <br /> <br /> The songs: music has been distracting and out of place in many cases. <br /> <br /> Asin: His character was perhaps the most annoying of the film. She was noisy, irritated and irrationally obsessed with that idol. I really found myself wishing he would die. <br /> <br /> Hole and Logic of the refrigerator: let me know right away: a laboratory monkey was smart enough to pass a password-locked door, but not smart enough to tell the difference between a chocolate bar and a vial a deadly virus in it. And then, a former CIA agent who is looking for the phial, left for India. Instead of following him immediately, he marries a dancer first. A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks in a small third world hospital when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available. He is also shot in the throat with a bullet. You would think he would be killed, but instead the magic bullet cleaned his tumor. You read that right, a BULLET knocked out the tumor. <br /> <br /> Pro ... The Naidu Character: Perhaps the only pleasant part of the film was his comedy.
