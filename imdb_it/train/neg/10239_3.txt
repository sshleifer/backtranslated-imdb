Jude Law gives his best in this beautifully filmed vampire movie that offers little else value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement or driving women with appeal. A decent fight, some moments of slight suspense. And a plot of a single note. <br /> <br /> The film becomes philosophical in a series of conversations between the character of Law and a bitter homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are placed at the center of the film's banality. <br /> <br /> With a minor actor in the lead role - and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography - the crocodiles blend the low-budget sea of ​​low-cost vampires.
