Moreover one of the worst films ever made. The plot goes as follows. Enter the jungle in search of areas for about 10 minutes. Make Bo go somewhere and undress. Enter the jungle a little longer. Give Bo another excuse to undress you. Back to the jungle. Oh look! There's a boy looking for Tarzan! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill the safari people. The tarzan-looking guy has a fight scene. Save Bo. Bo strips. Perform credits. Run the credits, run.
