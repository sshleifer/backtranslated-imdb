So where are the cannibals? Those intrigued by the title and the "real cannibal" charm of this film will be disappointed. Instead, we are shown a strange man and his re-visit to a village in Papua New Guinea full of natives, one of whom was his lover several decades earlier. The man, Tobias Schneebaum, is a Jew from New York as they come and somehow, this is intertwined with the documentary as he appears in his yamika in different scenes. <br /> <br /> There are no real cannibals here: only stories told by some of the natives and by Tobias himself. Not all together a bad movie. Very interesting and great cinema. Schneebaum remains very sympathetic in everything and offers us a fascinating look at a life that is as far from Western civilization as can be achieved. <br /> <br /> It's not really what he claims to be on the cover and in the plot summary. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10, children.
