I read somewhere that Hollywood should focus on rebuilding bad movies and leave the classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake was not a total waste, I would still like to have the six dollars back to go to a DVD of the original. A lot of violence and one of the worst endings I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. Just the reason why Hollywood should leave good things alone.
