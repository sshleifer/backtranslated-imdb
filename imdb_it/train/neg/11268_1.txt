I was hoping that this movie would have been at least watchable. The plot was weak to say the least. I was expecting much more considering the cast line-up (I wonder if any of these will include this in their CVs?). At least I didn't pay to rent it. The best part of the film is surely Dani Behr, but the rest of the film is complete and complete.
