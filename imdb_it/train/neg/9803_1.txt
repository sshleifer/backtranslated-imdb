Power rangers are definitely the worst television show and a line of plastic toys that are completely ridiculous in US history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing even remotely fun on this completely horrible TV show. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with horrible actors, who dress in multicolored clothes with spandex that seem completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redemption value for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Today's kids should try to watch better shows like Toy Story movies instead of this junk.
