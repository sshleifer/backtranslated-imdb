The intention of director Warren Beatty to transform the famous cartoon of Chester Gould into a live cartoon (with Beatty's cast in the head as a detective at the top of his voice) has had sweet inventions of innocent nostalgia - quite unusual and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty . Unfortunately, the photo is ham requirement, fun for a while but eventually tiring. Dick Tracy attempts to bring down the Big Boy gangster Caprice, aided by the loving Tess Trueheart, but stumbled into the evil breathless Mahoney. For the first half hour or so, the Oscar-winning art direction and set design are wonderful to absorb but, while the plot creaks predictably (without a real puncture in writing), things start to get congested. Al Pacino gets a surprise Candidate for the Oscar nomination as a bad Caprice, and Madonna (which is mainly used as a decorative object) sings "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)" by Stephen Sondheim, who won the Best Award original Song. Much heart, thanks to Beatty - who dedicated himself to his vision - but the image is too beautiful and calculated. Lacks heat. * 1/2 from ****
