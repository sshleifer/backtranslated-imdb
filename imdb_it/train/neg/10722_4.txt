** SPOILER *** Slow as a film of treacle mummy involving this atonement in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt which must be aborted to keep the indigenous population, which at that time turned against British rule, to find out. <br /> <br /> Given the task of arriving at this archaeological excavation by his superiors Capt. Storm, Mark Dana, along with a couple of British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin, Diane Brewster, the chief's excavation wife Robert Quentin, George N. Neise, heads for her missing mother's grave. During the journey Capt. Storm Sylvia and his men come across this desert-like princess, Simira, Ziva Rodann. <br /> <br /> Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life, she doesn't drink water or get tired, but she also knows what Capitan Storm & Co. is looking for and warns him and the his group to stay as far away as possible from the excavation, the tomb of Ra Ha Tet of the pharaoh. <br /> <At the burial chamber of Ra Ha Tet Robert Quentin and his crew of archaeologists along with Simera's brother, Simira's brother, Numaro, Alvaro Guillot, has already opened his tomb before Capt. Storm can get there to stop them. Quentin violated the body of Ra Ha Tet by having the bandages cut off by Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott. This action for the part of Robert and Dr. Farrady has the upper hand over Numar. Later it appears that Numar was in some way possessed by the spirit or soul of Ra Ha Tet who took over his body and made him age, at the rate of 500 years an hour, to become himself a 3,000-year-old mummy . <br /> <br /> The film has Numar dressed in what looks like pajamas that creeps around the tomb of Ra Ha Tet and that is attracting the environment and sucking blood to survive, like a vampire, any man or animal that comes into contact with this blood-sucking adventure of Numar, with him who later loses his right arm, goes on for a while until the now crazy Quentin tries to find the entrance, in fact you thought that he has already found it, at the tomb of Ra Ha Tet himself killed is an indoor slide. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film we learn that Numar, without any surprise, is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated in another, about 3,000 years later, person or life. Numar's sister, the mysterious and sexy Simira, is not only Ra Ha Tet's sister, since he and Numar are really the same person, but also the Egyptian goddess Cat Babesti! It is also not difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> With Numar / Ra Ha Tet in his grave and all the deaths, due to the Curse of the Pharaoh, now at the end Capt. Storm Sylvia and all that is left of his men and the archaeological expedition of the late Robert Quentin returned to Cairo and modern civilization, this in 1902. The survivors of Pharaoh Ra Ha Tet Curse keep what they found, and unearthed, only for themselves since no one would have believed them anyway.
