The most misogynistic film of all time? Not to mention '68 shouldn't have gone beyond whites with brown faces to play "Indians"? My favorite parts must be when the girls giggle and blush as the bikers drag them out to rape them. Rape is fun! Who knew? Let's see, then there are the obvious scams of "The Hustler" (the fat character actually plays billiards while trying to destroy the Indians with the main rebel dude), the horrible acting, the so-on-nose-them-cues of music that might just tell you what you think, the lack of ANYONE IS REALLY Indian in this movie. And for whom should we be rooting? I have to say that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to support strong women, I have heard from at least one source that in real life he is a misogynistic idiot. Why did I look at it, ask? Do not ask
