Summer Phoenix is ​​very effective as a young inarticulate woman, imprisoned within herself, but never convincing as a theatrical actress of growing fame who wins and earns from this detachment. Even in the long scenes of Esther's acting lessons, we never see her perform the teacher's instructions. After suffering from Esther's pain (largely self-inflicted) in heartbreaking details, we are not given any persuasive sense of his triumph. <br /> <br /> The obsessive presence of heroin's pain seems to be understood as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence.

Esther Kahn is not yet ready to go before an audience.
