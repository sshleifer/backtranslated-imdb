Lots of story holes in the movie. First we see that he observes his master practicing kung-fu and dies in the middle of his practice. That's fine with me. And then at the end of the film, we see him using kung-fu he learned only by looking at his master when he was still a kid. It's possible? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> This show is reserved for Jay Chou fans, and the film lacks depth in terms of character development, film styles and plot development. <br /> <br /> Does anyone notice that the captain of the basketball team (he forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao seem so similar to each other, to the point that you would think they were the same person? Long hair, solar boy's look, tall and strong. They both seemed to come from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that make teenage girls scream wildly. Not that those two actors had anything worthwhile to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry. <br /> <br /> The jokes were lame and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> The scene regarding the 4 masters of Jay Chou who come back to help him on the basketball court, degenerated into a useless plot when they began to hit opponents with Royal Rumble style. Worse, when the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd started cheering, and the game continued. Was it really a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the game, all thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. The way he acquired those kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills only by observing his master. <br /> <br /> And then his missing father comes out of the carpentry shop to recognize Jay Chou as his missing son seemed a little too quick of the director to finish the film. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual "chick flick"). Just watch it if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide a lot with those from the list of the 250 best IMDb movies of all time, then this movie is not for you.
