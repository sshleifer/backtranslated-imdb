The worst movie ever made !!! Please see the reviews of real films of the professionals of this film. Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this movie. The comments made on this site are apparently from people with some financial interest in this film. I find the positive comments very misleading. I find it incredible how negative comments are so negative against this film and the positive comments sound like an Academy Awards speech. Don't waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is delayed !! I can't believe a film like this would ever be made. Why should Hollywood waste their time with this stuff? This film is an attempt at nothing. I wonder what more loose could actually sink their money by producing that garbage. I went to the blockbuster and the clerk also told us not to waste time and money. I didn't listen and lost time and money. Please don't make the same mistake! It's really the "worst movie ever made!"
