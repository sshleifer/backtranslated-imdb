Like watching home movies from nearby summer camps, "Indian Summer" is a bore that arouses sleep. Eight campers are just introduced, when incredibly boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally wasted on this movie. The observation of a camper that "everything seems much smaller than I remember" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. Early jokes are neither funny nor original, unless you think that the short tarpaulin is a real "screamer". This film was a great disappointment considering the wide talent involved. "Indian Summer" didn't make me suffer from nostalgia, just sick. - MERK
