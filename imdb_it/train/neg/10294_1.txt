Nothing is happening. <br /> <br /> So characters without personalities don't develop. <br /> <br /> So the end never comes because there is no beginning or center. <br /> <br /> There are some beautiful shots that are not beautiful because they are not even allowed to be, because this film is not even there. There is no "is" in this film because there is no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialogue or point. There is nothing! <br /> <br /> There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the real movie is such that watching it is not even worth your time, so if you're really interested, I'd suggest you go and buy the soundtrack or something. You will have everything you can from this movie without fatigue, headache and impatience. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
