Sorry. Someone has to say it. This is really / was a boring movie. Worthy perhaps, but still boring. I almost cried with boredom when I looked at him. The acting is pretty terrible, the drawn and predictable plot, the score and the work with the camera are absolutely standard and not very exciting. It is one of those films that are not allowed to hate (because they are disabled people), but I hate it. I suspect almost everyone does it. It is interesting that the critics have been so kind to this film. I suppose that they too are not allowed to be objective. This was done to win prizes - which I remember duly did. But it was neither interesting nor fun. I haven't seen the game so I can't compare.
