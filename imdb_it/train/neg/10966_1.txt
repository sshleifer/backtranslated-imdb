A friend once told me that an independent film of an art house ran into a movie theater when - at the end of the film - the audience was so furious that they preceded to snatch the seats of the cinema. Of course, my imagination was unleashed, trying to evoke the content of such a work. Well, now my imagination can be put to rest. <br /> <br /> I've been a lifelong fan of Andrei Tarkovky and an ardent admirer of his work. I came across many people who thought that Tarkovsky's films were slow and inert. Opinions are what they are, I found that this is not true of the director's wonderful works, which were created with meaning, beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions. After listening to Aleksandr Sokurov, Tarkovsky's heir, I was excited to try his films. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the open-air journey through the fields (Stalker), this film has no affinity with anything made by Tarkovsky. It does not seem to have the slightest meaning, even on a completely mindless level. Apparently "luxurious" cinematography lacks any compositional art. There is no balance, no proportion, and the exposure counter seems to be running out on batteries in frozen snow. The main character is so inept and undecided, it makes you wonder if his father could have been alive if he had made a decision earlier. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, I am not opposed to non-plot or plot that progress on multiple non-linear modes. But there is not even a non-story here. One must surely enter the vision of this film with a shaved head if one were to come out of it with nothing gained and nothing lost, as pulling one's hair would be the only possible answer at a pace that could make a sculpture of the time of Tarkosky seem like Jerry Bruckheimer shot a short film by Charlie Chaplin. <br /> <br /> I do not exclude that this may be one of Sokurov's stinkers (Tarkovskij's Solaris), but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky's heirs on this film - It would be to call Aristotle's successor Paris Hilton. Come on guys, don't be afraid to say it. No amount of grandiose words is about to magically bring this celluloid corpse back to life. I do not profess to fully understand Russian culture and probably have no Russian values, but I immediately grasped something magical, a treasure and a gift for the spectators on Tarkovskij's work. <br /> <br /> did not have the name of Sokurov, and aired on Saturday Night Live, I'm pretty sure no one would "read" all these magnificent analyzes in this wet film of a movie.
