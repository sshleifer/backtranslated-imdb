When Marlene Dietrich was labeled a box office poisoner in 1938, one of the few actresses so nominated by commercial newspapers, they were films like The Garden of Allah. How a movie can be so incredibly beautiful that it looks and being so boring is beyond me. Even as Marlene, if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot, she was stuck with such an outdated story. <br /> <br /> The Garden Of Allah, one of the very first modern technicolor films, was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens, who then collaborated on a stage adaptation with Mary Anderson who played for 241 performances in 1911-12. He therefore obtained two adaptations of the silent screen. The story is about a monk who flees the monastery in French Tunisia to see what he has lost in the world. He runs into an equally protected woman who was not married and spent his early years caring for a sick parent. Now he travels in the desert and the two meet on a train. <br /> <br /> The woman is obviously Marlene and the escaped monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what's in David O. Selznick's mind when filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman could have made it appealing to the public. But you can bet on the audience coming out in 1936, when they shelled out their money for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet it was a bit of romance in the desert and the seduction they expected. <br /> <br /> As for the monks, you must remember that they are self-sufficient in their monasteries and this particular one bottles up a special wine that Boyer seems to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink its economy if Boyer leaves. The monks are a genuinely devoted group, but from the head Charles Waldron they basically have a right to be a little worried about some personal interest. <br /> <br /> However, a lot of religious platitudes are said here by a couple of cables that are not suitable for the parts. Especially Marlene Dietrich. I'd watch this movie with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and I'll forget the plot.
