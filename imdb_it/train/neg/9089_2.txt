The film has only one flaw, unfortunately this flaw damages all the credibility of the piece. <br /> <br /> It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of the disputed territories. He can't face the reason why the Israelis are there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. This is why Israel "occupies" their land, because those countries lost it in a war that they started. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel challenged the UN by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is 242 was rejected immediately after it began by ..... the Palestinians, making it null. <br /> <br /> Many movies are put together well, and can really show footage that changes minds, but remember, when you look at something, I don't believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All the participants in this film are known critics of Israel, and some have made many public anti-Semitic comments, eliminating any possible credibility to their words. <br /> <br /> All participants are in desperate need of a true history lesson taught objectively, not by some Palestinian sympathizer.
