The proverb "Never judge a book by its cover" has been coined as a warning to those who cannot look beneath the surface. <br /> <br /> As I saw the artwork in "King of the Ants" I immediately thought HORROR! The arcane images proudly shown on the cover and on the back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal and punishment. Instead what I discovered under that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. <br /> <br /> "King of the Ants" presents Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did I feel compassion or understanding for this character. In fact it is definitely unlikely, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews) who turns into an uninspired performance as rendered the worst by the absolutely ridiculous dialogue that he is forced to perform. He casts Kari Wuhrer like a grieving widow who apparently has an unconditional trust (especially in the homeless) and little or no common sense, and George Wendt in the role of the Duke, who is basically a sober Norm from Cheers but MEAN! <br /> <br /> Now there are a couple of interesting "hallucination" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images), but this film does not delve further into the world. He prefers to bombard you with unmotivated characters, wrong dialogues and unlikely events after an unlikely event. Oh the horror!
