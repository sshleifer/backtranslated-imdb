I was attracted to this film when I looked at the cast list, but after seeing it I have to admit that I felt a little disappointed. The main problem with this film is that the actors are unable to keep this film on their shoulders. Why? Because of the bad script. Even if Dillon, Lane and Jones try hard to take this film to another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. So for Matt Dillon fans this is a watchable movie, just like admirers of the beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but it's not a movie for him; far below its level. So if you are connected by this great cast look at it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. The only thing you will remember about this film is the scenes of Diane Lane; the rest is very forgettable.
