Ok, so I understand. We should be horrified. The idea was planted. A girl is doing her dad and is taking pictures of it. Call me for the shock-rock genre but I ask for the explicit detail of an act before it can fall for it. But don't expect me to watch a soft-porn and be terrified that she's "making her father" ... I mean, it's not like the convention was a bit abused in the adult movie industry already infiltrated "rape and harassment" 'porn ... Horror is not what your mind can deceive in believing. It is what really exists in the film. This is where Miike fails in visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choice for one's adventure.
