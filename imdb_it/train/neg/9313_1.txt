This was by far the worst low-budget horror movie I've ever seen. I am an open minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when I'm renting a movie, I'm looking for some good underrated horror movies. They are always good at laughing, they think they know, I have seen many. But this film was so terrible that it wasn't worth a laugh. I was thinking of turning it off in the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There is nothing good about it in the first place, the television crew suck3d A $$. The introduction was as stupid as the ending. The acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, DO NOT watch this movie, it will absolutely hate it.
