Ok, if you've seen The Ring, you've pretty much seen The Grudge. He's trying to be scary just by having a crazy photo job and loud sounds, but he fails miserably. The plot, if one can say so, is weak and rather full of potholes, for example, how could the treatment center that Yoko didn't show up at work know when the people who lived in that house were not there? And it's not very clear what Bill Pullman's character has to do. He simply came out of nowhere to advance the plot. It didn't make much sense what happened to the original family. Who was hanging in the room, the boy or the dad? And was Yoko dead or alive when the treatment center guy found her? There were too many unanswered questions and I was too bored to think about it more.
