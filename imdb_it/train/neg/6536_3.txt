This DVD seems to be intended for someone who will wear it and play it in an infinite loop in the background. It is organized as a series of Grand Canyon music videos set on various pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, TD music is boring and DVD transfer seems rather blurry and weak. A DVD too expensive for what it is.
