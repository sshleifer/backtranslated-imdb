When evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra-right and conservative groups like this in the United States, you need to consider the following. The United States of America with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights which has its flaws and disadvantages. It is of course expected that far-right groups and ultra-conservative groups exist in considerable numbers, yet relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated. On a per capita basis, Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right-wing groups, actually on a cap-based basis, the actual size of the neo-Nazi groups in Australia are actually higher than in the United States of America . It is for the reasons set out above that it is unjustifiable to belittle and defame the American people and its level of debate in educated American society by presenting this group of far-right psychopaths as a representative of American society in a very fraudulent and deceptive manner. In doing so, Greenstreet deliberately chose small, isolated groups on opposite ends of the spectrum to build an image of America that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film is clearly designed to inflame and support the opinions of those who nurture this subconscious and morbid hatred of the American people and their lifestyle under the guise of a fashionable idealistic leftist ideology and spurious clich√©s. This film was made for profit, not to promote the truth about American society and the human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries centered on far-right conspiracies, the military industrial complex, but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate, as well as alternative solutions to the failures of a vibrant democracy. Movie Show is exposed as anti-American by its support for this junk. SENSATIONALISM to its worst shameful anti-US refusal.
