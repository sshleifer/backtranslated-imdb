Faith Domergue (better known as "Dr. Ruth" in THIS ISLAND EARTH) is the only reason to watch this movie. The story is very subtle and once the Air Force comrades return to the United States with a Damn Cobra on them the action is just a waiting game. See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend that the rest is not happening.
