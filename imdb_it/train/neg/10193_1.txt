With this film, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the power of the film, clearly stating in the film that his work is "objectivity". Obviously, it is not. For a reason, many 'shot by accident' scenes are obvious set ups (when that poor goat 'accidentally' falls off the cliff, you can actually see the gun smoke on the right of the screen!). For another, his concealment of important information: the people of Hurdes were like that for a specific reason that is barely mentioned in the film. That is, goiter, a disease caused by the lack of iodine (salt). This goiter is the cause of their cretinism and Bunuel took only the time to do his research (heck, if he had checked "cretinism" in a medical dictionary he would have found "gozzo"), MAY have ended up telling the truth about these people (still, doubtfully). Instead, with his film, he constantly judges them, speaking of them as "idiots", over and over again, dramatizing the action, creating scenes to create the show, all this absolutely unacceptable for a documentary filmmaker who claims to work for objectivity Almighty. Bunuel talks all the time in this film, without leaving a word to the people he is filming. Speak for them and even then, judge them. This piece is imperfect due to its roots, its ideology and it is a real pity that it is considered a great film.
