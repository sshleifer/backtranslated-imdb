"A Guy Thing" tries to capture the feeling of "There's Something About Mary" or "Meet the Parents", but it comes out more as if it had been modified by scraps from these two films. Luckily I rented it in a 5 day rental because I couldn't sit and watch more than 20 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The premise is decent and I liked the scenes where other guys automatically hide Paul's missteps (the Save-Mart chessboard was great) but the script is absolutely horrible. The dialogue is interrupted most of the time and just when you think things are finally going on track, some useless visual gags are blocked without a good reason. Also how many jokes about the bathroom really need a movie? <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, the slapstick humor is fantastic when it is done elegantly like in the other films I mentioned, but this film simply lacks the brand. Too bad I love Julia Stiles (Ten things I hate about you was fantastic) but even that couldn't help me sit in this terrible movie. Save your dollars and go rent "There's something for Mary" once again.
