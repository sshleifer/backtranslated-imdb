Normally I have no problem getting away from a bad movie, but this was a unique case. This movie was so ugly that I actually sat around the whole thing almost praying that it would have a minute of a good movie to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Located in a beach house where a group of college friends celebrate holidays, this film suffers from numerous problems that make it not worthy of being seen. First of all, there are holes in the plot. Secondly, very few C-lists (I would not even call them B), actors can act in a harmful way, so all the scenes that have a potential failure miserably. Thirdly, the rhythm of the film is very rough and complicated to watch most of the time making it very difficult to build suspense, leading to very few surprises for the public. Fourth and, above all, the ending is completely anti-climatic partly due to how it ends (setting / who turns out to be the murderer) and partly because the dialogue is simply atrocious. To the credit of the film, it's the only film I'll ever say is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen many. <br /> <br /> So, just like a bad joke, you'd have been all the happiest of never having heard, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you'll have to scream no, you really don't. while running in the opposite direction.
