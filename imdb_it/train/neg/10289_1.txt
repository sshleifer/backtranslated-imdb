This should deserve an "O" score, or even a negative ten. I watched this show for years, and the show blew up the shark around the 7th series. This episode, however, is proof that the show blew up the shark. The writing is lazy, absurd, self-indulgent and not even worthy of junk like Beavis and Butthead. <br /> <br /> It is quite possible to be ridiculous and still have fun - Pirates of the Caribbean, the Mummy, Count of Montecristo - all "funny" films not to be taken seriously. However, there is something ridiculous as in "this is the worst thing I've ever seen". And indeed, this is the worst Stargate episode I've ever seen. It's absolutely terrible, and this comes from someone with a stargate in his basement. <br /> <br /> It makes me want to sell all my stuck supports, more seriously.
