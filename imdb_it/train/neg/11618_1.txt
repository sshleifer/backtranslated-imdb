The acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the film is so slow and boring, as soon as it becomes interesting, everything slows down considerably. I'm glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, as did the other actors like I said but the man ... this is one of the worst drag movies I've ever seen. Now maybe in a short film this movie would be nice, but other than that, avoid it. This film has so much filler that it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /> <br /> I never go out, ever, in the movies, but looking at this at home with the family, I left. Yes, it was boring. Apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to publish, so here's a bit more filling. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just saw.
