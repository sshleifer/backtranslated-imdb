Awlright, damn it, the MooCow will grudgingly admit the truth: I kind of like this cheap and poor parody of the 70s. The idea that vast hordes of murderous tomatoes are destroying the United States is a great idea and, despite everything, the moovie gives some decent giggles, with the sight of terrified accomplices fleeing big obviously fake tomatoes. This film, along with The Kentucky Fried Moovie, is one of the first attempts at parody, which became so popular in the 80s and 90s, thanks mainly to the airplane! This, like the bad parody, is rather poor. Many attempts at humor are sad failures and lead to many groans. But thanks to the ravenous hordes of tomatoes, the hateful song "Puberty Love" and the impressive scene of a helicopter crash, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes provides some goods, albeit largely for the wrong reasons. There are so many things wrong with this movie ... and so right, it's hard to explain. It took enough people because the Tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore movies and a cartoon series !! Big chunks of time spent away from tomatoes are rather boring. And dig the clothes of the 70s, friend !! ; = 8) This tomato is shabby and cheese, but it's worth a laugh or two; the MooCow says to take a pizza and make a pop in the Tomatoes !! : ??
