Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent films. And, I like low budget B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I also like bad recitations, arranged scripts, wooden lines, unlikely situations and the like. However, I didn't like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work on so many levels. For all the reasons listed above and many others. This includes the senseless and brazen use of images of female genitalia. And the many allusions to the male genitals, in a very Freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely ineptitude. Unlike some attempt to do something really different. I mean, any film that takes years to shoot cannot maintain the level of congruity and attention required by the modern public. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that the whole movie was just a dream or a hallucination of the main character. However, unfortunately, it was thought to have happened, as we have seen things take place on the screen. <br /> <br /> About the only kindness I can express, is that the image in the end was wonderful. If this had been used at the beginning, instead of the end, it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended ... They didn't try. I simply don't understand what was so important in this film that it had to be made. Was it the plot? Surely, it could not be. Were they the characters? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing Ed 15. Was it dialogue? Emphatically, no. The music? Perhaps, but more likely the unpainted ego of the principles that must be caressed. <br /> <br /> Many better efforts died out on the assembly room floor.
