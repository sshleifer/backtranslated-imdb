Nice pain, I can't even begin to describe how scarce this film is. Don't get me wrong, I didn't expect much to begin with. Let's face it, a flicker PG-13 is pre-designed to miss the ummm ... sharp, so no one should be surprised by the lack of blood. But it was the level of incompetence and clich√©s on display in all the other aspects of this film that really upset me. <br /> <br /> We have a protagonist who is simply so completely useless that you find yourself cheering on the villain. And here's a breakthrough for books ... IT HAS NEVER CHANGED - thus breaking the cardinal rule of basic screen writing - character development. If you think that at the end of this film the poor little girl will turn around and eventually give someone a kick, then she'll think again. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we are given the least intriguing (and certainly the least scary) killer I've ever paired with the genre. I'm not kidding when I say that Dora the Explorer has scarier villains than this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, because all the potential for tension or gratitude is removed by the iniquitous (and apparently thirteen year old) director, what could be left to fill up 2 hours of screen? <br /> <br /> Cabinets, that's what. <br /> <br /> Lots of wardrobes: large wardrobes, small wardrobes, mirrored wardrobes, wardrobes in Narnia, so many cursed wardrobes that you wouldn't want to dress for another year. Actually this film should have just been called "CLOSET", and had a picture of a big henchman on the DVD case. On the back he could have had a photograph of the sleeping public and a quote from Roger and Ebert - something to the extent of: "that f * @! We have lost time watching!"
