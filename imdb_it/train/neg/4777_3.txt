The idea behind this film was good. Too bad it wasn't written well. Selling Sidney Poitier as an FBI agent was a good idea and he did an exceptional job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, knows only one emotion in most of his films, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could have been a great one, and he also showed some possibilities once, but the writer disappointed us making his role above all a helpless female. This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character it should have been. I don't care that Alley plays anyway. The film should have ended about fifteen minutes before what he did. The director milked the cow before the exceptional final action. I will keep this in my collection only as an example of Poitier's performances.
