In Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s, I think every studio could do a western, except Warner Bros. The few times they try, it's always ridiculous (except, perhaps, for killing with their boots - which is a cavalry westerns.) I read that Humphrey Bogart, seeing James Cagney with this big cowboy hat on his head, said it looked like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are too urban, too XXe century to be credible in a western movie. The story here was not surprising, and it didn't help. Every 10 minutes, I imagine seeing Bogart and Cagney dropping their little guns and getting their hands on a machine gun to escape the set in a 1930s black car.
