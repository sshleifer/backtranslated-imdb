A disappointing end to a season that started so well ... <br /> <br /> Exodus part 2 and other noteworthy episodes were among the best seen on TV in any series, where this was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm not sure the episode was a disappointment, but the guitar music that accompanied the closing sequence was ridiculous and would have been more comfortable in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate executives didn't like low-down and ended up getting it jazzed up. They failed and ruined everything. <br /> <br /> We hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> At least we have seen the return of a certain person although somewhat bizarre and tritely done.
