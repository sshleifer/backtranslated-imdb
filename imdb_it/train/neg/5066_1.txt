This is the worst show. Buntch of adults who behave like children, no humor. Even Sesame Street has a better and more adult humor than the friends "Friends" could be the worst thing I've ever seen on television and I was sitting in front of the tube observing Friends "it just doesn't stack well with other, contemporary series. "Seinfeld" intelligence and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the mark of "Frasier". The characters of "Friends" seem designed to make them dullard repellents. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my skin crawl <br /> <br /> The unintelligent show is completely uneven: the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is somewhat sophisticated, even if intentionally. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to enslave to bet more below their abilities so as not to confuse the faithful friends of "Friends".)
