I loved the first movie "Azumi". I saw Ms. Ueto in a variety of her TV appearances and saw my fair share of samurai and ninja movies. I must say that this film was much weaker than I expected. <br /> <br /> Given the cast of the film and created in "Azumi", they should have been able to do a much better job with this film, but instead it was slow, struggling in parts, and sprinkled with much acting poor, unconvincing, and in wood. <br /> <br /> When they bothered to refer to the first movie, they did it in a way that was quite loose and weak. In "Azumi", the title character is the best of a group of superior killers. In "Azumi 2" it seems somewhat diminished and less impressive. <br /> <br /> This does not mean that it was a total loss. There were some decent fighting scenes and some exaggerated characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The last two really captured the "manga" in their script, while the former never "understood".
