1st watched on 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): 3-D Mindless movie on carnivorous zombies in a story of 3 in a movie chronicle. And yes, we come to see the zombies who eat parts of human flesh in 3D !! Wow, not !! This has been done over and over again in 2D in a zombie movie, but what usually makes a zombie film better is the underlying story, not the actual eating meat. This is what made the original original zombies good. The meat eating was just launched as an extra. In reality we are bored for most of this 3-part chronicle because of the easily understandable lame (type twilight-zone) and the late ending that reveals the rhythm. The last story is actually the story with which the film began (with a journalist investigating a so-called ghost town) and, of course, we will also see the meat eating zombies in that. Well, I think I've said enough. Look at the classics, not this 3D reamed party.
