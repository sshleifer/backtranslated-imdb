I haven't decided yet whether this will replace Anaconda as "The worst movie I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the evanescent accidents, the low production values ​​and the frightening camera work, this film has absolutely nothing for this. I went to see him just because I had read the book and I wanted to see how the complicated plot would work in a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> The answer is simple - they didn't. The characters appear with little or no explanation as to who they are and therefore proceed not to play a precious part in the narrative. Even the main characters act for no reason, so that when the film reaches its climax you don't care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books should be rewritten from time to time to fit films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I left the cinema, I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what should have happened. <br /> <br /> The true meaning of the title of books "Rancid Aluminum" also changes, compressing it into another piece of useless voice, just so they can allow the film to have an interesting title. <br /> <br /> A real movie mess from start to finish.
