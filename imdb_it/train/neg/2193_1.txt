A demented scientist's girlfriend is beheaded and brings her head back to life. Honestly this is the plot of the film. He will try to take another body looking for him in the most squalid area of ​​the city for that perfect body. For some reason he has an ugly monster in a closet in his cabin. The sleaze style of the film is ridiculous. No one in the film can actually behave including the head. The closet monster is a man with a bound mask and you can really tell. The plot is slow, weak and the ending is so poorly done. Check out the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this move. Believe me, people wouldn't watch this movie alone.
