With a film by Bo Derek, the audience gets what they expect. A plot of thin paper and some shots of Mrs. Derek without clothes. "Ghosts can't do that" is just that. The first fifteen minutes are normal television dramas, provided that Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He's a great actor with a long experience in many different roles, but sometimes it seems that even a famous actor has to work only for money. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing an extraordinarily beautiful young woman with or without clothes. The film is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see naked women or bad acting, rent a porn movie.
