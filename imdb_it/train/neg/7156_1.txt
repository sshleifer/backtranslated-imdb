Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Well, it certainly does after this endurance test for a movie. How the hell did I manage to continue without hitting the fast forward button, only the gentleman knows it. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's me !! Maybe I don't understand the premise of the film ... or maybe I don't appreciate its supposed mystical atmosphere. In my humble opinion, the film has a mystical atmosphere as much as a trip to McDonald's. <br /> <br /> Furthermore the characters were all terrible and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon. Yaarrrghhh! Why do I do it? why am i looking at this tripe? Just run away and join a monastery or the foreign Legion !! YAARGH !! An absolutely terrible film in almost every aspect. Apart from that, it's not bad.
