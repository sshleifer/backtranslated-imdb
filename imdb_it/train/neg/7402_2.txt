This is a typical example of technically very experienced directors of video clips / commercials trying to make their first full-length feature film. On the one hand, the images, the camera, the lighting, the CGI and even the sound are highly polished and look really "expensive". Even the actors show some potential - to the point where even the best acting cannot hide a negative plot. <br /> <br /> In this case it is not a negative plot, but almost a plot. <br /> <br /> So 50% of the dialogue consists of "What the hell was that?", "What was that?" and "What the hell was that?" In none of the cases, however, none of the characters and the public receive the slightest hint of response. In most other dialogues one has the feeling that there has never been any form of dialogue book and the actors have had to improvise freely in a plot that has never been explained to them. <br /> <br /> The only reason why the performance of Skye Bennet could be so beautiful that her character as an autistic girl did not allow her to give her these tragically horrible dialogues with which the other actors had to confront. In this way she was able to show her acting talent to which the rest of the cast could not even get close. I mean, there is not a single actor in the world who can recover a dialogue like this: <br /> <br /> Ben: Is it true, eh? Emily: stop it. Ben: a mass psychosis, eh? Jon: Someone has to take control of this situation. Ben: this situation cannot be controlled. Not from you, not from anyone. Emily: not even from your side. Ben: No <br /> <br /> It gave me goose bumps. But not for the horror, any more for the horrible attempt. In some moments I was ashamed that the actors had added this to their lives. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for excellent technical work.
