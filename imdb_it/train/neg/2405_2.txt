This film deserved a job on Mystery Science Theater. Although it has nothing to do with King Solomon, it is worth looking at because it is an unintentional laugh. Really! It's worse than "Destroy All Monsters". Be sure to check out the following: the cheese medallion (it looks like the Shriners were here), the Norfolk obviously polyester jacket on "Allan Quatermain", David MaCallum's ill-made stutter (which distracts attention from his worst acting ), the incredibly bad process works on all the "monsters", the monsters themselves - the puppet that threatens the child, the giant snake that threatens Macallum as it sinks in oatmeal, the red eyes on motorized crabs, incredibly hilarious boat (oh, brother !!) that seems to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredger and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom ("Voyage into the Future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions - (the Phoenicians invented the alphabet - come on!), and the thing worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with his frightening wig) playing smoochino face -oh the horror! The best parts are that intrepid explorers manage to lose the French comedian, and the African boy -Snuffleupagus or other - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in other scenes.
