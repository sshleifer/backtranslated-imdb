I think it can summarize this show beyond anything. Batman TAS could be the worst thing that ever happened in comic book-based cartoons, because everything that comes next will be compared to it and nothing has yet been measured. It's too damn good. Is Batman Beyond Good? "Yes, but it wasn't TAS." Is Justice League Good? "It's not bad, but it's not TAS." <br /> <br /> Even the Batman is certainly not TAS, but I will not hold it against. It would be unfair and also has many other problems with it. <br /> <br /> The concept of a younger and less experienced Batman combat crime is an excellent concept, and sometimes the art is very beautiful. But the rest of the time, art is worthless, Americanime, and this betrays many of the flaws in the show itself. He is stimulated, written and designed like an American. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan Adventures, I'd watch Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I could bang my head against the wall at any time and get the same effect. The Joker is a murderous and mentally unstable clown in a suit that uses his wits, unpredictability and smart gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to fight melee, he will either resort to something cheap or he will be totally out of fashion. It is not intended to be a dreadlocks monkey that knows kung-fu and can jump twenty feet into the air, accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do it with a villain, there were other less important characters who could have used or * panting * could have created a completely new one. And it's not that re-imaginations are a bad thing, don't get me wrong. TAS (I go there again) took Mr. Freeze from your bad bad standard B-governor and turned him into a memorable and morally complex character. Obviously Freeze wasn't exactly a bad classic at the time and they did an update, but the point remains. What The Batman does is that he takes everything you like about the Batman comics and tradition and brings a big, smelly dump on them. Guess what? They were eating corn. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this show cannot withstand TAS, but it supports it on its legs and it still does not work for me. The plots are not good and do not develop better. They were written for the demographic group of children under twelve. Should children be able to enjoy a show? Of course they should. This should not be a show for adults with oath, nudity and gratuitous violence. But the mark of a really good show is that it can be appreciated on different levels of all ages. This show misses that mark. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? No of course not. The problem is that it is not even a JLU.
