I sat at this in GenCon just because it was quiet and I could take a nap. What a waste of time. Beverly D'Angelo and William Katt? WTF? Was it the lady who played Flo and Abe Vigoda or something? <br /> <br /> Really, a piece of trash garbage. The characters were stereotyped meaningless (I think ...) and made of wood, most of them seemed to be on autopilot. The so-called "hilarious" situations described in some of the other so-called reviews were so trivial, I cried for writers. <br /> <br /> I am confused about how anyone can find what is worth their time, seriously. I'm giving him only 3 out of 10 because to be a 2 or 1, it should be five hours or more Kelly LeBrock.
