Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie would be stupid, I did honestly, I gave an incredibly low standard to satisfy. The only reason I saw it was because there were a group of girls going (different story for a different time). As I started watching I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two terrible types, there is Freddy vs Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit and laugh and joke about how terrible, and then there's a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create momentary interest for me. As I watched the first piece I was not only bored senseless, but it seemed to me that I had somehow been violated by the horror of that movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this film didn't click. One of the things that the directors / producers / writers / whatevers have changed is that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character except the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they have also refused to capture the original (and I hate to use this word, but adapt) the purity of the original. The book was like a Sunday ice cream, colorful and delicious, and the film was a bit bland and hard to swallow like sawdust. <br /> <br /> Avoid him as a leprous prostitute.
