When I saw it in a shop I thought it was really beautiful and original. Like Wolfs Creek he meets the Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only costs three pounds (about $ 6). To be honest, I don't think it was worth it. <br /> <br /> It looked like the directors - the "butchers" could not decide if they wanted to do a kind of artistic horror or a bloody horror. It ended with a clich√© guided by an hour sadistic and fifteen minutes with all the one-dimensional characters and one could not care less about what happened to them, but to try to make the public attentive to the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film, which to be honest was not necessary. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was really the medium / fine - I won't ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> In general a useless watch. It looked like a two-hour movie, but in reality it was only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic film, don't bother yourself. If you want a slasher film - don't worry - the film moves so slowly without anything ever happening.
