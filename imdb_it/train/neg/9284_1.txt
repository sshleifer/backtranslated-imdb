Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space is better than this movie. This film doesn't have enough plot for half an hour, yet they managed to extend it for an eternity of over an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, especially in those scenes of exaggerated struggle, but things like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk is much better than this sorry thing that it would be better not to miss it.
