My girlfriend chose this; As an African American born and raised in the south, I found the plot and the premise of this film totally without credibility. Believing that the racial class and prejudices would be so easily and comfortably suspended would derive only from someone totally unrelated to the southern ante-bellum. Totally absurd !!! I wonder how they had a good actor like Harvey Keitel and a good actress like Andie McDowell (who knows better than the south) to take part in this shit
