"Trigger Man" is surely the most boring and stupid film I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating. <br /> <br /> Actors seem to be recruited on uglypeople.com. They have no talent to act convincingly. <br /> <br /> They walk, walk and walk in the forest. There is more space to walk than in all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" together. After the first hour, I started reading a Porsche brochure while watching "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time and money. I would give that movie a 0 out of 10 stars, since this is not possible, I must give 1 star.
