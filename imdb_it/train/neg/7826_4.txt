Special effects? Good. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No texture No depth No meaning. This film has made Superman a meaningless hero, a hero with no archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here, he represented nothing but a Hulk. Surely, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was a good choice, among others. <br /> <br /> This still does not solve the problem that this film has no depth. I can't see how anyone could come up with anything meaningful from this movie, when Superman was, and is, created daily to be a significant hero not only in comics but also in people's minds. This was a real waste of money considering how many directions this movie could take. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism and so on and so forth. It was just another Hackman incarnation. <br /> <br /> And Superman? What did you stop for in this movie? Nothing but another figure of "savior". <br /> <br /> Wait for it to arrive at the dollar theater, if you see it at all.
