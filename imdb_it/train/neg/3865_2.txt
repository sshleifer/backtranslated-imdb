This is so incredibly bad. Poor actors. You can say they are really trying to polish a bitch, but we all know you can't. Writing is so obvious and easy, it's sad to see them try to sell it. Humor and rhythm are so laborious, it's hard to believe that any of these good actors have signed up for it. <br /> <br /> That said, it's so terrible that we're struggling to look away from the screen. We just need to know where this labor goes. But it's only because we got it on TV. If we had actually paid for it, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So get 2 stars to be at least in a fun / charmingly bad way. And incidental music (as opposed to the very hard indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not nearly as good.
