Chris Kattan is a great Saturday Night Live sketch actor ... but he should probably leave the film industry alone, unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoyingly lively character who basically looks slightly retarded and at speed. Want to know the only fun parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, his interpretation of hiring me is fun. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can say that he is working hard to be a physical comedian, to whom he should not try because he is one. Still, his "demolishing the vet's office" is a bit ugly. This film made me develop a contraction of the eye. Avoid it at all costs and keep looking at SNL.
