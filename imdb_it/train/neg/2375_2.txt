Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth episode of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and yet another ugly sequel. I think this is linked to the last Dream Child sequel. I was lucky enough to have the Nightmare series DVD set on Elm Street for my birthday, so I could see all the sequels. I can say that I'm becoming more and more disappointed with these sequels, at least in the last two, it seems that Freddy has lost his advantage. It's almost as if writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that was not necessary, I'm sorry for Robert Englund, but this was far below what Freddy Krueger represents. <br /> <br /> Freddy is back, but he has something we don't know, a daughter. Maggie, doesn't realize that she's her father, but soon finds out what her dark secrets are and wants her help. He must do his best to resist his powers, but he is tough with all the good memories he has of his loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy doesn't give up without manipulating her in his ways. <br /> <br /> Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, eh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, linked to the fifth sequel to the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I prefer to watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to tell the truth. This has only bad acting, a stupid montage and, above all, a bad idea for a story. I didn't like the concept and this ruined the idea of ​​who Freddy Krueger really is, the master of the death of nightmares, not of Father Knows Best. <br /> <br /> 2/10
