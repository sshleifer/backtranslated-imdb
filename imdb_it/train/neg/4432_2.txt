Tatie Danielle talks about an awful old witch who torments her loving and unsuspecting family out of pure spite. There is some subtext that could relate to the French colonial past, but it is above all Danielle who does such things (like deliberately abandoning a small child in a park) that would soon have a man who took his teeth with broken fingers . Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the acting is fine and there is nothing really wrong with the concept, but it is just so SMUG. God, this movie loves itself. Too bad it's not as smart or funny as you think it is. The only impetus on the show - I'm sorry, the film - comes from Danielle getting meaner, and the only surprise comes from seeing the increasingly unlikely ways she does it. Exactly: just like in a sitcom, which is what it is, with the added bonus of delusions of magnitude and a run time of 110 minutes.
