Well, I watched this last night and the only thing that didn't make it completely terrible was that it was direct. There was no one to beat around the bush that this boy was the Anti-Christ. However, the film was poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the accident of the dentist to "Incident" or in the end, how the policeman miraculously ended up home in time to save the child without the police being called again. The death scenes were really bad and not funny at all. The boy who chose to play the Anti-Christ was boring and could have chosen a better son. Don't waste time looking at this.
