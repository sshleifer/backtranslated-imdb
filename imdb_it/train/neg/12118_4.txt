In 1972, after his wife left on his way, Elvis Presley started dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a beauty woman in a good mood, long-haired, adorable and statuesque, is designed to fill a void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce became final, Linda was already present as a girlfriend and traveling companion of the legendary performer until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a garish look at their love story and company. Linda takes care of all her wishes and desires of her lover. And also endure his medicines ingested by the handful and introduce her to his love affair with the valium. Sometimes this film is hard and heartfelt; a very unattractive look at the "King" and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is absolutely as horrible as Elvis. Besides acting all the way down it is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks Linda's class, but does the job quite well. The supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. Watching it twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review stop you from checking it out. For most of the Elvis fans I conferred with, this is not a favorite presentation.
