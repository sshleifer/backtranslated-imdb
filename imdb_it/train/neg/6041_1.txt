This story of three women is a very delicate study on: Muriël (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) the youngest, Laura (Els Dottermans) who is about 37 and Martha (Frieda Pittors) the oldest who is Muriël's mother. They live together in the same building. They have different expectations about life. The vital Laura wants a child. Muriël comes from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Marta dreams of her youth when she was a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this film, so wait for something, for example an accident, to dramatize this story. Over time, you discover that director Dorothée Van Den Berghe just wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing else. This film is disappointing because you expect women to learn from their experiences that it is not the case, so you remain with a feeling of emptiness.
