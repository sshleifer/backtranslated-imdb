This movie is so terrible, it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> At the beginning the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded man can write a better story! The actors are boring and lacking talent, maybe they were forced to play in this cheese movie. <br /> <br /> National Forest photo receptions are the only good ones in this film. I should try ashame, because I paid for this bad movie. We hope that no one makes a sequel or does a similar film with a worse plot :-)
