The film is a collection of clich√©s on almost everything out there. It has no kind of focus, no goal, no real message. The symbolism is pushed upwards and the stereotypes are abundant and outrageous. This film does not resist the temptation to do drama where it does not exist. Every little exchange of words immediately becomes a long and unjustified dialogue that is typical of an acting test. Where there is no substance in this exchange, the actors (no matter how good they normally are) cannot help but compensate with exaggerated emotions, alias "raising the stakes". Beyond acting, to put it simply. The direction is not helpful here. Nothing can save this non-story. He is forced, fake and boring to tears. Inexperiences in the portaray of punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90s outfits. The characters wander without a role, the details and the motive. The positions are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas and Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art torn. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it. <br /> <br /> Some movies have flaws. This film is a fault of Lee. He has sold out, like everyone else. It has become irrelevant. It has nothing more interesting to say. <br /> <br /> I no longer wish to see anything from this guy (which I will refrain from naming from now on).
