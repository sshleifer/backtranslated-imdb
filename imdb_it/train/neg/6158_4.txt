Once upon a time, in the mid-1990s, when I wrote for the DOCTOR that the fanzines and the entire fandom were holding their breath on the new American product DOCTOR WHO TVM. As soon as it was announced that the doctor's enemy that Master would play Eric Roberts, everyone scratched his head and exclaimed "Who is Eric Roberts?" I should point out that this was before the IMDB came online when all you had to do was type a name on this website for their resume, but an available soul wrote in a publication I wrote to explain that Eric Roberts was better known for a role in which he starred alongside F Murray Abraham, the film was named BY THE SWORD and concerned a fencing school. Roberts is best known for THE PAPA DEL GREENWICH VILLAGE and RUNAWAY TRAIN but this did not stop the person from putting the boot on both Roberts and THE SWORD and his mind was that this American Master with his southern accent was going at a debacle. Strangely most of the fans were furious about Roberts playing the Master but after seeing the DOCTOR WHO TVM a large number of fans (myself among them) I thought Roberts's performance was the best thing about disappointing American production <br / > <br /> Yeah I` ma DI THE SWORD was a film I wanted to see simply because it was the first time I heard the name of Eric Roberts but I didn't have the chance to see it until this weekend and I was pretty disappointed it. I don't know the fencing (all the others on this page seem obliged to mention if they fence or not. I don't complain) so I don't know how accurate all this is, but as I said the film feels a bit anachronistic, even if you've seen it in his release in 1991, the hairstyles seem to have passed some years ago together with the mixed cast of teenagers who do a little dance routine that makes you think that it wouldn't work much better if it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer in the mid-80s . You could argue that this would have meant that the relationship between Max Suba and Alexander Villard was off-center for most of the film, but I wasn't convinced of their love / hate relationship and Abraham and Roberts gave much better performances before and since BY THE SWORD
