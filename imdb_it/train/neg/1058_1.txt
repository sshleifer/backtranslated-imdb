No fireworks despite the violent action. <br /> <br /> Science fiction films that reflect quality are very scarce, largely because the transposition of imaginative themes from the genre to the screen too often is not effective due to insufficient funding or inadequate invention, and unfortunately for its producers, this work is lacking on both fronts, sadly in the case of the latter. Being substantially without a budget with which to operate, it is a grave mistake to attempt to represent such a range of events as those within this scenario and, in particular, the special effects of the space war that appear only clownish, while the seeds of the scriptwriters' imagination lies aground due to some of the most fatuous misunderstandings of the basic scientific principles to be found. Among these are frequent gunfire shootings within a sealed environment and a rebel law of gravity that allows cast members' freedom of movement while inanimate objects float weightless, but it is easier to accept them than to demand that any of the episodes have a plausibility basis. The plot involves an escape of prisoners sentenced for life by a penal colony of the space station to a rubbish dump on our moon and their various attempts to get the passage to Earth, with some few capable actors who are directed by the first-time Paolo Mazzucato , whose production team spends efforts like holographic pornography while ignoring a pressing and basic requirement for creating states of suspense and momentum. <br /> <br />
