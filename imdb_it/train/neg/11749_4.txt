Phil the Alien is one of those bizarre movies where humor is based on the whimsy of everything rather than on the final lines. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was very strange and rather funny but with the progress of the film I didn't find the funniest jokes or quirks. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget film (it was never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but in the end I lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine that this film might appeal to a stoner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something like this, but better try "Brother from another planet"
