I didn't know much about this movie before watching it, but I heard it had something to do with quantum physics, so I was interested. What I didn't know is that this is actually NOT A STORY but a group of new-age fanatics who love the sound of their own voice that talks about how little they know about basic quantum mechanics. I say that it belongs more to the Documentary category than to the Comedy or the Drama. <br /> <br /> Marlee Matlin is in the film, to give this New Age symposium a sort of plot. Its parts of the film feel horribly attached and are designed to show the speaker's thoughts, so we will not die of boredom. Matlin has a real job as a photographer, unlike the New Age hippy who crashes on the couch. We listen to the nameless people who wander about what quantum physics "means" to them. The only bright spot in this film was the speaker from India (I assume), but I think he showed up for the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> It seems that Barbara Eden has really let herself go and she continues on how quantum science has something to do with her crazy New Age beliefs. It seems that DS9's Quark is running out of money and also makes a brief appearance in the film. There is a lot of CGI whizbangs that we should be impressed with; the body cells are shown as molds for jelly dancing, because the directors have apparently seen Flubber too many times. <br /> <br /> The people in the film say that the people of Arawak on San Salvador thought that Columbus's ship the Pinta was invisible because the natives had never seen clipper ships before, as if people today had a way to know. Obviously they omit all this information and simply say "Columbus's ships were invisible to Indians in America". The film takes so many arrogant jumps. Thomas Young did a double-slit experiment around 1805 and discovered that light can resemble a particle a few times and a wave for some time. You certainly would never know * by looking at this stupid film because the only reference to it is that "atoms can be particles and waves". And this must mean that people can pass through walls, walk on water and never grow old if they only want a star !! Then I'm sure Marlee Matlin could stop being deaf if only * she believed * enough difficult. I am sarcastic, but this film is full of false hopes and beliefs that the people who marry them do not really hold up. <br /> <br /> These are the New Age kooks that have grasped quantum theory as if it reaffirms everything they believe about meditation, zero-point energy, crystal healing, etc. If these snake oil vendors really believed in the shit they were selling, couldn't they simply * wish * that their salaries existed instead of appearing in this film joke? We can listen to another nameless man, with no credentials we know of, talk on his sofa in front of the fireplace (or TV screen) about how he creates his life. Every time he was on the screen I wanted someone to rush in and plant a cake in his face. These people take themselves too seriously. Some other bald guy in a suit says that no one * ever * really touches anything because there is a magnetic force that prevents it at the quantum level. If only someone had entered the screen and punched him in the stomach, shouting "I'm not touching you! I'm not touching you!" A moral relativist in the film states that in reality "there are no good or bad things". So apparently it's okay for Hitler to kill millions of Jews to death? Another person says that "nothing like love" exists. It's just a chemical and we don't really love people, we're just dependent on the chemical rush we have when we're around them. I suspect this guy is doing this movie as a community service to be addicted to heroin for so many years. <br /> <br /> We witness a truly pathetic sequence in which two young adults wander around a wedding reception, seeing everything as RoboCop. They assess whether women are cows, dogs or foxes and a sexual position opens up on the scree. Marlee Matlin gets drunk at the wedding she's supposed to photograph and the next day she decides to love herself and take a bath because it's a beautiful snowflake. <br /> <br /> I liked it when the film said that people often find evidence for their pre-conceived notions. Maybe in this review I'm just seeing what I want to see, but I really wanted to see these people in the face, and it never happened. <br /> <br /> If you've never heard of the ideas presented in the film before, you might find them interesting, but there are better sources for all the ideas here. If you want to see a good movie about Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty, go see the man who wasn't there. If you want to read a good book on Quantum Field Theory, read Hyperspace by Michio Kaku. If you want to see a film that talks about different philosophies with imaginative images, see Waking Life (although it can sometimes seem boring, self-important and pretentious). All in all, you should go and read Robert Anton Wilson's Quantum Psychology or Prometheus Rising instead of wasting your time on this film. <br /> <br /> Normally I find it hard to give the films a score from 1 to 10, but this has been very easy for me: 1/10 stars. <br /> <br /> The title of the film is true. The people in this movie don't know # $ *! Hands down, the worst movie I've ever seen.
