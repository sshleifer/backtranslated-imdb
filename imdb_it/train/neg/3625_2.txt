This is a film that belongs firmly to the 50s. Surprisingly, the American Film Institute has chosen this for one of the best 100 American films of all time. I've seen virtually all the movies on that list, and this is by far the most disappointing. The musical numbers (and many, many of them) are VERY long and boring, and have no connection with the story. The end of the film has a horribly long ballet sequence, which of course has no real relationship with the story of the film. It must be admitted that it is very well done, that music is OK and that the dances are performed with the highest professional standards, but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and unpredictable and behaves in a non-polite way. His mental age is about 14. If you want to see a good musical made in the "golden age" of musicals, go see "Singing in the Rain".
