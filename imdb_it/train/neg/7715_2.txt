Yes it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon have cleaned up the trash of their minds and invented the worst comic, horror, Sc-Fi movie. If there is acting, it is terrible or exaggerated. Special effects; make your choice ... very low budget or kindergarten. Every thought economic clich√© is used. Undoubtedly a fun movie to watch. Worth a pack of six or two cold. Point your finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow almost like the size of a tow truck and begin to attack humanity. San Diego is a good place to start. Distracted scientists and soldiers must find ways to stop this red threat. The favorite features of this cult: David Miller, Eric Christmas, Al Sklar, Tom Coleman, Sharon Taylor and John Qualls.
