Really, BRAIN wrote it in the credits, not in BRIAN. <br /> <br /> OK, they didn't have the budget for a spell checker. All the money for production went to great old machines. Here at least two Packards are visible. One is a convertible Darin. A beautiful yellow Packard convertible. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the movie studio show that there was money spent on costumes and decorations. Old cameras, a Cyrus exterior, road signs and everything else needed to create a visually pleasing image was there. Written and directed badly. <br /> <br /> My DVD says it's about 104 minutes. It was more like 85 minutes. He finished without reaching a conclusion. There was a collision but no conclusion. The film has just broken against the credits. 99 cents for this. I paid 99 cents for this. I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and looked at my cat's face while he emulated more excitement. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds in the Cyrus scene after Darren McGavin received a call, it seemed, perhaps. .. this film would have a surprise that could make a movie interesting. Then he sat there. <br /> <br /> The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer (Tony Montoya) could have played a much more important part of all that was happening here. This cast may have made a good movie. I think if they cut the part of Brian and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound the same way as the band, then they got something. <br /> <br /> Here Kitty, Kitty ... <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
