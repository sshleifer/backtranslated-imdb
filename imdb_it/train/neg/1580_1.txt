this became a cult movie in Chinese university students, although I didn't watch it until it was broadcast on channel4, UK. <br /> <br /> full of artificial vertiginous claims, the plot is mediocre and unreal; the "spirit" he wants to convey is how independent artists "resist the commercialization of the music industry" and maintain the "purity of an artistic soul" and do not "sell themselves for dirty money". it's really dizzying and superficial; the diologue is mainly pathetic. acting is poor. sceenplay is full of pretended art. is a fantasy film for children and that's all <br /> <br />
