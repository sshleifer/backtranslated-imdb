As an engineer, I have to say that the first season of this show started very promising. Most of the applied mathematics was somehow plausible, and the relationships represented between the Eppes brothers and the father gave an interesting inspiration to the show. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show started to degrade, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in solving the crime is now absolutely meaningless and very ridiculous for all those involved in science and technology for the real. <br /> <br /> The involvement of the actors still feels good and I can imagine a fair the amount of money is still producing every episode, but in the end, this is degraded to a very unpleasant dish that is a mix between an action - C grade thriller and a CSI-style detective show. <br /> <br /> If you look at it, you will only go for the first season and maybe parts of the second. From then on I wouldn't waste my time. I myself gave the show mid-season 3. <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 stars <br /> <br /> We add up to 4 stars. Since Charlie no longer knows his math, I won't even worry about my fairness.
