Richard Dix is ​​a great, not very sympathetic industrialist who has almost worked to death. If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, he'll probably be better off if he ignores WHISTLER'S VOICE. <br /> <br /> This direct entry to William Castle has some great moments (the introduction and representation of Richard Dix's life through newsreels at the Citizen Kane), and some intriguing plot in the last reels. Dix's performance is generally quite good. But unfortunately, the right doesn't work enough because you don't end up buying that the characters would behave like them. Furthermore, the film turns from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 1930s film like a midsection (full of beautiful urban ethnic types that doesn't matter if they are not rich) and again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so. <br /> <br /> This is a decent film - it's worth seeing - but it took a little more time to establish a couple of characters and a female lead able to satisfy the needs of her role.
