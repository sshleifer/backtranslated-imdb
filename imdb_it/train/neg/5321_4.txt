A singularly funny little musical comedy that artificially tries to marry the explosion of rock'n'roll, then sharp, with the bourgeois sensibility of a suburban sitcom. The result is a mixture of burns that will not satisfy the audience that went for the music, but at least will keep their parents satiated. <br /> <br /> A quick look at the promotional review on the back of the video version should give you an idea of ​​the content. Tom Ewell is a drunken agent, exaggerated with such a small comic skill that you almost expect him to bellow "hi honey, I'm home!" The ad calls it "So funny in 'The 7 Year Itch'". It almost seems like an excuse. What other movie would sell on the fact that a leading actor was good at something else? It reads like "So funny in 'The 7 Year Itch' ... but it's rubbish in this". <br /> <br /> Mansfield, a beautiful girl with the 50-inch resources that is said, is, unfortunately, a Monroe affair basement with all the acting skills and comic timing of a decaying haddock. Its delivery in wood combined with the eighths of Ewell's OTT make this comedy a partnership from Hell. For its part, the sale gives us: "[Jayne Mansfield] whose most obvious talents are the cause of many of the film's greatest laughs!" As you can see, a film sold on the idea that the protagonist has a big chest is not the most sophisticated of things. Most of this "humor" is that men literally fall on themselves, their glasses crashing on the Mansfield site, etc. Only the Freudian nightmare of a bottle of milk overflows casts doubt on its "U" certificate. <br /> <br /> the musical side, the most adenine players are chosen. Do you really want to see Eddie Fontaine offer: "I love your eyes, I love your lips, they taste even better than the chips" in a song called "Cool It, Baby"? Only the arsonist Little Richard comes out of the MOR, even though he is forced to sing some of his dad's most friendly songs in a four-minute sequence. And how come all the actors sing without a single microphone? Attempts to satire in the sector are broad and childish in their conception. <br /> <br /> Technically, the image was quite advanced, with special effects (including a ghost by Julie London) and deluxe colors (which now seems flat and artificial, in fact, with its bleeding reds and tones fake-looking meat resembles a colored film). The direction, however, is not exceptional, and the sound quality is also rather poor. <br /> <br /> Maybe it comes down to the fact that it's so old. A time when men continued to smoke on the screen, disgustingly cute child actors commented as adults and black servants could only cook and dance. (Everything that happens here). Yet Some Like It Hot, The African Queen, Ben Hur and many others are examples of films of the period that can still be enjoyed today, so the "good at the moment" argument does not hold. In his heart The girl cannot help It is a cynical and condescending undertaking that does not tolerate close inspection. 4/10. <br /> <br />
