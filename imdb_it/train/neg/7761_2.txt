After a series of power cuts in a remote zoo of the island, the genetically modified saber tigers are at liberty and force the residents of the island. Friend, the science fiction channel has produced some "original" films, but I think this could be their worst so far! This "Jurassic Park" scam, poorly written and directed, offers all the usual clich√©s (mad scientists who think that the people killed by monsters are "expendable losses", characters who walk down long dark corridors alone, brain-dead teenage characters who only work in the film he died horribly, etc.), and, of course, no suspense. The special effects are atrocious ... the puppet heads in the close-ups of the beasts of the title are bad enough, they look like stiff dolls in plush, but the CGI ?? that makes computer-generated dinosaurs in "Walking with dinosaurs" seem alive for comparison? they are simply terrible. There is a bit of cold blood, but most seem rather unconvincing. Oh, and the scene of the scientist's death is really one of the worst things I've seen in years. I couldn't even laugh it was so bad! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time, this is absolutely negative. <br /> <br /> 2/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and here are some interesting facts for you? This film has borrowed musical cues from the 2003 science fiction movie "Alien Hunter", which was far superior to this piece of shit.
