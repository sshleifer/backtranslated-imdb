attention: this film tells many love stories without coherence. <br /> <br /> The only intention of this film seems to show love in many different ways. <br /> <br /> Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no character development and almost no storyline. Just a sketchy idea of ​​a plot. The writer tried to build turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer. However, this didn't work because you didn't know the characters before or these "jokes" were simply silly. <br /> <br /> This is a film about love that can't reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more, I don't know and I don't care.
