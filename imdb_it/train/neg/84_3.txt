As a child I thought the weapon used by the murderer was cold, however I was a child and so I was a bit silly. Even though he was a stupid kid, the movie plot was stupid and a little boring when the killer wasn't using his light knife to kill people. What amazes me is that the film has a really solid cast. What script they read when they agreed to be in this film as it is definitely boring and just a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole film seems to revolve around the aliens and the only weapon. The plot has two children and a guy with an alien encounter, years after flash, and there seems to be a return like in the mix. Dead animals to be explored and for some reason the guy gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light electrocution. Seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you're going to have a murderer, have some good scenes of death, if you're going to have alien encounters show more than one weird thing about light whirlwind, and if you're going to have sabers read then call you Star Wars.
