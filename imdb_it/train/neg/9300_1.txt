Spoiler Alert Well, I think this film is probably the worst movie ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood (without heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is bad (piano and orgue ... come on!). The acting is ... well there is no acting! <br /> <br /> There's a guy who really goes into the woods looking for his missing wife and takes the time to have sex with a stranger. <br /> <br /> The killer is a fat and unpredictable clown who can't run more than one turtle! <br /> <br /> Every cast member is stupid and the director effortlessly included all the clicks of the sniper movies in the film. <br /> <br /> The end is so far the stupidest ever made. Think about it: the guy (ken hebert) who plays skill is about the same as his writing (it's the brain behind this flop), he invites a colleague and two of his friends to his cabin for the weekend and kills them. .. Monday morning back to the office as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The tragedy is that Mr. Hebert tries to make us believe that this is a family affair that has been going on for generations (his uncle is the killer clown) <br /> <br /> Obviously NO policemen will interrogate him after his collaborator disappears ... <br /> <br /> WHATEVER. <br /> <br />
