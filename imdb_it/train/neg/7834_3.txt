I don't usually write reviews, but I can't understand why this is rated so high and I wanted to give a warning to horror lovers, since I can only assume that all those high grades were given by average television observers. <br /> <I only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliche, it wasn't even fun anymore. the same old stories you've already seen / read a couple of times - living toys, evil things from other dimensions ... and it's not just that these stories are not innovative, they are also rather ugly versions of those clichÃ©s. I would prefer for example "chucky" and "silent hill" on these two episodes at any time. and don't even ask for visual effects ... those of the first episode are fine, but those of the second ... terrible. it seems that the project of some film students has gone wrong. blood ... or blood ... erm ... nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> It might be interesting for a ten-year-old boy who probably hasn't seen / read many scary stories yet (although I'd rather recommend "beyond imagination" - now that's what I call a decent mystery TV show) . but for a fan of adult horror this is worthless. I only gave the 3 points because in fact there is some nice photography (especially in the second episode) and some nice acting.
