I hated this crap, every Friday as part of TGF was, and constantly sucked big time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something fun, look at "No On Would Tell" with Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really hilarious, shows exactly why no one has ever followed a good movie career after making a terrible TV show. This show really sucks, I hate those kids, and Bob Saget needs to jump off a bridge for ever doing this crapfest. I've seen funerary things everywhere but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the minimum that humanity has to offer in terms of art and entertainment.
