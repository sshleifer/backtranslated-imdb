First of all, the title character is not even the main character of the film. He is the companion of the cult leader. The actor who plays Igor believed that screaming loudly, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile as he drools his eyes out would be a great way to scare people. Even Igor had the annoying habit of screaming (because he really never spoke) in a high-pitched voice. He would also say idiotic jokes. For example, when the cult leader kills one of his followers with a circular saw, Igor after seeing it, yells "Paul! No Paul! Why did you do it? I might have cut it! So clean!" In another scene, Igor tells a victim that he should "get his instruments for surgery because at this time it was his time to operate". Apart from the bad acting, the ending made no sense because as the story builds that little steam that reaches its climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his moody companions are killed, he shows up twice to kill the remaining "good guys". The film offers no explanation, just telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the psychiatric hospital. What??? The bottom line is don't waste time watching this movie. I wish I could go back to the moments that I missed watching this.
