I saw the hope when I was 11 on TV. I liked the trilogy. Thus, when the possibility of finally seeing one in the cinema was not transmitted. I went to the cinema knowing that what I was about to see was not a movie, but a TV movie. However being a fan I couldn't resist. But this Omen movie I saw at a midnight screening didn't bring shivers brought laughter. Laughable dialogue such as "it is written that if a child cries during baptism, he rejects there god". What nonsense. There are no decent pieces. Faye Grant so good in V is wasted with this script from hell. No surprise and no fun. However I laughed loudly to our bad times. Truly Pathetic.1 out of 10
