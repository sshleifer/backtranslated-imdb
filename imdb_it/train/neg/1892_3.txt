I read Chris_m_grant's comment from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote: "A fantastic documentary from 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful." <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Chris and the people who are interested in the Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran, the mountains and landscapes of Zagros and have seen the film Grass, A Nation's battle for life. These traditions you saw in the film have endured for centuries and will continue as long as life lasts. I also come from this region of Iran. I'm a Bakhtiari. <br /> <br /> Chris, I'm sorry to bother you, but the Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Iraq as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and distinct countries. Taking an Iranian for an Iranian is almost like taking an American for a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
