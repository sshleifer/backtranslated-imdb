Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a strange idea and doesn't do anything to make a story out of it. Basically Alice from the number 4 is pregnant and her baby is infested with Freddy who gives him an outlet to persecute his friends. This has the least number of deaths in the entire series and the wise cracks are rather scarce, so neither horror fans nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I don't have much to say about this. It's interesting enough to see the characters of Alice and Dan come back from four, but it's not worth watching a finished movie. Not favorable and not happy, perhaps only the competing management saves him from being the worst of the series.
