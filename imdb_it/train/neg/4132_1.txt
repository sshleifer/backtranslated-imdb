The characteristic of early-21st century cinema allows us to bring together the various evil and evil creatures. We haven't seen stuff like that from Godzilla against King Kong and the like. It always sounds great on paper when you're gleaning and in the haze of good things you have an inspired idea and see the whole execution before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then come and write it. Great ideas like all vampires are women. Ergo warm, seductive mortal but in a sense I want to perish in a certain sense. And all the zombies are men. Well, is that what men are like a woman just after being dumped or betrayed right? So it seems all good to actually do it. Then the rot begins to creep in. Mosters fights. Not much happens Another fight Philosophical philosophy and cod Eureka we have found how to win. Great fight again and at the end. Sounds great, doesn't it? If it had been transformed into an independent company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with its eyes set: it shines instead of what the fans want. Everything could have been drenched in beauty.
