I really had to take a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because last night the audience was so mortified by the dialogue that (I'm not kidding) halfway out. Shot as if the director thought he was approaching a new daring territory by presenting a homosexual training story, the film uses the graphics inspired by David Lynch with the acting inspired by Fassbinder. The performances in this film are so boring and boring that I thought one of the actors would have fainted from what they apparently did not get inspired by the script. What's worse is that it is colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I don't know who this director thinks he is; perhaps it has the pretensions of the surreal as Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all the aforementioned directors show a level of erudite sensitivity that is seriously lacking here. I could understand the significance of this film about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why worry about this cinematic film? There is nothing new to see here.
