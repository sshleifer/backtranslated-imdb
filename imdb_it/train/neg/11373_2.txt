It is not obvious to see this film (so I advise the spectators to look for the people who present their case) but this presentation on the reality of Islam and its encouragement to violence and intolerance towards all non-Muslims lacks objectivity , and also completely fails to factor into the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim must interact with non-Muslims, but every realist is able to understand that not all humans who feel they are followers of Islam, agree and respect all the principles of such faith and system. There is reason to question the speakers a lot, so that viewers should see the presentation with healthy skepticism; do not swallow everything, hook, align and sink, without thinking of your own. <br /> <br /> A specific one, for example, is the search for the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who do not believe any of these statements. I am neither a Muslim ever. I never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a member of every faith. But I am an intelligent and perceptive man. While the film is quite disturbing, in its presentation of how some Muslims see their obligation to Islam; I remind you that Islam has much more than fundamentalist opinions. Just as they are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians, so too are variations in the intensity of beliefs and duties between Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you must have the salt shaker on hand. A grain will not be enough, you will need more. Please use your mind and think for yourself, research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits into it based on something more than what is said in 98 minutes of video. There is a common thread of political affiliation between those who put this film together, indicating a precise preconception. Be your brain.
