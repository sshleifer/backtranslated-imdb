I have to admit, there are some books with matching films that I actually read before seeing the film adaptation. Nineteen Eighties is one of those rare cases. The book was great. It was engaging and interestingly prophetic. But the film is simply sucked. It's easily the worst movie I've ever seen. The only reason I didn't turn it off after the first 5 minutes was the fact that watching the movie was half a two-part lesson assignment. It was dark and grotesque, but did nothing to achieve the right atmosphere. The acting was nothing above average, and considering the fact that there wasn't much to play, this was very disappointing. The book, for example, did not give me the impression that Winston was not able to pull out more than a single syllable at a time. Boring, disturbing and visually unattractive, the film has totally cannibalized the book. Wait a second ... isn't he English?
