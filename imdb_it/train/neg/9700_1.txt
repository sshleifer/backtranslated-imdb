I agree with most of the other guys. A waste of photons and precious time. <br /> <br /> Almost no joke is worth the paper on which it was written. The only strong point of my pov is Olli Dittrich in the role of Pinocchio. ("Egal, ich muss eh Waldsterben") This is reminiscent of the old days with RTL Samstag Nacht. It is difficult to describe the actors' performances, since many of them don't even seem to have fun during production and "do their thing". The camera is fine, the plot is ridiculous, I think you will be ashamed even if you talk about it with a lot of beers. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I yawned all the time, wondered how a script like this could even be considered for production and I waited for the end. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son was happy, but then he is happy with so little at this age :-) <br /> <br /> However, a score of 1 point here is almost 1 point more ...
