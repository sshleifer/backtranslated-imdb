The initial 5 minutes gave me hope. Then Meyers proved he only had a good idea for the rest of the film. Absolute minimum common denominator absolute humor. Painful vision A complete job. Written without a doubt in less than a week, just like the first one. Give Meyers the hook and lock it in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And don't let it out until you've developed a decent script for something, anything. He has it in him. These Austin Powers things are simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Let Goldmember sink in without leaving a trace.
