If the original casting idea had been kept (looking for Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Unfortunately, racism has had to enter the scene (literally) and ruin it. The predominantly black production staff could not allow the antagonist to be black, so they exchanged the roles of Rutger and Ice-T. This was just the beginning of the downward spiral of this film. The approach of the press room of Ernest Dickerson to "direction" only verified that it was another assignment of affirmative work. Main shot, end up, end up. Gads, 'Who's Line Is It Anyway' also uses a more creative creative work. Eric's rewrite of "The Most Dangerous Game" is at least an attempt to modernize the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivation as to why the characters are doing it. We are never given the motivation, apart from "no one will miss these people", because the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Apart from a John McGinley's heartfelt performance, and an honest work by Charles Dutton, don't worry about it. A bit of a curiosity, there was a real drunk driving accident during filming that injured F. Murray Abraham, and caused the death of the intoxicated young driver who caused the accident.
