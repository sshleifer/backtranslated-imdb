First of all, I firmly believe that Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the boring emotional films of the 70s and 80s, the films of this place have begun to contain some humor. Imagine .. Real comedies have been made! The movies were starting to get fun and funny, unlike the long, dark, depressing and boring ones. <br /> <br /> During the '90s and' 00s several truly fantastic films were made by a "new generation" of directors. Movies after films have been praised by critics and have played a lot of money. It became the norm! <br /> <br /> Then came United ... <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILERS * It's just not fun. Not once. Never. But the thing is ... We think it's fun. Because we are used to Norwegian films to be funny. Especially with a cast like this with some really funny comedians. But .. They don't say or do anything funny! Where is the humor? Let me see the humor! Is it the clumsy employee of Harald Eia? Is the football coach extremely overly unrealistic? Are these comments from Arne Scheie? The film is not funny at all! <br /> <br /> But this is not my main line on United. This is predictability. (And this is where I fear the Norwegian comedies have been blocked since I saw it in many other films as well). All the while, you only know that it will end well. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the film, and everyone gets exactly what he deserves in the end. There is absolutely no room for surprises! <br /> <br /> All in all I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. It was the only film that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in Norwegian cinema ... again! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/6
