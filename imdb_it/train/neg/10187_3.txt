Stupid drug, senseless for a jet assembled in a few hours by mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (piloted by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche racing car that runs on petrol sludge decades old, led by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as the runaway techno -wiz who can McGyver's spare parts in a radio receiver capable of detecting all frequencies simultaneously, and who somehow learned how to acquire and use chemicals to produce high-volume explosives in a perfectly peaceful society. Much like an idiot. Terrible waste of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace could at least be forgiven for the fact that this was just his second film.
