HeidiJean really saw this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Dull, insipid and completely devoid of imagination and heart. I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought Carly Pope could play the lead role in this movie! The woman does not have a detectable personality and offers a completely lackluster performance. Baransky was very good as usual and provided the only interesting minimum of the whole affair. Probably his involvement was the only reason this project was green to begin with. Maybe I expect too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas, but I sat down to this thing thinking that with a different director and a JJ with an actress who could at least arouse sympathy, it could have been a good little movie.
