It is the nature of companies to try to capitalize on the success of others. Here we have a film that takes elements from the previous 'Dracula' (1931) and 'Frankenstein' (1931) - in a Germanic city the village leaders believe that vampires (in the shape of bats) were the cause of recent deaths of victims without blood. Although filmed at Universal (and at the Bronson caves!) It's a feature of Poverty Row; it is not right to compare it with those previous, more expensive and higher quality films. <br /> <br /> From the chilling and familiar music of the main titles (which must have been by Mischa Bakalienikoff), through the talking but well done opening sequence, we expect the arrival of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye for give us a good movie of the 1930s mystery. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen. This is disappointment. <br /> <br /> We get little more than the formal elements of these films, but at a slow pace, low budget, not enough from Dwight Frye, the exaggerated presence of Maude Eburne (Zia Gussie), and premise for Lionel Atwill (Dr . von Niemann) to request human blood or as mind control over his servant Emil (Robert Frazier) ever clarified. <br /> <br /> Don't look at the technicolor 'Dr. X '(1932) - which also reads Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, but as a father and daughter - before looking at this as I did; is an Oscar winner by comparison. So look at this first. Structurally, "The Vampire Bat" is still not so beautiful. It moves along with too much chatter or useless comic relief, without focusing strongly on vampire wickedness. <br /> <br /> Also 'Dr. X 'and' Mystery of the Wax Museum '(both 1932 and co-star of Fay Wray), Lionel Atwill's most famous appearances are the only armed gendarme in' Son of Frankenstein '(1939) and as Moriarity in' Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Arma '(1943). Dwight Frye steals all his manic scenes in "Dracula" (1931). Like the "young lovers", Melvin Douglas and Fay Wray have a nice kissing scene, but that's all. It can be seen in "The Old Dark House" (1932), and Fay is dragged by Joel McCrea in "The Most Dangerous Game" (1930). Then there is his classic "screamer" from 1933. Too bad that more time, money and rewritings were not available for this film to better show the talents and chemistry of Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye. Unfortunately, therefore, this sadly disappointing film only gets a 4.
