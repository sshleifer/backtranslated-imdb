The film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is incredibly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge act and superstar, but his sense of irony is just extremely interesting and physically fun. His fans will say he is rudely honest, and it could be true. But it is also shrill, with an unforgivable and in-the-face bravado that does not fit well in a film of this genre. He doesn't want to be nice - and he's certainly not out to make friends - and that will always make many people screw the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material here is seriously lacking. The director Nicolas Roeg was executive producer and, although not directed by him, the film has all its cool and detached style. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their strangest touch was that all of Sandra's internal viewers seemed completely bored - a feeling that many real viewers will probably share. * 1/2 from ****
