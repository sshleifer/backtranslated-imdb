Sitting down to watch the fourteenth season of the Bachelor ("On the Wings of Love"), I knew that I would find myself for an "interesting" time. I had seen some of the previous Bachelor's seasons pass; watching an episode or two and missing the next three or so. I find that the Bachelor is often attractive and intriguing, although its quality and morality are often lacking. <br /> <br /> "On the Wings of Love" describes the journey of Jake, a 31-year-old commercial pilot from Dallas, Texas, to find true love, as true love as can be found on a show of appointments with the theatrical reality of a season. Jake meets 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. He begins to know them a little, but it is mostly superficial; how much can you get to know someone in some 5 minute conversations? Jake tries to make his true intentions known from the start, at least to the public. He noticed that he doesn't just want love or a good time, but he wants a boyfriend or a wife. We can only assume that it made it clear to women in the competition too. If this is the case, it could explain, to some extent, some of the actions of women. Women are super competitive. Even if they don't know Jake yet, they are still there to win, regardless of the cost. <br /> <br /> Not only were women competitive, but they were also sure of you. Threats, backslides and "Watch out!" all show that even these women were not there for a good time. Jake noticed that he wasn't just looking for sex appeal, but was looking for a "connection". However, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to impress Jake with said sex appeal. Have they arrived at the villa in skimpy clothes? both low-cut and short. <br /> <br /> While some girls seemed to retain their sense of decorum, others did not understand that memo at all. A girl, Channy, noticed that Jake was a "good boy" who could be a "bad girl". He went on to say that Jake could land on his "track at any time". He had flack from the other girls for his provocative statement which showed their grip on these situations. <br /> <br /> So a reality dating show couldn't be that bad, could it? In addition to the obvious question of sex-related attraction, there are other problems that touch on this seemingly harmless spectacle. Is this the right way to find a future partner? compete for someone's attention by showing off themselves in extreme proportions? Unfortunately, however, this is what America has reduced dating these days: pleasure and sex without commitment and some happiness on the side. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the premature emotional attachment with which many of the girls bind themselves to Jake. Some girls in particular seemed too attached. One girl said "If I didn't get that first impression, it will kill me!" As mentioned before, they don't know him yet and she was talking about a specific rose, not just one of the 15 roses so as not to be eliminated. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, seemed to have some problems with the attachment to Jake. The other girls also noticed him. After a particular outburst from Michelle, Vienna claimed that Michelle had a "mental breakdown and we were here only an hour." Michelle had the last rose of the evening at the first show ?? elimination just missing? and he was extremely emotional about it. The other girls thought it was simply ridiculous. Another girl cried, but because she was eliminated. <br /> <br /> It started with Survivor, and it took off from there ?? reality TV. Show our entertainment interests as a country; if we were not watching the shows and giving them good grades, the networks would not continue to manage them. The only logical conclusion that can be drawn is that a sufficient number of America is hooked. One thing is clear: America (in general) loves reality TV and its ensuing traps. <br /> <br /> This asks me to ask myself: why do we even like reality TV? What is it that attracts us? Is it because we see the similarities with our lives, or because we want to be sure that we are more stable and less pathetic than others? Whatever we are attracted to, we should be alert to the media and entertainment that we allow to fill our minds. I'm not saying that all TV reality shows are bad; however, I am saying that we must evaluate each of them. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for criticism: Season Premier and Episode 2.
