Take an original SciFi movie and mix up some alternative / revisionist history and get "Aztec Rex". Apparently Hernand Cortes, before conquering the Aztec empire, first had to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and his partner. This is the thrust of this film. Given the plot he could really suck; the fact that it's just a little sucked in is a tip of the cap for writers. There are some problems. For beginners, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering like Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose who plays Gandhi. And although Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs here seem to be interpreted by an all-Hawaiian ensemble. Leaving aside, the T-Rex (es) looks pretty good, although every time one of them is shot, he just blew CGI. And they die too easily; I suppose if a T-Rex were in real life they could probably be shot down or at least injured by some rather rudimentary sixteenth-century weapons. But it takes something far from the film. There are also some graphic scenes of T-Rex swallowing, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they worked well. There is a lot of action, and the entire colonization angle is prevalent throughout but it doesn't overwhelm the dinosaur corner, unlike the other recent original SciFi dinosaur movie "Warbirds". Overall, a mediocre film (but respectable by the original SciFi standards) that values ​​a modest 4.
