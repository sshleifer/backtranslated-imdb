This is a film that makes you say 2 things ... 1) I can do much better than this (recite, write and direct) 2) this is so serious that I have to leave a review and warn others ... <br /> <br /> It looks like it was shot with my video flip. I too believe that my friend who told me to watch this has a revenge against me. I noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video; It must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this movie. One of the worst 3 movies I've ever seen. I hope the writers and the director leave the business. not even talented enough to advertise !!!!!
