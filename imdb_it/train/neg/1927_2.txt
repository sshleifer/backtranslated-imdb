(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure film rights for his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He refused them, insisting that no one could have done better than the wonderful television special of Chuck Jones in 1966 (even in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience in writing the script for The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T) of 1953. When the good Doctor died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still stubbornly refused to sell film rights. But with the common use of CGI effects that become reality, Mrs Geisel has changed her mind. Universal gave her a generous offer that she accepted; he also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as a title character. Presumably she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, who makes us one of us. <br /> <br /> The film received a budget of $ 123,000,000 (which is even more than the cost of Heaven's Gate, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went right to elaborate makeup, set design and special effects (which are weakened <br /> <br /> somehow from rather nebulous cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money has been put aside to get a better script than the one that Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (the scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), Which made a much better use <br /> <br /> of a high budget) delivered. Considering that the television special was a taste of 26 minutes without ads, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more basic information on the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the object of ridicule, including a particularly humiliating experience, a Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that afflicts our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. The problem is that it seems a rather long time of 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging the story. It might not seem so bad if only the Grinch was a little more ... well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later was animated by a cunning fox, whose chatty attempts to hijack the holiday season were weakened by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of the heart. Carrey's Grinch is a strong, hyperactive and, at times, a delinquent who, when he made the "Cheermeister" party, destroys the anger-stricken town square of Whoville <br /> <br /> (we hope the scenario has a taste as good as it seems). This undermines the screenplay's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down to Whoville so indifferent (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> The vision of Whoville of Dr. Seuss was a small town populated by honest people who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The film's Whoville is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic nymphs; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensive <br /> <br /> hypocritical as the film industry has benefited greatly from American consumerism, and since this film has contributed to it with a large merchandising campaign <br /> <br />. <br /> <The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old murderer who entered this spurious Santa Claus is now older and wiser, constantly questioned about the false values ​​of the Whos and is trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (his main scene from the original is re-staged, making it appear out of character). <br /> <br /> seems to be the only one who knows that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, making it a completely different and more boring character. <br /> <br /> Those who celebrate Christmas should first accept a piece of coal in their stockings <br /> <br /> on the morning of December 25 of a copy of this attempt too hard, exaggerated, atrociously boring, with bare hands, to transform classic children into a feature film. It shows once and for all that darkness, vulgarity, manipulation and heaviness are inadequate substitutes of charm, intelligence, sincerity and heart. The people of Universal should get down on their knees and thank God that this stinking $ 123 million stink bomb bombed $ 260 million on the domestic market or they wouldn't be here today. He also made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!
