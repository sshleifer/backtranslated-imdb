don't expect much from this movie. In many ways this film resembles a film that Doris Day starred in 1956, title, Julie. In this film Doris, who was a flight attendant, hostess, in those days, landed the aircraft after her shy husband, played by Louis Jordan, shot the captain. He did a much better, more convincing job than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and manages to land without the control tower. I know a bit of 747 aircraft, I'm also a flight attendant. As I said, don't expect much from this movie, it was done on a low budget. Manufacturers were cheap to use an airplane with an airline name on it. Oceanic is a name that many films have used. The only inscription on this plane was the name of the company that made the aircraft.
