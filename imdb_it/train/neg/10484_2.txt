Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this project can be accomplished. It is by far the worst Elvis movie of all time, totally unattractive, stupid and full of errors about The King. Come, Elvis's tomb in a public park? A mention of Suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast try to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks' cameo is a surprise, but the guy who plays young Elvis sucks. Overall, the film has no fun and becomes more boring after a minute. If you want to watch a cheap, crazy but absolutely funny movie about Elvis, I really recommend "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
