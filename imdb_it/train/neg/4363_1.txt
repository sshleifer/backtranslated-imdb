It is difficult to find positive sides in this film. It seems that the producer needed to make a penny without too much effort and so we were treated with a complete Galaxy projection which is the slowest excuse for a film in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action scenes than the two policemen and much less than Galaxy would have been the way to go. Obviously this would add to the budget, so they decided to fill the space with that unfortunate replica. Mrs. Albright looks excellent and her acting is top notch. Even Mrs. Stabs, whom I had heard of but hadn't seen on screen, seemed very desirable, but seems to lack a basic acting talent. Ms. Albright aside, this is real garbage.
