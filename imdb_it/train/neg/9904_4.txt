The movie "Gung Ho!": The story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with the intention of raising the morality of the American people during World War II. Show with the best way in which the cinema can constitute a body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and not artistic. In a propaganda film it is useless to judge the director and the actors. Watch that movie if you want to know how propaganda works in movies or if you have a lot of fun with Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to watch a movie for World War II, there are much better and more objective ones. I rated it 4/10.
