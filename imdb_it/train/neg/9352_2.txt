You can often say that a film has not turned out as it should with the heavy use of a narrator. This film presents this device in everything. Richard Jobson is not entirely satisfied with writing directly and even financing part of this film, adding to his credits by reading excerpts from his own semi-autobiographical writing that combined with a beautiful montage manages to overlook what is a boring and depressing story that must be confused about the real art house. Kevin McKidd performs well. All the others are in place. <br /> <br /> Budget constraints have meant that all the scenes are shot in the light of day, although most are obviously intended for the night, even if you know serious alcoholics who operate mainly during the day, so for me adds a touch of realism. <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who can't age a single day in the odd years between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has between 18 and 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
