We rented it last night. The opening (2001) lasted too long WAAAAAAAAAY. The hitchiker scene had no purpose. Some scenes were only delayed. I knew this in advance, Chevy Chase was around for less than 2 minutes. No problem. Here are the best parts: <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield song <br /> <br /> Total: 7 minutes of good material on a 75-minute movie <br /> < br /> Everything else was either not funny or stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some advice: if you want a crude movie that spoils TV and movies, rent "Kentucky Fried Movie". If you want a less crude movie about TV and movies, rent "AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON" or "UHF" <br /> <br /> Otherwise, don't worry about renting this movie. You will save 2-3 dollars. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best film is STILL "Modern Problems"
