Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the film is true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I have to pass a movie, I'm the: <br /> <br /> Director <br /> <br /> Director of Photography <br /> <br /> Editor <br /> <br /> You can NEVER miss the damn Boom microphone that comes in and out of the movie for almost all the chapters in the film, how I can have fun and focus on the story and believe in the damn thing when it comes to mind technicians of the realization of a film !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> WAITING FOR THE DVD OR NOT DRINKING
