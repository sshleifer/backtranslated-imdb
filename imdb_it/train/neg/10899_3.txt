Economic and obscure stories and recitations. Not a single good line, not even a bad enough line to be good, and no memorable deliveries. Even the blazon mounted with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun there was. The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists were neither gruesome nor credible. The "homoerotic" nuances were uselessly docile and unsatisfactory, and they were limited to the young who caressed their chest while they were flaccid in their boxers. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but some action could have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake.
