Don't worry about wasting your money on this movie. Don't even get into your car and think you could see this movie if you don't like others. If you have to watch a movie this weekend, go see Batman again. <br /> <br /> The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random format of the horror film. Dato: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to discover all the clues that honest policemen can't put together, and an innocent and excessively curious woman, yet beautiful and strong with whom the public would like to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add very poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's get some monsters for a little "spin" on the plot. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, and the characters incredible - Borat was more credible than this. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers *** and someone can, please, tell me how a butcher's jacket can bounce a bullet from the person after being hit without even making sure that the person shot ??? I'm in the army. We need this kind of thing for us. <br /> <br /> 1 in 10, and place it in rounded decimals to give it the lowest possible score.
