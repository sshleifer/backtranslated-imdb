This movie could have been a decent b-movie if 3/4 of the movie wasn't so focused on sex scenes. I mean, he's an addict, and I'm sure there's a lot more going on with drug addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis. Michael Des Barres did a good job considering what he had to do, which wasn't much. At one point or another, he should have laughed at him, because his character was so pitiful. Nastassja Kinski was fine in her role as an interested sexual therapist, but she could have done more and I'm not suggesting she have sex. The person who impressed me most in this film was Rosanna Arquette in her convincing role as a loving and worried wife. There is something beautiful inside and outside that strongly attracts me. He played that role and while you were watching the movie, you start to feel bad for her. <br /> <br /> "Diary Of A Sex Addict" while not an Oscar material or a modern classic by anyone's standards, it is quite informative and does a good job of showing you how personal demons can take over and ruin things in life that you think highly.
