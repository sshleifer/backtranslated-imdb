This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen and quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actresses were horrible and it seemed that they were trying too hard to play their roles as jerks, tough guys, jerks, they know everything, etc. And the bigfoot itself was terrible. It seemed to be a kind of computer-generated image from the days of Atari & Intellivision. At one point, towards the end of the film, while an army of sasquatchs was chasing the remaining survivors, one was shot and while running, he looked like a poor man version of donkey kong himself! And one gets hit by a bullet and the blood that comes out of it is just a horrible animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Go ahead for too much music (classical score or whatever you call it) for the whole movie. It never ended. Oh yes, even the movie is boring. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they pay to rent this movie and spend it in a gallon of gas or in a menu of values ​​somewhere. REALLY FANTASTIC!
