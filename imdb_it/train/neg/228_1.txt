I thought it was a movie set in New York: wrong! It's a bit set in the British countryside. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama ... Well, until the last third, because after the story becomes totally "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a French presidential term. It means, close to nonsense even if the reasons would like to bring a sincere feeling. <br /> <br /> What's left for me? Perhaps, a good actress duo: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the red cop is a bit invisible to me. The tall doctor surprises with her fist, and McDowell offers an excellent acting as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost silent attitude. This kindness leaves me perplexed, because like other good artists or directors, the same pattern repeats itself over and over again. In his case, it is like, whatever the film, it is always the same character defined by his feelings, by his values, that lives endless and different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive side of this film is its feminine touch and the different interesting points of view. Women each have their own way of life, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learns to witness how one and the same reality can be perceived in many ways as people. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film is quite visible, but the big final cuts the desire for a future vision.
