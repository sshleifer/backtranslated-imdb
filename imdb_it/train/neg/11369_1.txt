This is quite ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims living throughout the United States, the United States and around the world. Religion has over a billion followers. I myself was born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I was taught to love my country and work to contribute to society. I am very dedicated to what follows and the teachings of my religion have been emphasized through life to educate and prepare for success through education in order to contribute to the world. I know many Muslims from all over and have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I still have to meet a person who believes we should hurt someone or not accept other religions other than people in the media ... I wonder why ... It is also sad that these extremists are the ones the media uses to represent an entire religion. It is a religion of one billion people, and these are less than 1%, I am sure that other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK, by the IRA and many others who are simple small-scale extremists who use obsolete and not literal passages of the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge, personal or business through their so-called religion
