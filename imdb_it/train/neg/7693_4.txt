Is there anything that happens in this film that is NOT predictable? I do not think so. Basically the film is a cliché after clichés and in reality nothing has ever been a surprise. It makes the film extremely predictable and for this reason the film is seriously devoid of tension. So for a thriller it is not tense and quite unpredictable, but also as a drama it is a failure. This is because the film its story is highly unlikely. I mean, in no way could this ever happen in real life, like the way events happen in this movie. So the film has a real suspense and credibility problem. <br /> <br /> But it's really the clichés that kill the movie. Sometimes he did chronic things. Everything is so formidable in this film. The predator is portrayed as a cold insensitive, almost psychopathic as a sexually frustrated boy and the victim as a naive young woman, who behaves as if she didn't see any of this. Everything that happened in the film was so obvious and everything seemed to happen for a reason. Like the sequence in which the "predator" corrects the broken machine of the "victims". This must be one of the oldest cliches in the book. I knew what the film was trying to achieve after that point. I tried to look as if the teacher and the student were really growing towards each other through the eyes of other people around them. It was so incredibly obvious and cheap that I almost wanted to stop watching the movie after that point. The film is full of moments like these. <br /> <br /> The title may suggest that it is a cheap porn movie, but this is actually a game created for TV movies. Which means that everything is slowly happening and the film spends its time on character development and secondary plots not necessary to make the film even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> I admit that Elizabeth Berkley is a pretty good acting in this film. It makes some of the clichés and events even sometimes almost realistic. His Hollywood career ended after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven film "Showgirls", so unfortunately it will probably still appear only in movies and TV series like this one. It is a waste of his talent and certainly deserves better. All the other characters are a disappointment. Corey Sevier plays the typical guy rich in untouchables and the way the main character's husband is interpreted is even worse. He looks more like a frustrated sexual predator than the real predator of the film. He basically tries to have sex with his wife in every sequence. He wakes up, wants sex. Before going to sleep, he wants sex. Come home, want sex. It might be a realistic thing but I don't know, it didn't seem right for a film like this and for history in general. <br /> <br /> A film full of clichés and I can't think of any reason why anyone should ever watch this movie. It is predictable and therefore also lacks suspense and credibility. It is not a "horrible" film, but sometimes it is certainly watchable, but all the weak elements and clichés of the film make it even far from a recommendable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
