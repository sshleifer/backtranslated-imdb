Now, I don't deny that when I bought this product on eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible print-out work by the master of comedy that I like so much. However, I was soon disappointed. I apologize to those who enjoyed it, but I found the Compleat Al very difficult to watch. I had a bit of a smile, of course, but most of the fun came from the music videos (which I have on DVD) and the rest was basically filling. It could be said that this was not the biggest video success of Al (that honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt this could ever make the jump to DVD, so if you are an ultra-hardcore fan and you MUST own everything, buy the tape from eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.
