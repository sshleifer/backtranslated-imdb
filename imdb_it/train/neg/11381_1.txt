Now, I like science fiction cartoons. However, when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada at the end of 2006, I looked at the first one and I was inevitably horrified. The characters are generic and stereotyped (do they really need to make an African-American man wearing tiger-print clothes and speak with a Jamacian accent?) Why are all Asian characters yellow and cross-eyed? and to the chest and constantly complaining?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, coarse and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities, even stabs, to the Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (double names for young people): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Short similarities with "My life as a teenage robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and co. I'm on foot. Not to mention the abundant racial / gender stereotypy. Don't even get me started on the allusions. I will only say that they are hidden and quite dirty. Seriously. Don't even try to watch this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
