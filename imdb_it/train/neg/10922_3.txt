Worse than the evaluation that was given. This is a typical science fiction movie nowadays: bad or bad acting, poorly written script and poor direction. From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the opening scenes this film has Moses (who was Charlton Heston in the film DeMille), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) looking out on a boy who buries a box in the sand. The characters that were supposed to represent the three icons above were horrible and had to look like the people who were supposedly "supposed to". The fact that this is in the desert far from civilization is exhilarating when someone is injured and everyone is screaming for an ambulance. Obviously the writer is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was deeply disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to make a film of such low quality.
