... may seem far-fetched .... but there was indeed a true life story ... of a man who had a relationship with a woman, who discovered where he and his new wife were ... and he killed his wife, making it look like a rape murder ....... <br /> <br /> in his illusion, he had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him ... so he quit his job in Wisconsin ... and I moved to Minnesota .......... <br /> <br /> the last time I heard he was in a mental institution, the security prison .. . <br /> <br /> she still wore "the engagement ring". that she bought for herself ... and told everyone she bought it for her. <br /> <br /> Events took place in a small Wisconsin town ,,,,,,, and the murder happened in Minnesota ...... <br /> <br /> C ' it was also a story in "People" magazine ... Spring 1988, I mean on page 39. I remember this while I was in college at the time, and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the security hospital. ...
