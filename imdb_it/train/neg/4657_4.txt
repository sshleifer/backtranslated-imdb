Remakes (and sequels) have been a staple of the cinema since the beginning of the media. However it is almost an adventure. If you take what is good about the original and build on it and update the current standards too much, you can succeed. Note, films like THE THIEF OF BAGDAD (1924/1940) or KING KONG (1933/2005) have succeeded in their attempts. Others like KING KONG (1976) fail miserably. <br /> <br /> BRIEF ENCOUNTER (1945) is the model of this film. It's perfect as it could be done on such a subject and we value it IMDb ********** Ten. The story is simple, Love, found innocently by chance and tragically lost. Because, it just happened for the two (2) principles involved at the wrong time. These are portrayed convincingly and sensitively by TREVOR HOWARD and CECILIA JOHNSON. Neither are they conventionally conducting Star material, but quality actors. Watch the movie for details. <br /> <br /> What went wrong now? At T.V. Movie, rebuilt practically scene by scene with names actors RICHARD BURTON and SOPHIA LOREN should have at least scored IMDb ****** Six. Both actors, however, seem disinterested, they merely show their watches and take their checks. Nor are they involved with their characters or each other. You don't think you're in love or when they finally separate it, it's a big loss for both. This should not be and that is why it fails in its intent. Sometimes it's better to leave things alone.
