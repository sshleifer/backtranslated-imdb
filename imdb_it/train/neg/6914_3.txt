I've seen this movie for a while now (while working on a trailer for the film production company) and it was TERRIBLE. Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins telephones his performance (but still blows Hewitt away in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me: you should avoid this movie like the plague if it ever gets released. It seems to go on forever while the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It is inexorably little fun, the cinematography is disgusting and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin should go to film school if he intends to direct again. In terms of acting, his character is totally unlikely, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is pretty funny and the surprising trick of the jury near the end of the film is nice, but this movie is just awful.
