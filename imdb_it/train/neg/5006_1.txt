Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only dislike each other to the point of hating, but have almost no ransom to make a * public * sympathetic or empathetic with any of the characters. There are such bad films that are good (a film by Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter), and there is simply ugly (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This film is barely tolerable even if you are a talented MSTie refractor (for example, Mystery Science Theater 3000). Fortunately, while I'm quite talented (it's like my mind works All The Time), for those who are not so naturally talented in MSTie riffs, in the end you * would * just want to get your head out, painfully aware of the movie " Taboo "robs you of about an hour and twenty minutes that you never come back. Even my MSTie talents were hardly one with this waste of slow and boring time. The most disconcerting aspect of this film is that * someone * lit up the green and / or financed ... I rented "Taboo" exclusively for the usual talent of Amber Benson, who clearly must have been blackmailed into doing this movie. I have another of his lesser known films in my rental queue, the reviews I would read earlier. Ironically the best aspect of the film was its impressive labyrinthine abode due to its internal location.
