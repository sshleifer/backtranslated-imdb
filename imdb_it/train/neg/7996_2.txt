Is there a book called "How to make a film with every 'man against nature' imaginable Clich√©"? Otherwise, ants would be an excellent source of material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants do not have a shred of originality to find anywhere in its 100-minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually lengthened the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the scenes of death and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times ?? and in most cases, much better. It is incredible that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they are practically all the same film. <br /> <br /> And can someone please tell me what in God's name, Myrna Loy is doing in this movie monkey? A talented and classy woman like Loy deserved better than Ants as one of her final films.
