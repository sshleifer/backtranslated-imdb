Kid found as a child in the garbage and raised in a martial arts academy, he has a talent for sinking baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he arrives at the college and is promoted to the championship while looking for his real parents. The infinitely better action comedy is a real casino as a whole. He seems to be striving for a basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is fired, his attention wandering over a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking "What am I looking at". I looked at it from beginning to end and still don't know what the hell happened. It's a shame because there are some great action scenes, some funny jokes and the occasional moment, but nothing, nothing that ever comes together, I'd take a step.
