This was a terrible film. There was no trace whatsoever. To top it all off, when they couldn't explain blood and blood (the only good part) ... they threw in a few aliens! I hate it when the directors (or anything else) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens! Watch this movie, if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you. Two things: how could Vinny say "welcome" when he didn't have a language? It is a pity that Mr. Jones did not play a more important role. The second thing that annoyed me, because we showed bubbles of Vinny Jones and he cut them and put them in blue liquid, so these no longer have any role. Why not? I don't like to be shown something and this has nothing to do with the plot. In short. Bad story I wouldn't waste my time, I would rather have looked at Mirrors.
