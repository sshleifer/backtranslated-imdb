All you need to know about this film is in the first five minutes: it looks good, has a solid, reflective original soundtrack from the late 1960s, and almost all of its characters are unlikely. Once you receive this message, you can also switch to another movie. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Davies ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. Then, when he takes his advice to join her in the real world - instead of experiencing a fantasy film of which he is the imaginary director - he does it by pushing it aside and associating himself with an actress he idealized beyond reason. A few laughs and some artistic reflections are the only things worth looking at here. <br /> <br /> The film is also interesting as a record of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. At Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying dexterity was something to be overcome, but here is the only quality of his character. Schwartzman's family connection has clearly brought him into this role; this is hoping that his choices will improve.
