with this attempt of the ABC family of the famous "cheaper than the dozen" success comes an enormous quantity of banal dialogues, shallow plot lines and poor returns. With about two good actors among the many who want to be, this film was a great disappointment. He is a Hollywood idol of an already ugly plot. So, since they needed many actors, this meant that they would probably be more forgiving. So the acting wasn't five-star. The plot moved quite quickly, and the turns were bad and they had horrible timing. Even the conjunction of the characters and the "final reports" were too soft and clich√© for me. Save yourself and rent something better.
