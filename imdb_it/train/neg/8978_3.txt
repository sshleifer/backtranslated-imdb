If John Waters had written and directed "House of 1000 Corpses" after being hit repeatedly on the head with a heavy object, the result would probably have been something like "The Blood Shed". It's a little fun for the first half hour, but then it slides into a sort of shapeless glop of screams and people doing things together with the genitals with electric carving knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in what he is doing in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it won't take long for most viewers to forget about it.
