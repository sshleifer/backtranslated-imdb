I didn't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a film as bad as his stinkbomb "Mitchell", but this succeeds. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it if you are a fan of Joe Don Baker VERY better job. But, if you like watching fat boys sweat and really, really pulled out gunfights, you'll love this movie.
