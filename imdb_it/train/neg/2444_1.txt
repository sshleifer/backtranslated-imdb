Two houses, a street, a telephone box, a car, a girl next door, a boy next door and a zombie. This list of ingredients should be enough for a great horror movie. All you need is a little blue light, ambient music and ... done. But not in the hands of the Dutch director van Rouveroy! <br /> <br /> I like to organize "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is really simple: take some alcohol, take some movie-loving friends and immerse yourself in the worst movie theater you can offer. For such an evening this peace of dirt is one of the best. Ride guaranteed! <br /> <br /> The bizarre thing is that van Rouveroy is still defending his film as if it were a great achievement. To witness this, you will need to listen to the DVD commentary track. Again: unbeliever and guaranteed laughter!
