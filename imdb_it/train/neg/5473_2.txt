I've never seen one of these original SciFi's before, this was the first one. I think it's fair to judge acting, directing / production, stage design and even CGI effects on other SciFi films. Comparing it to your typical Hollywood production is unfair. I will say, however, that the overall Aztec Rex did not exactly remember Werner Herzog Aguirre's masterpiece, Wrath of God. <br /> <br /> I will begin by observing that, yes, I recognize the fact that this film has more to do with cultural confrontation than with dinosaurs. Despite being a science fiction movie made for TV, there is a context behind the story that I will examine. The symbolic elements included are quite obvious. <br /> <br /> As a result, as a student of history, theology, mythology and film: I found the dialogue scandalous and the theme of the plot to be somewhat offensive. I'm not asking for any mea culpa on behalf of the producers, as I said before the film is what it is. But what worries me is that many of the young demographers for this film probably rely on television to provide them with their lessons when it comes to history and cultural diversity. <br /> <br /> The main problem manifests itself more visibly with the Ayacoatl character (not a commentary on the performance of Dichen Lachman, but simply how his character was written, though, I will say he has work from do before receiving some mention of the Emmy). It is through his character that the actions of Spanish Europeans are justified. Its function in the film as the love interest of Rios states that the European way is the right path, simply because they are Europeans. There really is no other reason given. In reality it is only the assumption that the viewer is bound to associate with Europeans beyond the Aztec because their dress, language, ideology, etc. is more familiar to them than the Aztec - so therefore the Aztecs are portrayed as contradictory and back .' And it is not simply that the observer is left to that hypothesis because of the ethnocentric perception on the part of the viewers, but it really seems that the story is trying to convince the viewer - as if the Aztec was not able to draw up a plan - if not a better one - to lure a dinosaur up to its death on a bed of punji sticks. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, there is a sub-group of Spaniards who are depicted as temple looters and merely intent on mistreating the native Mesoamericans. There is also a scene in which we have the Christian holy man who observes the conquests of the Aztecs: "They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc." - But in the end it is still the Aztec warrior who is portrayed as the main antagonist of the film, even on the "lizards of thunder" (we'll talk about it later). His portrait is insidious, twofold and attempts to send European romantic Spanish by tricking him into consuming mind-altering hallucinogenic mushrooms - an important spiritual component for certain aspects and religions of the native Meso and North America (again, more on this later ) so that he can keep the woman he feels belongs to him and away from Spanish. <br /> <br /> Now analyzing the true nature of the story (leaving the obvious Christian and pagan themes off the table) from a symbolic point of view - a spectator can easily take these so-called thunder lizards as representatives of the ideology / Mesoamerican theology, which in this film is depicted as an intent: thirst for blood, ruthlessness, cruelty, wickedness, perhaps even evil? In opposition, we have this group of Christian wanderers, led by a young Hernando Cortes who are portrayed as naive, but on the whole nobles, lambs caught in the dark pagan world of the Aztecs. Furthermore, the name of the film is Aztec Rex, which leads to believe that it is dinosaurs out to eat people. However, what Aztec Rex translates to is Aztec King, a head of the Aztec state or in this state. (So, because the movie title has been changed). So who, in effect, do we see as the new Aztec king in the end? It is the remaining Spanish, Rios. Aztec Rex is in reference to the new European ideology that has overcome, through diseases, bloodshed, war and famine, Native Americans. Rios symbolizes the European ideal - as the presenters of this film would like them to be remembered (as opposed to Cortes representing "practical, yet still noble" Europe). But when you examine the Holocausts of the Americas, let's be honest: don't the symbolic components of the history of this film do it backwards? <br /> <br /> I have to say that Aztec Rex is at worst a racist, or being kind, ignorant at most. <br /> <br /> And yes, I know it's just a movie, everything wanted to be fun, I understand it, but did we end up with the idea that Rios was the father of the last remaining Aztec lines? I wonder what the Native MesoAmericans should have thought of this ending ... for me, I thought it was a little too self-indulgent. <br /> <br /> The film's best support performances go to Ian Ziering's wig - albeit a showy one - has at least changed Ziering's appearance enough not to think I was watching the 90210 yuppie that brings a group of conquerors in the heart of darkness. Ziering actually shows himself to be a more than capable actor in this film, actually I bought his performance, or at least I forgot that it was still Ian Ziering. I don't know who his agent is, but he should get more work. <br /> <br /> In closing, it was also a pleasure to see Jim McGee again. I've always been a fan since it was too short, stealing his performances in the 1988 film Scrooged. <br /> <br /> Alexander Quaresma - DeusExMachina529@aol.com
