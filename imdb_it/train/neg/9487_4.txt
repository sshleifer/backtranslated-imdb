The cast, although nothing special, does a good job, the plot seems like a good idea, the script is bearable and the end has a pretty good turn; so what's wrong? <br /> <br /> To start with the special effects are really bad (if this was done in the 60s) it might seem OK but in 2003 there is no excuse for such poor images like this. It makes me laugh that the DVD cover is very proud of "the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers". <br /> <br /> Secondly, the direction is weak, this film does not capture the essence of the story, a doctor feeding the inmates of the Devil's hospital (or demonic type creature) should be tense or frightening; it just isn't. <br /> <br /> All in all this is a rather poor film, and although it is bearable and sometimes pleasantly amusing, it is probably even better to leave it alone. <br /> <br /> A rather sad 4/10
