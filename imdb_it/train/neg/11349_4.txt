Actually, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3D animated film. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Didn't Bug's Life do it too? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I say before they go and use the logo. Furthermore, Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it as a movie, because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The film was nice, at least the little flies were. I liked IQ. I agree with the animator, they did a divine job to make a film with something that is just an adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
