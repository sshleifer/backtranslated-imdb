Ridiculous horror film about a rich man (John Carradine) who dies and leaves everything to his four children, and his servants must be divided equally. A condition: they have to spend a week on his estate to get the money. And if any of them die, the others get more. Guess what will happen next .... <br /> <br /> I saw a new print of this film on cable. The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful. It's about all the positive things I can say about it. <br /> <br /> We list only some of the problems that this film has: the killer is screaming obvious; the servants are called Igor and Elga - dai! some of the sound recordings were so bad that I could not decipher the dialogue (no big loss I'm sure); the blood was scarce and very badly made; the other murders were simply boring, stupid or impossible and this film contains a truly abominable acting - so bad that you look incredulous at the screen. Even the professional Jeff Morrow was terrible! The only fairly good acting was the troupe Faith Domergue (who deserved better) and John Carradine (who seems painfully old and frail here). I have to admit though - the final line of this film is a gem! <br /> <br /> Because this was renamed "Legacy of Blood" is beyond me - there's another 1978 horror movie with that name! <br /> <br /> Whatever its name, it's a bad movie. To be avoided at all costs.
