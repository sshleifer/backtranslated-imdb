This is one of the worst cases of film drivel I've seen in a long time. It's so terrible, I'm not sure where to start, or even if it's worth it. The plot is the real problem, and I'm sorry for "Sly", as he plays a decent performance on his part. But that plot ... Oh dear oh dear. In particular, I love the way it finally manages to come up from the foot of a mountain to the top, while the helicopter is on its way. A climb of a day or two takes all five minutes! I could go on: but it's not worth it. Apart from the grim opening (that even a five-year-old would be able to predict the outcome), the rest is drastic. Sorry folks, but this is as serious as filmmaking is.
