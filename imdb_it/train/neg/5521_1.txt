I just came from seeing this movie and decided to see what the others thought. It remains for me to wonder if these people who give brilliant reviews have seen the same movie! This is potentially a good story, but fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a nice dive for the fishing scenes. The characters weren't well developed and the plot skips so much that I found myself asking the question "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry among the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during filming. It was clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but they didn't engage in their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save your money for something worthwhile !
