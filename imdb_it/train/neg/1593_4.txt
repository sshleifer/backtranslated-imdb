Many of the protagonists of the 1969 Hideo Gosha film "Hitokiri" (murderer, "Tenchu" - punishment of the sky) were real historical figures ("western"): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenokoji . The name "Hitokiri", a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who carried out numerous murders of key figures in the Tokugawa Shogunate government in the mid-1800s under the orders of Takechi, the leader of the "Loyalist" (ie ultra -nationalist, pro-emperor) faction of the Tosa clan. What was it? Sad to say, you won't find out in this film. "Brilliant History Lesson" indeed! <br /> <br /> No, Gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody cuts and cuts and (absurdly) the inner torment of the not-so-brilliant murderer Izo Okada than in revealing the current story. For example, Sakamoto was someone of historical importance, considered the father of the Japanese Imperial Navy. The closest Gosha comes to provide a history lesson is the scene where Sakamoto, whom Takechi considers a traitor to the loyalist cause, arrives at Takechi's villa to try to influence him ideologically. He begins by talking about the international political situation, with foreign warships in Japanese ports and a Japan that is too weak to defend itself militarily. Want to know more? Sorry. Gosha interrupts this potentially fascinating conference in mid-sentence (!). Just to inform his audience of a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film left me in total confusion about the goals of the two sides in this fight. For the two and a half centuries that the Shogunate held central power in Japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change, preserving the feudal relations of society. He was afraid of external contamination, both ideological and technological. In line with this spirit, he outlawed firearms, those "leveling" instruments in Europe and the Americas, with which a farmer could have resisted a samurai. During this time, the Emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead. <br /> <br /> But in the cities, which were located in neutral zones among the feudal fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landowners and artisans was developing - - the class known in Europe with its French name, the bourgeoisie. Inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it bothered against the many borders of feudal society. As in Europe, the king (emperor) became the central figure in the struggle of the bourgeoisie for power against the feudal aristocracy. But political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves. When the outside world came with a bang in 1853, in the form of "Black Ships" by Admiral Perry, the ruling elite of Japan was thrown into a crisis. Their army could not compete with these foreigners. Moreover, they had heard of the devastation that British and French imperialists were unleashing in China. What should Japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? Surprisingly, some elements of the usually isolationist shogunate were inclined to open trade with foreigners to get some of their advanced technologies. This is the point of view represented (only barely) in Sakamoto's film. On the other hand, the emperor's loyal ultranationalists, represented by Takechi, believed that they could hold off foreigners by force, if only they could prevent the other faction from "selling out the country". (Sounds familiar?) So the assassination of the key figures of the Shogunate is in order - and we go away. <br /> <br /> Takechi's motivations were, for me, the biggest enigma in the film. Gosha suggests that he is fighting primarily for his personal advancement rather than for the loyalist cause. Can we take this to represent the tenor of loyalists as a whole? (Interested?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers have compared this film favorably with "Goyokin", which Gosha did in the same year. But, where "Goyokin" is a crackling yarn, full of suspense and adventure, with a hero worthy of understanding, "Hitokiri" is struggling, far from compelling and lacking in such a hero. Sakamoto could have been the hero of this film, but we are not allowed to know him - or what he represents - well enough to allow him to achieve this status. <br /> <br /> In view of his wonderful scores for five previous Kurosawa movies, the Masaru Sato soundtrack here was very disappointing, sounding like something rejected by an episode of "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
