** Can contain Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> A guy with a suit looking for an aftershave (the same one used in KING KONG VS. GODZILLA in 1962) supplies many of the laffs in this monstrous flick monster. Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time. The evil vampire is called Dr. Who ?? - funny, it doesn't look like Peter Cushing! Kong finally defeats him with the pride and joy of Who, a giant robotic monkey that looks like a bad metal sculpture by Magilla Gorilla. Like many of the Honda films, this may have had some merit before the American public played and added new footage to it. Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess. They would have to follow higher-level children's programs like The Little Drummer Boy.
