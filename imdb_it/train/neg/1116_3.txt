This film seems to have been a training exercise for the Coppola family. Does not seem to know whether to be a western "A" or "B". I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd has to shoot in his grave. <br /> <br /> All Western "B" cliches are here. The hero with the two pearly guns in the white hat with the trusty steed ("C'mon Thunder"), the bad black with a black beard, the heroine in difficulty, the breeder in difficulty, the coward sheriff, over the top bad guys etc. <br /> <br /> Acting, with few exceptions, is closely linked to the acting school of Yakima Canutt. Chris Lybbert (who?) Like the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) As the villain it seems he would have been more comfortable in a quickie than in the 1930s Poverty Row. The addition to the cast of veteran artists Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but he is not given enough to do to save this. <br /> <br /> What was the point Framing Sequences by Martin Sheen / Robert Carradine? Do we have to believe that the character Sheen was a ghost? What was the purpose of black gloves? It didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of westerns of all genres, I tried to find some positive qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings seemed very authentic. Apart from the hero and the main villain, the other characters seemed authentic. <br /> <br /> If the producers were going to resurrect the character of Hopalong Cassidy, they could have thought of portraying it as it was originally written - a grizzled ranch hand with a dirty mouth and a splinter on the shoulder, the kind of part where Lee Marvin would have excelled. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, but ... to Thunder, in big.
