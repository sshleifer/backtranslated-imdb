Take: <br /> <br /> 1. a famous game <br /> <br /> 2. a director who now has ideas of his own using <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theatrical production of the show mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. a leading actor - who has no feelings for the part he is playing And you will have: "Hamlet, Prinz von DÃ¤nemark" <br / > <br /> I listened to the radio game of "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I were so disappointed. I was hoping that the filmed version would be better, that Schell would have at least some body language to underline what he is saying - nothing. Then the set ... minimalist design is not all tastes, but I usually like it when there's enough on stage to make it clear what the setting is and nothing else. Alas, he is on a stage, in a theater. It will not work in a movie based on a game that actually has credible settings. That the idea for the set was copied from the theatrical production in which Schell was already playing Hamlet ... let's say if it was the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell can get the part of Hamlet somewhere first place and how someone could allow him to play Hamlet a second time. If you have the chance to see one of about sixty films based on "Hamlet", don't look at this unless you are masochist, or really hardcore, or want to make fun of non-talented actors.
