LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing film. I saw the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was very nice, but this really bored you and disappointed ........................... .. .......... <br /> <br /> This film really wastes time and money. I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and they both get bored in the cinema .......................... ... ......................... <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this film. I think SANJAY-DUTT reduces the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ........................ <br /> <br /> The character of the film is also not well defined as the previous one. This film shows the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> Also the ideas of MAHATMA are not defined and confused ..... ......... .... <br /> <br /> A VERY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
