Yes, I voted this movie as a horrible star. Still, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies from now on. This is really so bad that it's fine. This is another production by K. Gordon Murray (read: buy a really cheap / bad Mexican movie, spend money to zero for having nicknamed it in English and release it in kiddie matin√©es in the mid-60s.) I came across life so late as I'm sure some "mood enhancers" would make this experience even better. I'm not going to take back what many of the other reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the Devil, a mechanical reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors I've ever seen. I'm going to make it work on return holidays with "A Christmas Carol" by Kelsey Grammar. Truly a holiday experience made in hell. Now, if I can find "To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)" on DVD, I will have a triple function that cannot be beaten. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I dare you not to touch the fast forward button, especially on the two dance choreographies! This thing smells like an expensive blue cheese: guess you have to get over the smell to enjoy the experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
