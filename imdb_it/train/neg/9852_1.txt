Discovery Channel / Animal Planet must be ashamed of itself. This fantasy is modeled on the "Walking with Dinosuars" series. Although this fantasy is 100%, it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way. Even mixing fantasy dragons with T-rex and extinction of dinosaurs. Added to being shown on an educational channel instead of saying Sci-Fi gives an air of factual authenticity to this show. <br /> <br /> In itself the show is about 7.5 / 10 for entertainment. But the way it is presented I have to give it a 1/10. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the fantasy, but the way they put it is wrong. I can really see slow kids and adults believing they've found a dragon and that this is real. I also think this weakens the "Walking with Dinosuari" series because now you have to see it thinking about how much fantasy is on that mini series.
