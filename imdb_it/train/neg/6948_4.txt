An interesting idea (four African American women crushed under the heel of the company take their revenge by stealing banks) is ruined by the horrible direction of F. Gary Gray and a harrowing script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments . Instead of giving an explicit comment on the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men mistreat them and brutally humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to strike their unsuspecting public with the highcrow notions of the operatic tragedy. It's the melodrama at worst. Gray has his actors who linger on every tired line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to resume the game, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the astonished faces of the performers. And I'm amused, even if actors like Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have a raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a safer hand than Gray's for drive them and consequently come out as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. To avoid.
