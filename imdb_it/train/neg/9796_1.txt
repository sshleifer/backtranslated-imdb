Ok, I CANNOT seriously think of anything worse than the PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But seriously, Power Rangers has GOT to be at the bottom of this list. Can you think of something more stupid than five or six teenagers (who don't even behave like a normal teenager) who dance in identical clothes WITH DIFFERENT COLORS SO YOU CAN TELL THEM? Fan, have you ever met a real person who is thrown against a mental wall and stands up almost immediately and continues to fight without getting hurt? The Power Rangers are for five-year-olds, and believe me, I never liked this show even when I was five. I imagine we can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. The guys actually act like teenagers, and Tommy Oliver actually behaves like a mentor, or not, a teacher. He has a youthful humor, even if the fight is lame, I don't hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many say the Power Rangers are crap, but I wouldn't. It would be a loathsome insult. So deal with it, five-year-old boys, the Power Rangers are rubbish.
