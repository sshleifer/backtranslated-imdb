The film portrays the unsolved problems of France with its colonial legacy in West Africa (Francophone) through the confused and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (who symbolically represents her nation). It is an often engaging and inspiring portrait of a young woman's desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past, in particular, and a nation's desire to reach out to the other 'who once' owned and shaped. This is reflected in the way it focuses entirely on the notion of traveling (or being in transit) from the present to the past; he reminded the realities of undeniable contemporary political and economic current events. <br /> <br /> The characters all have a symbolic role, although limited and unconvincing. France, seen as a visual and totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves us indifferent to its difficult situation as it still seems imbued with the same ingenuity that it enjoyed as a child - in reality, as a child, she seems more in possession of her reality. The rest of the group of rags is simply forgettable. Black Africans are, to say the least, offensive Impressionist portraits of former colonized peoples now colonized by the director's scarce management of his material. They are nothing but a dark and dying background against which exquisite France seeks wonders in search of a world that it has never known, and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon.
