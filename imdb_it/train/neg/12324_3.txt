This was a rip-off of the same rubbish we had to watch Bob Saget during the half hour before. Dave Coulier just thought it was fun and it was more or less the same show as the funniest videos in America, except for one host with a combined IQ of three. Tawny Kitaen must really need the money and Coulier had to go to the basket for his jokes. It was quite tortuous to have to watch him imitate Popeye and other washed cartoons start at Full House. That guy who played all the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be the recipient of a fool of grade A. Coulier must have needed money to please Alannis Morisette while they were going out together.
