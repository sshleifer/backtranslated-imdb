Since many horror films are based on the premise that one or more central characters do something stupid during the proceedings, the girls in this film collect gold, silver and bronze at an Olympic ceremony at the Darwin Awards. A mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they, and would have screamed much less as he did so. <br /> <br /> If you like films with a grainy image, the deliberately amateur work with the camera (my 92-year-old grandmother wields a camera with better results), an extremely poor sound and no visible plot / narrative, so this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women whining for no reason. In fact, reason and logic do not appear much in this film. For example: "we have to find Stephanie" "Yes, I can't believe I was talking to her, like, last night" "Did she call you last night?" "Yes, he wanted to talk about an appointment he asked a" "WHAT? Why didn't he tell me?" As in, our friend is chased by a serial killer with a rifle and a series of macabre weapons but I have a problem with the fact that he didn't tell me he was about to leave. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the budget is low. This does not mean that you have to make it seem that they cost half the budget. The "score" is interesting because everyone, except one, was written and interpreted by the film's authors / directors. Actually it would seem that the entire budget was spent sampling a track of The Duskfall, a Swedish death metal band. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing about the whole film is the ending that starts us with the possibility of a sequel.
