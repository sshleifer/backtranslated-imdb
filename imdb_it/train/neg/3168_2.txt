I had to close this operation after about 15 execrable minutes. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it could improve, <br /> <br /> What I saw was poorly interpreted, directed and written. <Br /> <br /> This film should never have been published directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The protagonist, who is a bride on the summit of HELL, has a huge fall in the ice sculpture that kills her. He was such a disgusting person that I didn't mind for her either. He stops there in a kind of paradise, and he was still repulsive, I left a little later. <br /> <br /> Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope to never see her again, she can't even act. It's just annoying. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd, an actor who normally can't go wrong, was also in this dud. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teenager) is also present, <br /> <br /> I like comedies BUT not stupid about fools. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
