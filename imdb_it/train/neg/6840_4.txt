Although this release is not up to its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My favorite, immediately after having devastated a block with his "Videodisc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear throws from his left eye, we know at that point that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer cannot help but be drawn into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previous flat effect was just a facade. Absolute brilliance !!! The sex scenes show a good balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Later, I felt I had a good knowledge of how Magnavision Videodisc Player works. It is a pity that they have not produced them for over 25 years.
