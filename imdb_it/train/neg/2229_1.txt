Perhaps this is not right, because I did it only in the middle of the film. One of the few films I haven't been able to see because of the lameness. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible, the work with the camera is terrible, the plot is ridiculous and the whole film is simply unrealistic and poor. For example - during a coca cola affair, the coke is kept in a briefcase - I'm not an expert, but I think people usually put it in a bag. <br /> <br /> They use the same silly sound effect every time a punch is thrown (it's the "creaking" sound of the top) and they use toy guns with dubbed sound effects. <br /> <br /> The worst movie ever.
