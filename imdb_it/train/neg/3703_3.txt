I didn't expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I didn't expect the film to be so bad. Chris Rock is not showing a good action here, you can't get the feeling that his character is real, I think the film would have been a little better if it was dramatic or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the film and more best humor was involved. The film is as if the directors had a bad hangover doing it. In the "making of" they don't show a single smile. This is a bad movie! I gave three out of ten because of the few smiles he gave me, but I never laughed!
