Disappointing action movie with an interesting premise: a young mafia assassin (Chandler) must prove to his boss that he is a good man for the service, so he goes to California to take lessons with a well-known professional murderer (Beluschi). First and most important task: killing a young woman (Lee) is completely strange for all of them. But is she an easy target? The film continues and is based on this main idea, but the result is just a bad routine; even the strange turn at the end does not save the film. Good performance by Chandler. I give this a 4 (four).
