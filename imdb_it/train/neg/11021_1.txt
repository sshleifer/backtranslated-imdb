Hallam Foe tells the story of a boy who lost his mother and later lived a sort of Oedepus complex. <br /> <br /> It's something like 95 minutes, but it would be better in ten. There is an hour in the middle where he is practicing climbing on the roofs, and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo (only he is much less likable). <br /> <br /> There is a strange love story involved that doesn't do. I have nothing to do with anything. You seem to look like your mother, yes and then? We know he misses his mother, here are the first ten minutes. They should simply put together the beginning and the end and it would be an O.K. short film. Now it's a portrait of a character that doesn't change. He's a guy who something happens to. The only active choice in the middle of the film is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> There is this whole Oedepus story going on that should let us analyze his character. He paints his face, dresses in women's clothes and wears a Badger badger on his head. A rate! You must see the ending! He returns to his home with the badger in his head (and is shot as a sticky horror film) to kill his father's new wife (with whom he had sex in the beginning). And somehow they thought it wouldn't be funny enough, so they put punk indie music in the background. I have to admit though, I'm a little allergic to movies that want to write a psychological complex about your nose. It seems that this director / boy from MacKenzie / anything is trying to show us that he too studied psychology at school. You are so smart! Thank you for bringing back all these forgotten theories in our memories! You really dug! What Wallraff! Okay, now I understand that this movie is based on a random book, but anyway .. <br /> <br /> Photowise is boring. Lots of talking heads. Furthermore the editor has changed colors from one scene to another, you know cold and hot, etc. Why? perhaps "Hallam Foe" is both a feature and a test film for color blind people. Or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn't be enough to tell us that they feel lonely, so they turned blue so they really understood it. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to comment on the cliché indie-oh-how-how-how-cute designs they did in the presentation. And all the "pretty" sex stuff going on. This entire film is an independent cliché. But I recommend it. I laughed more than a couple of times. Although it is really annoying to be a film student and see how to get away with it.
