** HERE BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Summary: Mia (Helin) is returning home from the capital Stockholm to the rural Rättvik to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. She is by far the youngest daughter and has two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petrén). Eivor has a family and still lives in Rättvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a city. Mia is still single and concentrates on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise everywhere as they face each other and everyone has personal problems that they have difficulty managing. As the party continues (and alcohol is consumed), more and more secrets are revealed and more and more conflicts are born ... <br /> <br /> Comments: To be the work of a new writer / director it was disappointing to see this film to follow exactly the same tracks that the oldest Swedish comedy / drama has followed for years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor based only on characters who make fun of themselves. 2) Pain and 3) Anxiety. This move focuses on the last, almost forgetting the first point while the film goes on. No loss though, since the humor that exists is not fun. The cast shows are good, I think, even if they get lost behind all the anxieties and soon forget. I hoped there were new ideas and influences, but there were none. To conclude, there are better ways to pass the time than to watch this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
