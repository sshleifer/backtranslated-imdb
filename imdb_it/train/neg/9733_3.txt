Rather poor Firestarter clone that looks more like a bad TV movie than a bad movie. How disappointing it is for this to come from Hooper and Dourif! <br /> <br /> Government contractors make a human experiment with a hydrogen bomb. The boy born from the experiment couple constantly has a 100-degree fever, and when he is an adult, people in his life start to burn spontaneously. Try to find out why. <br /> <br /> Completely burned people are well done, but when they get to the point that they are well made in another sense, they have obviously changed into dummies. When the jets of fire shoot from the arms of the characters, it seems silly rather than alarming as it should be. Also ridiculous is the fire that evidently travels through telephone lines and bursts into huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. How exactly should this happen? <br /> <br /> Something else that seemed stupid to me about the movie is when a character has the visions of his last parents. We will later see exactly the same shots as those visions in the films of origin.
