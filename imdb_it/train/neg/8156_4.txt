Prom Night 2 is a horror movie OK, but prom night is definitely better and this movie about how the prom Queen Mary Lou in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and returns after 30 years for revenge. The best actor in this film is Michael Ironside and the film features other OK actors and actresses like Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good-blooded scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl who's trying to hide in her nearby locker by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students is at the computer and Mary Lou shoots him to death. All this is an OK / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
