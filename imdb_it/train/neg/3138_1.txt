I see people writing about how good this movie is. It was horrible! The acting was at most comparable. He made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; because it sank, what many people's minds were going through; maybe even a little conspiracy. Does anyone realize that some people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't do it because all you see is a rich girl who falls in love with a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that blatant trivial at least make you understand that the film was stupid?). <br /> <br /> I cried during a scene, though. The scene when they showed the water filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I think this film made all this money and couldn't even make water look real from the ocean? incredible ... <br /> <br /> Ohhh the band played while the ship sank .. Simply ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor passed it in the "Nothing to do with reality" department.
