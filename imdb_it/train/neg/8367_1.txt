This piece of shit, since I can't call it a movie, can be summarized as follows. <br /> <br /> -Stereotypical black criminal with black dwarf partner in trouble -Nero Midget pretends to be a child with a fully developed adult face, body hair and genitals - The black dwarf is exchanged (somehow) by man and woman who happens to want a child - black dwarf who continues to commit acts of physical and sexual violence, belittle whites wherever he sees them, and commit more crimes - Happy Ending <br /> <br /> Honestly, it could have been be a good satire if it had not been directed so superficially and had such talentless bastards as protagonists.
