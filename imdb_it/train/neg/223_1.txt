Not a "film woman" but a film for the band. One of the worst movies ever made by a male director. Director Andy McKay simply doesn't know the woman. Bad taste peaks, humorous American Pie style, raw story, no sense, story without foundation, characters refuted. Vulgar fantasies have come to life on the screen. Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how did the three good actresses get involved.
