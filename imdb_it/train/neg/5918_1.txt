Carl Panzram lived an incredible life and scrawled his memoirs on scraps of paper for perhaps the only person who ever did something uninterested for him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, released the best part of a century after Panzram's death, provides the historical background to a first generation American account of running away from home to go to the west and be a cowboy, get caught up, thrown into the boy's house, repeatedly get away and thrown into prison repeatedly to be tortured and sodomized. While Panzram grew enormously and strongly, he sought revenge for the wrong he had done while traveling in South America, Europe and Africa, and it didn't matter which people he raped, robbed or killed because we are all equally worthless. <br /> <br /> This film projects James Woods as thin as the rough, bad neck, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who in the film is a "drunk", excessively dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film does not develop anything special about this world-trapped career prisoner (like robbing former President Taft or being released from the Oregon jail as long as he gave his word to return). In short, I don't think Carl would be too happy.
