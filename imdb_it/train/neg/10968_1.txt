*** THIS CONTAINS MANY, MANY SPOILERS, NOT THAT IT CONTENTS, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS SO PATENTED OBVIOUS *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well, here it is, this is the first time I've come home from a movie and I said "I have to go to IMDb and write a review of this NOW. It's my civic duty". Such is the wickedness of this film. <br /> <br /> * digression start * But let me tell you something before we start. I'm not a bit of a Harvard-art-major-film-noir-weenie (in fact, I went to college at the other end of Massachusetts Avenue, in Cambridge, the one where smart people without rich fathers and trust funds go, which should put me exactly in the nerd-chi-would-love-obsessively-love-comic-book census group, and I still hated this movie ...). My display preference is for the highbrow movie that includes Die Hard, Bond Flicks, Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never sunk, not so much for the lives lost, but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that manure of a movie. And the one and only reason I will watch a haughty French art film is if there is a young Emmanuelle Beart, often undressed. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of his precious 10 seconds here on IMDb, for God's sake. So I'm just as superficial as them, so I'm not criticizing this film because I'm looking for a standard of film excellence - it's because Elektra smells like a dead goat of three weeks. * end digression * <br /> <br /> OK, there is so much nastiness here that I have to try to categorize it. Here it is: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons why a male would like to see this movie is to see a lot of JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted to do it). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo", the latter was the sexiest movie. Do you know the red dress he advertised wearing in every ad you saw? You see it inside TWICE - once at the beginning, once at the end. Bummer. In the rest, she looks like what Morrissey would look like if she were a girl - lots of pouty and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible range of expressions that JGar shows in his acting, ranging from "pouting" to "pouting and crying". Oh my God, you'd think she had to go out with Ben Affleck or something as horrible as that. Hey, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAD GUYS / GAL: Show the same range of expressions and acting skills you would expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least close to JGar's performance, it doesn't stand out too badly. The role of a guy is to be there and be huge, another is to stand there and have things come out of him, and the role of the woman is to stand there and breathe and / or kiss people. They manage to pull off these incredible feats. The main villain has the most difficult role of all - must SIMULTANEOUS a) appear angry and b) appear Asian. Do a good job at this. I think there was a fifth villain, but my brain is starting to block parts of this film for self defense. <br /> <br /> TWISTS! This film has more surprises than a speech at the Democratic National Convention. Put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the United States for six months and speaks only a little English - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's pad, and I swear to God I'm not making up : "She goes home to kill a girl and even a father". And this is BEFORE THE FATHER WAS ALSO OPENED ON THE SCREEN. Now my wife is not stupid, but she is not even courted by the Mensa for her gifts, and has had no exposure to Daredevil or the genre of the comics. And he understood it in. 00015 seconds without stimulants and without preliminary information. Such is the obvious obviousness of this film. <br /> <br /> STRICT FIRST-SIMPLE STUPIDITY! OK, so there's this great guy in the movie. He can take a gunshot and blow the blow away like a lint, and he can take a fierce stab of Electra on his chest and bend the metal (or melt - or something - other defenses that break, thank God). But does JG jump in the head and he explodes? A bite of Achilles? OK! Such is the astonishing stupidity of this film. <br /> <br /> Ack. I'm starting to feel a brain hemorrhage, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you have to intentionally cut your tires to keep you from seeing this movie, WE DO. And if Armageddon arrives, let it be> before <it comes out on DVD.
