At the beginning we will see the beginning of a secret council of some kind. It all looks very promising from the start. With some supernatural elements, the mystery becomes more interesting by the minute. The main character who looks like a good guy gets into trouble because of his demand for money to which he is entitled (temptation) and other factors. You really like the guy and you want to know exactly what's going on. Normally a person in his situation would have different options. Somehow he doesn't have those options. In this film there seems to be only one solution even when it's clear that it's not his fault. Suddenly he meets people who talk about church, prayer and God. And they provide the answer to his problem. It should be obvious at one point in the film what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always useful. But it was really necessary to mask this message. This religious element actually ruined the visual experience for me. While the message is good, its simplicity cannot escape the fact that in real life it is more necessary that you solve problems presented in this film. The mystery presented to us is never solved. Instead, you are forced to tackle another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. The actor, once brilliant, is adequate, but if you look closely you will see that he is not at all serious. He must really be desperate for money. Otherwise, what would an actor of his caliber do to play in a film like this.
