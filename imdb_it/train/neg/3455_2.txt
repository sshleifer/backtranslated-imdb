Damn! This is one of those movies that you think you've already reviewed, but you didn't. I mean, you didn't give a damn about it, but somehow it came to mind. <br /> <br /> Be honest and short; this is one of the worst, boring and stupid floggers ever made. I can't say anything good about this piece of shit because there are barely decent sequences that could say they are made by professional directors. <br /> <br /> The scenes of death are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good considering that it has copied "Popcorn" since 1991. <br /> <br /> To make things even worse, this is not such a bad movie that is good. It's just ugly. <br /> <br /> Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't enough.
