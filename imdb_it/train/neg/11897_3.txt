William Lustig's sequel to "Maniac" conclusively demonstrates that, without the spectacular effects of Tom Savini and the convincing performance of Spinell, "Maniac" would never have become the cult hit he did. "Vigilante" is poorly directed, with a simple script that says it all for you and is predictable at every corner, and also the mediocre performances of all the actors. Judging by the sense of "deja vu" that this film gave me, Lustig had seen "Death Wish" many times too many times before doing it! (* 1/2)
