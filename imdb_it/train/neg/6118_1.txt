This is not an excellent story of the Tarzan epic. There was only one reason for this movie. John Derek wanted to show his beautiful wife in the buff! Bo Derek in "10" was at least a humorous film and there was a reason for nudity and sex. This film is nothing but soft porn. If you like it, well, then move forward quickly and skip the rest! This film (like Bolero) was again a vehicle for Bo Derek to show his terrible acting. She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but one of her posters is more exciting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better actor than this; this was one of his few mistakes! don't waste your time with this movie ... go buy the book.
