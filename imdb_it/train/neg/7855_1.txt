I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this movie. Neither blood nor violence makes sense. Unlike other scary movies that have made sense and meaning, this film is just blood, blood and killing one after another. This film is not at all interesting, it has no significant plot or plot, nor does it have an intelligence. The blood seems very fake and this film, on the whole, is useless. Don't waste your time with it either. It's just an hour or two of senseless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary but simply disgusting. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen on all the horror movies I've ever seen.
