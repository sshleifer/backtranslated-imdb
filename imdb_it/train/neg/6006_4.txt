I didn't agree with any of the theories of the Left Behind series, but nevertheless I found the books compelling and I read 8 of them 12. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. However, I didn't have very high expectations for the film. There was no way that most of Hollywood would take a Christian series and produce a big-budget film. So it was done independently ... and I felt like I was watching a really long TV show. Simply don't FEEL like a movie; he didn't have that "experience" of the film, if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the film suffered because of this, and the low budget, poor special effects were another deduction for me. Also, I hear that Gordon Currie was sadly annoyed like Nicolie Carpathia. Reading the book, my impression of NC was that he should have been a charming, charming, incredibly handsome boy who spoke English with almost zero accent traces. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found a Clay Aiken pencil neck that looks like an employee of Best Buy a month and gave him a really bad fake accent. So I lost some stars for me right there. A film is not convincing when the main villain does not have the appearance or sound of his behavior. <br /> <br /> The acting was ok, but nothing to write home about. Some scenes - like one of the conversion scenes (I don't remember which one) - they were real squadrons of places for me. And part of Christian rock music or whatever it was, it was really out of place for some scenes, like the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't do it for me. Stick to the book, folks, it's much better.
