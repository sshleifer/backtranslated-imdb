I can't believe this movie was ever created. I think the director is trying to make it an artistic piece, but that just makes it worse. It seems that the zombies have applied too many eye tricks. Zombies are only in the film for a few minutes. Finally, there are perhaps five or six zombies in total, certainly not a nation. The best part of the film, if there is one, is certainly the titles because the painful experience has finally been completed. Once again to repeat other users' comments, voodoo priestesses are strange and don't make much sense throughout the film. Also, there is a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl that makes no sense. It has never been explained
