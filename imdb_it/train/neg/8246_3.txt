Dad's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some fantastic news at the local post office, unaware of being persecuted by the thief Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, Father David Miles receives a message (from the young Robert Harron) that he requires Dad to go home; so, when young women come back, can they be ?? home alone. While the vulnerable couple lie down for the evening, the "Grand Ball of the Black and Tans" club gets underway; and, a dark-skinned drinker announces a further danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic pair ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his best roles in Biograph, stealing the movie from "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced buddies at the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West are suggestive of the later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are too affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, since the story of a redeemed thief saving his potential victims from greater danger is intriguing. <br /> <br /> *** The Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
