As a cast member, I was a member of the band in all basketball games, I would like to let the world know after being in the film, that we haven't been allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon. This is due to the producers and the director who broke the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. It looks like the U of O sign was shown. While we were shooting, they allowed us to eat several meals with the cast and production staff. Mr Nicholson was memorable for being one of the most rude men I've ever met. A lot of time for a 20 year old. It is not certain how the life of the campus was in the late 60s and early 70s, despite what Hollywood might think. Trombone from Oregon
