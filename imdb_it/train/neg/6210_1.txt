This is the worst movie I've seen from "I Know Who Killed Me" with Lindsey Lohan. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can assure you that you are expecting nothing but frustration and disappointment if you choose to go and see this. Hey, Tim Burton, I was your big fan ... did you even show this movie? I mean seriously, that f% # k? <br /> <br /> Without giving up anything, here is the story in a vague nutshell ... Nine wakes up, does things, his actions and decisions are irrelevant. .. and the film ends. Oh wait ... here's a spoiler ... <br /> <br /> spoiler warning! Spoiler warning! At the end of the film ... it's raining. I think part of my soul died while watching this movie.
