I looked for a copy of The Forest because I was watching a special VH1, I think "Where Are They Now", and I saw the videotape flash across the screen during a segment of actor Corky Pigeon. He played the ghost of a male child in this horrible B horror, but I remember him from his character Freddy in the Silver Spoons television program. This film is a big disappointment. There is nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish. I kept stopping him in boredom, putting him aside and forgetting me, then tripping over it and trying once again to get over it. Obviously, the angle of this film that was destined to distinguish it from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And of course, here, this doesn't work. I can't stand male contacts. I kept expecting them to look at their palms during longer dialogue scenes to read the cheat lines. The situation at the beginning where couples decide to go camping separately is uncomfortable and trivial. I imagine the only positive thing to say about this is the scene where the boy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. The gore makeup is good enough there. Dude, I'm really reaching a positive hour, eh. The only other non-budget horror movie on a level as negative as this would be Home Sweet Home.
