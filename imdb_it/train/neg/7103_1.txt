This is the best way to describe this film centered on a married couple who moves into a house haunted by her husband's first wife, who died in mysterious circumstances. Sounds good and well, but what comes out is an hour of pure boredom. In fact, one of the funny things about this movie is that at the beginning of the film there is a warning that promises a free coffin to anyone who dies of fear. Well, trust me, no one has ever taken them to that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls, peacocks, bizarre gardeners and slammed doors. And the music is the worst, it consists of a constant tuba music that sounds like it's played from a sixth grade. And you will discover the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to ask yourself what people thought in this movie. Someone dies while running and hits the head and the police are never called to investigate. Yes, in the end this is a slow pace (which is really bad considering the film is just over an hour), a small boring story, which is easily understood by the average person. Apparently none of the characters in this film was the average person.
