SLO SPOILERS (but it doesn't matter anyway). <br /> <br /> An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions that is not even worthy of the 10 lines that I need to put these observations on the net. This is the only worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the deceased treatment of the Mystery Science Theater. Even if it took me half an hour to realize the ironic angle expected, it was still a terrible mess. Its only value lies in the perspective that forces us to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks, the genre is only successful when classic cinematographic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are used. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is not a master. Period. And no trivial analysis of easy social commentary here will change that. Strangely, Carpenter has never been anything more than a director B, but at least films like "Fog" and "The Thing" had a terrifying atmosphere (the latter being one of my cult favorites). <br /> <br /> Abominable acting. Camera corners stuck in the cement. Tension-less rhythm Yet perhaps the most hateful element of the episode is the plot that, of course, JC cannot really be blamed (unless the writers were Cody's companions). The first two minutes of a girl going through a forest just to be nearly run over by a would be Scully-Mulder's pair is the first and last thing that works in the movie. But let's go, a girl whizzing through a desert forest to nowhere, in particular, in desperate need of an abortion that happens to coincide with the fender of a couple of doctors for women's rights whose clinic is at the end of the road around the corner. Oh, and I won't even nap about how the doctor jumps the accuser in the car and accelerates from 0 to 60 in six seconds. It works wonders for broken ribs or a concussion. <br /> <br /> Then things disintegrate very quickly. The empty dialogue "I just want to help you", the endless slow back and forth at the gate, great battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of mobile phones?) Followed by the clashes: one more the director of the Ramboesca clinic against Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen looking for some football during the Easter break. Another beautiful phrase: "So, what will we do?" from the boy who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Um, no, it's not pheasant season yet. So who needs those teenage boys anyway. What about the good old tried and true method of the lonely lunatic making his way through the gate with his all-American SUV? <br /> <br /> Regarding the exchange of bullet scenes, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comic strip. All that was missing was the Wham, Bam and Whiz of the ballooning titles. And all on a soundtrack worthy of an episode of Mannix. <br /> <br /> At some point we learn that Dad is not really the father, but at this point we were not led to worry much more or both. The only source of the drama of this story is the conflict between the pro-life father and the pregnant daughter, who is just thankful that she doesn't have twins. Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, in which they were ever found together. They remain mere abstractions for each other. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the gatekeeper, every single character is absolutely unpleasant. Bland, hysterical, obtuse, macho. Perfectly flat as the human background can be. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And there is that quarrelsome dad who slips into his pregnant daughter as if he were the stressed out boy. Fortunately he took his. There are two fantastic comic moments of MST: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing goes out and then the newborn lobster with a glue on the baby's head. The belly of Angelica's rugby ball was also pretty before she finally shot the little monster from hell to life. As for that daring scene of male abortions ... well, they should have kept the Miike episode and banished this instead. <br /> <br /> In short, a third version of Rosemary's Baby meets Alien in the field of an M.A.S.H. episode. Only this stinker, appreciable only for today's permissive under-16 generation, will ensure as someone else has said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. A pity, given that there have been many brilliant productions, including really decent splits like Dante's "Homecoming" or McKee's deliciously eccentric "Sick Girl". Not to mention the superb images of "Fairhaired Child" by Malone. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry John Carpenter, I think your directing days are over. It is time to apply to the President.
