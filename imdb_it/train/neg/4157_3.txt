The above seemed a much more appropriate title when I and my suicide followers decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit <br /> <br /> Erotic, Scary, Suspenseful, Ben thought, these are all the things that this film does not manages to be. <br /> <br /> It's still incredibly fun, the slow sound effects and the ugly dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I've seen in recent years. Yet this film does not even try to be funny and this is one of the great cinematic successes, it becomes a comedy without even trying to amuse. <br /> <br /> In the film an old boy who looks incredibly Santa Claus goes around plowing the zombies and destroying the vampires in the ground. Did that make me fail to believe in the title of the movie, if they were vampires vs zombies because vampires and zombies weren't fighting? Oh well whatever, plus there were more flaws in this rental than the title. Like this; there has been a virus crossing America creating zombie beings that go around acting a lot like your average tourist. Yet there are only four zombies in the whole film. Another problem is beyond a store where it is deserted. Surely you would see zombies running around in the woods or in the background a little. In fact, I think they simply ventured into a circle of woods over and over again since they didn't have enough budget to film in a larger place, or that the director didn't want to waste his precious time to shoot in different areas of wood that he would have to occupy sitting in a trailer to masturbate to be disturbed by such trivial matters. <br /> <br /> The director actually had so much fun doing what he didn't have enough time to hire a fairly large cast or even an editor. And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress like different people and try not to behave inconspicuously, while I assume he changed his name and started cutting movies at random "editing is not hard work, anyway ? " The only reason this "movie" found its way into our bag was because we somehow got confused with Freddy vs Jason, strange how these things happen, isn't it? And the only way we did it at night was by wearing gas masks and fixing them to our skulls to avoid the stench of this sickening mess. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, we laughed at the end, but I'm sure it does a lot when he lost his sanity ...................
