The mixture happens. Susannah Yorke is a young and luminous Jane Eyre, and her interpretation is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester should be 35 years old. George C. Scott with white hair looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. Jane's dead uncle is in better shape! He creaks and growls, hateful and grim. It looks like an ax-killer who sent his ax to be sharpened; we are not surprised that he keeps a wife in a cage in the attic! The great love story seems a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful and charming when he chooses to be. He has a beautiful speaking and singing voice, a good mind and a conscience that tries unsuccessfully to repress.
