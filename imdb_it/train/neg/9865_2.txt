I took this film in the hope that it would be similar to the hilarious "The Gamers" by Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommendable, anyway). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but fails to provide. The reason is partly rigid acting, but above all writing and directing. True, it can be fun to use every single clich√© on role-playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene you will know what the "joke" will talk about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is described in an exaggerated way. There is no subtlety in this film, if there were captions "LAUGH NOW" or a trace of fake 80s-style laughter, it wouldn't make much difference. With some scenes you can't help but think "Yes, I understand why they thought it would be fun" but the way it is run takes all the momentum out of the possible joke.
