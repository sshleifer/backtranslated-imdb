This film has the core of a really good story. The work of men and women of the Coast Guard, especially in the North Pacific, is the stuff of heroes and legends. This film brings together a good story with three endings (none satisfactory), a couple of fights between useless and useless bartenders and two alleged "romantic" relationships that have the same spark of fire as a dead camp. The rescue scenes are fantastic - even if the computer generation is uncomplicated and the scenarios are rather unreal - but the background is lame and disappointing. Costner is good - especially his acting hand (watch out for this). Ashton Kutcher is flat but it's not terrible. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best female is one of the Coast Guard guards in the rescue center and is in the car for about two minutes in the entire movie. It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs it!
