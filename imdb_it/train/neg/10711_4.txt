The Minion speaks of ... well, a servant. A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. It is a kind of demon that has human beings and when the body dies it will have another. Anyone who is possessed will suffer a berserker rage. Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas, a member of a secret order of the Templars, who has the task of keeping the key away from the servant. The film begins a thousand years ago, in the Middle East, where a pair of Knights Templars flee from the servant. Then he dances forward until 1999, where the key winds somewhere in the underground of New York. An archaeologist is in charge of studying / digging in the place where the key was found. Needless to say, the follower is behind the key, and the film becomes a long chase between the minion and Lukas and the archaeologist. <br /> <br /> The film is just that, a low budget B movie. The film lacks energy, and only walks ahead. You will follow the chase but you will never feel involved in the story that intentionally takes the ideas from the previous films (especially the Terminator movies). Fighting scenes with the follower are annoying, as you never get the feeling of how good or evil a warrior this demon is. He "skillfully" becomes an army of one man when he fights a team of Templars but sucks when it comes to one on one. And it should be around for a long time. All this shows that any sense of logic is simply thrown down the drain for convenience. The whole idea of ​​a secret order of the Templars, a door to hell, and the key is not well explained. We simply have to accept that they exist only. The film seems to have been made with the feeling that there is not much potential for the story, but just enough to make some money. Dolph Lundgren looks like he wishes him to be somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 2 out of 5 stars.
