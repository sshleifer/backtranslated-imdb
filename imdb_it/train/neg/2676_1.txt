** Possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This straight-to-video mess combines a cannon-armed heroine, Z-level effects, Nazis, a mummy and endless lesbian sequences and is still boring; the 45-minute video playing time seems ALWAYS like Eternity. The only good part is one of the out-the-blooper, in which the villains force a 400-pound egyptologist into a chair - and the foot of a villain almost crushes under a chair leg. Take this snoozer to the video store and watch the tennis court, bowling or tennis instead.
