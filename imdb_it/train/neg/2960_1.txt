This is, without a doubt, the only worst film ever created. There is no discussion here. This is. End of the story. The story is youthful and sub-nun, it seems to have been created by a three-year-old boy fascinated by dinosaurs. The whole concept is simply stupid. It is inconceivable how anyone can come up with something so stupid and think it's funny. Even the jokes are completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious about how bad this movie is, please don't let me describe it. Words cannot express how terrible this film is. This is not just as bad as in a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not the entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its evil level by 5,000, and you're not yet close to how awful this movie is. Having given Pokemon the film a point, giving this film a point seems to be nothing short of charitable. It's so bad. Did the producers and directors even take film lessons? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It seems that some amateurs with a paint thinner have made this film. If you have rented this, please take it back and request a refund. And don't even think about renting it again.
