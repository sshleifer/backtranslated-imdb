Don't waste your time, let alone pay the rent for this piece of dreck! How it was made is beyond me. (I don't know why there are at least 10 lines ... I have already summarized this trash film, but, oh well ...) The acting was terrible, as if everyone needed lessons. The plot was weak, the ending ... Feh! I think that cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalistically OK. The only good thing is that, if they could make this film, even to earn some money, there could be hope for any writer with a real idea. So, everyone ... take heart! I suppose the same applies to the actors ... if these people were actually paid, then you can do it too!
