I'm surprised this movie is rated so well, even if I had to go with a typical 71 scale it's a c-o, so maybe that's fine, but this film was just a typical thriller if not tediously slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but this seemed to prove it, yet the rap woman put pressure because she didn't want to be questioned in a courtroom, even if she put the man who broke her arm and raped her for life not but also protecting the lawyer for whom she felt feelings and her family not just random people she didn't even know. There were other similar problems with the film that were good if there was some kind of moral to take away from the film, but the few moral questions as if it were right to try to kill / beat Kady before he did something illegal were Presented a small side since Kady ended up being just a madly determined bastard to take revenge so sure that the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since he waited for Kady to rape his daughter so that he could do something legally would be a bit absurd. So now I've just brought more of my life to life for this stupid movie so please don't see it so at least your life won't be alive and this way my 2 1/2 hours or so has meant something.
