This Paramount / ripoff version of OKLAHOMA! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE is not that unusual or innovative. Marketing and introductory comments could be there to save what is really a bad musical western movie shot on a stage and as a live television show. I don't find the use of the cyclorama background, illuminated in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or .... everything that is innovative. As noted, it seems more like a film produced on a television budget: the whole stage, with minimal series supported by cycons turned on! (Compare with the NEW FACES (from 1952). The actors come out pretty well, and this style was made much better when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. For sure, this film suggests the often repeated question: "What were they thinking?"
