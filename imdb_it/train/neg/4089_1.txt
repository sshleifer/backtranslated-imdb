Warning: this review contains a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, "almost". This is nothing but a lot of random scenes tied together in an attempt at a story. The protagonists (you can't call them "heroes") shoot innocent spectators for their food, and even steal it for similar reasons. There is also a lot of homoeroticism, which was a turn for me. (SPOILER: It seems that the evil (which is only topless and not naked as other reviews claim) is killed soon, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of torture to the public.) the abuse occurred numerous times in this film abomination. If you're in the MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. Go instead to rent the original Conan DVD.
