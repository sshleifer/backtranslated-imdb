I really wanted to like this movie, but it was simply impossible. The acting was ultra-hammy, the plot was annoying and the rhythm was SLOW, soo slow. All the while sitting in the cinema I wanted the film to end. Twenty minuets in a movie and I'm praying for a finale. Certainly some of the images were beautiful, but by the boys, I really mean! And for a movie about a boy who tuned magic instruments, there wasn't much music to talk about. The music that was there was annoying and boring. There were also high-pitched and high-pitched sounds at times, even those were annoying. Above all this film managed to bore me, and it scared me at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it's over. I have to go see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste from my mouth.
