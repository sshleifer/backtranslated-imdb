This movie was so delightful that I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It's shot on VIDEO! DO NOT film! I haven't seen things like that since the early 1970s, when nighttime networks showed the film of the week 'horror flicks' shot in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and this is a compliment. Some of the actors give their best. Michael Des Barres agrees with what has been entrusted to him, which means acting like an addict without control. I can't say it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski while the therapist sits on a chair for practically the entire movie, with a very small variation in the camera's corners. I can't criticize her for someone else's poor blockade, but it's absolutely amazing in her role. Her childlike voice works against her here. And I consider myself a fan of Nastassja Kinski. It is ageless and exotic, but it is out of its reach with this. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically agitated. Each line you deliver is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a furious shrew? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet and maligned wife walks away, and probably the most credible of the group. But this is not saying much. <br /> <br /> This must be the worst movie I've seen in years.
