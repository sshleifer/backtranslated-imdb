Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Munchies' is another clone of the Gremlins released in the 1980s. I'm not very fan of imitations. <br /> <br /> First they were the excellent "Gremlins". <br /> <br /> Then the very average "Critters" arrived. <br /> <br /> Let's not forget the bad 'Ghoulies'. <br /> <br /> But complete boxes should go to 'Hobgoblins'. <br /> <br /> Is there anything else ?? <br /> <br /> Now "Munchies" for me should fall somewhere between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". Actually I probably found it more fun than "Ghoulies", but I preferred the darker tone. <br /> <br /> Since its inception it plays its stupid nature (which is better for this), but due to that nature the acting of Hammy (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), can become rather overbearing than you prefer just see the snacks around. Here's where the fun happens. Mostly light heart fluff, since the story focuses mainly on the munchies (who are hungry, horny and destructive) in a lot of alleged comedy encounters (some moments work) in the small desert town while a couple of people are at 'Chase. It's silly, but strangely addictive thanks to the lively rhythm. The creatures themselves are rather dull and not very detailed, since they are basic dolls that are thrown around. Where their personalities come from is that they can actually talk ... and with attitude. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and a spirited Nadine Van der Velde (who was in "Critters") were real protagonists. Harvey Korman was acceptable in two roles. Robert Picardo is also displayed. <br /> <br /> Fun for the non-demanding.
