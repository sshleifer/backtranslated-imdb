... and in * in no way * as clean, logical and understandable as in the photo in that pathetic sum of tired Hollywood clichés. <br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and have spent 16 years of my life struggling through delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. As the main character in the film, I was successful mainly because of logic: because I kept thinking all the time to keep the illusion away from reality and to know what was really going on and what was not. In the end, I was very successful because of the drugs, by the way, but I certainly escaped the madness because I knew before taking the medicines the difference between what was real and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I feel empowered to tell you that this movie is a total scam. Not only does he cheat the story of the main character (who was not faithful to his wife, who was bisexual - something really important here), but above all, he shows a comforting and domesticated view of schizophrenia - that the point is completely missing. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a mental structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not * a "normal man with an illness", he is someone who from the first visions and feels things differently from most people: for him, things like time, space and personalities of people they are not solid things. He feels that he can be bent, he can change, he can change and perhaps even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich and very imaginative inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but is trapped in it because he cannot relate to most people, and his world becomes increasingly poor to the end in an empty, illusory dead end. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is depicted in this ridiculous "healing", tearful film. It should be violently scary. People other than the main character should appear strange, strange and absurd, such as in Lynch's "Eraserhead". There should be * really * awesome, weird, gross hallucinations, because that's what schizophrenia is about. This is not * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, look at "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Dick "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", DO watch "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City", or play "American McGee's Alice" on PC, and you may have a vague idea of ​​how it is. Don't watch the "feel good" movie of the month, with trivial situations, clean characters and stupid images and tricks. "The Cell" is the most accurate film on the mind of a schizophrenic, his visions and his inner coherence - he is violent, strange, confused and very, very scary. <br /> <br /> Once again, Schizophrenia is not about details, it is not a clean, tame trick played to you. It jumps into your face and won't let you go: the walls fall apart, people turn into strange hostile creatures, you feel like you have back in time, you're not sure who you think you are, you feel everything. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, this is much more than what is represented in this soap-like melodrama
