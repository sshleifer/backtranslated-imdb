We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The film was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. Here are my problems with the film. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why exactly did the villain kill the owner of the mine? He is not really connected to the film except to establish how bad it was and to have a hiding place. <br /> <br /> The bank employee gone bad acts too badly to decide convincingly to hire the killers from his employers. At least keep us. No character developed for bank owners or bank employee. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in many things. <br /> <br /> An absurd premise that Martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing his in-laws. Even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff. even more ridiculous that Martin hangs his hanging rope and rope the sheriff brings him under the threat of a gun to finally return to his town and save his wife from the bad bank clerk. Wouldn't he just come back after the band's quick dispatch to save his wife and arrest the bad guy from the bank? Just send the judge a note that the gang confessed before being killed on the track ???? !!! Overall, very sad and meaningless acting at the film.
