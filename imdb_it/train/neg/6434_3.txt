I'm always amazed at how different all the people are and how for almost all the films you get both extremes. The people who think it's the best film and the people who think it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Stigmata wouldn't be the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's up there. First of all the sound. The producers spent more time on the soundtrack than on the editing. He was so strong when the soundtrack was playing and nobody was talking and then when Patrica spoke in her monotonous voice, she couldn't be heard. <br /> <br /> I usually like Patrica and Gaberial, but they were both flat in this movie. Patrica basically had 3 emotions. Quiet, with great pain, or really angry, he has the stigmata. The first was the predominant, the second involved the screaming pain, the third involved his voice. It was the volume that distinguished the three and not the emotions. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed a lot of the deep meaning and subplots that everyone was talking about, or maybe I was distracted by the terrible shooting and MTV style. When you watch a 3-minute video, you need quick cuts and slow movements to convey a short story, in a 2-hour movie, it's sickening. I can't see the meaning of her seeing that women go through the steet and make a child fall. And no Pittsburg doesn't rain that often !! <br /> <br /> I think that perhaps a true story, with something to say, could have been intended, but the whole budget was spent on buying music and slow rain equipment to drop and renting that gorgeous apartment in which Mrs. Arquett lived that ended up firing the boy with the story.
