What do the Americans have and their leveling with the religious gobbledy-gook? To think that this was a bestselling novel is incredible, but to make it a movie you really need a good acting and a script that you offer. In this case, all the good actors went to heaven and we stayed with Kirk Cameron as a CNN journalist (!) Trying to find out why many people simply disappeared. Oh yes, there is a subplot on a conspiracy and a famine of the evil world, or something like that. The good news is that this is done so cheaply, and with such senseless dialogue, that it has pure entertainment value in all its unintended laughter. Not recommended for anyone with a 3-digit IQ.
