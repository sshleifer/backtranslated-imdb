I bought this film for 1 euro, not knowing what it was. I thought "hmmm, a movie called mutilation man must be if not very funny at least full of blood". It wasn't fun, that's fine. It was disturbing. Very disturbing. And I don't mind disturbing the movies, but that didn't mean anything, except that child abuse is not a good thing to do. hmmm ... The image quality was terrible. Acting ... there was no acting. Only one fcker pushed up for more than 90 minutes. This is probably a material for the cold blood jurisdiction of sicko. <br /> <br /> Don't look at this. It's not worth your time. It's just awful. I wish I'd never bought this. <br /> <br /> They should mutilate the guy who did this
