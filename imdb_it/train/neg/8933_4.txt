Watching this last night amazed me that Fox spent so much money and had so little back on their investment. It is the kind of disaster that must be seen to be believed. <br /> <br /> I am sure that on the first morning of Raquel Welch's filming he dusted off the shelf on his fireplace to prepare a place for the Oscar he would surely win for this boldly original film. Ops. This is not what happened. <br /> <br /> The infighting on the set was detailed in the Rex Reed print and this helped the film acquire a reputation even before it was released. When it was finally released there were not the usual three circular advertising circuses. If I remember correctly, in Houston it opened in drive-ins and neighborhood theaters and never played any of the great clubs. <br /> <br /> I blamed most of the blame on director Michael Sarne, who was very hot after directing (not so good) JOANNA, a film with music about young people in London's mod swing. <br /> <br /> If I remember correctly, Fox ended up shooting him and putting the film together the best they could. That's why the scenes take place in no particular sequence and the characters appear and then vanish. An impressive supporting cast (Kathleen Freeman, Jim Backus, John Carradine, Andy Devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do. <br /> <br /> To expand it to feature films there are numerous clips of Fox films with stars like Carmen Miranda (in incredible footage of THE GANG'S ALL HERE) and Laurel and Hardy, who have never dreamed of playing in a movie with X. <br /> <br /> The score of X is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be enjoying themselves. Perhaps someone involved in the film had a distorted puritan sensitivity and thought that if they could make these things unattractive it was not bad to exploit them. <br /> <br /> This was one of the images of "youth" that almost made Hollywood bankruptcy in the 1970s. A writer joked that EASY RIDER (which was made for the change of pocket) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many movies followed that they tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate their success. Sixtyish directors, once honored such as Stanley Kramer and Otto Preminger, have made films such as RPM and SKIDOO in an attempt to attract a young audience. White filmmakers and writers have tried to make films to attract a black audience. Those films are stuck somewhere in a vault and the two names and many others of that kind have never, as best known, been released at home or on video. They are the deep and dark secret of the studios. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Raquel Welch in this is, all in all, very good. With the right direction and script, he could have played the kind of brazen freed women Rosiland Russel and Barbara Stanwyck specialized in. It looks great and has fantastic costumes. Mae West is the most vibrant seventy-time actress I've ever seen. On the one hand, it's a little heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory in the past, but I'm sure she needed money. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a big budget X-rated films of this age look BEYOND THE DOLL VALLEY (also from Fox) because you don't take it seriously. They are crazy children who play with the equipment in an important studio. MYRA BRECKINRIDGE tries to say something. There was no one who wanted to listen.
