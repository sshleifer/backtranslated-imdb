This film often extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify meaningless ideas, corroborated by statements like "we create our reality". <br /> <br /> Sorry, people, reality is what is true for all of us, not just the gullible. <br /> <br /> The idea that "everything is possible" does not stand up to a more thorough examination: if everything is possible, the contrary things are therefore possible and therefore nothing is possible. This leads to a postmodernist absurdity, which is nothing but an attempt to denigrate established truths so that all ideas, founded and stupid, are equal. <br /> <br /> To quote the science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, "Reality is what, when you stop believing, doesn't go away."
