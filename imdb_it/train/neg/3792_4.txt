I have seen many, many productions of The Nutcracker. Now maybe I saw this film from the obscured point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective I found everything, from design to choreography, to be lackluster and unsuitable for a "film". None of the traditionally "weird" and impressive costumes resembled what they should have been (ie the candies didn't look like candy, the rats didn't look like mice but rather like chocolate kisses,) the acting was weak, perhaps too soft for the screen, and the choreography did nothing for me. This makes the whole show very satisfying (at best), as if it were destined not to stand out from other productions. But remember, once again, this is from the artistic point of view of a theater director, not a dancer or a choreographer, but a male theater director.
