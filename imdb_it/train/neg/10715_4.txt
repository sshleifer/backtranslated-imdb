What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the film loses it. In fact, it never really went. There was a bit of excitement when we found out that Angie isn't really pregnant, then find out that she's after all, but she was. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually carries a lot for a film, was terrible and his entire character wasn't even close to being important to this film, except to make it longer. I really wanted to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not try for a pure comedy, which unfortunately wasn't, but maybe a drama with comic elements. I think if the movie did this, it would be a lot of fun since both actresses are pretty funny in their own way and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.
