What is interesting is acting; it wasn't bad, just not enough. It was rather lame, the special effects and the lines were the single culprit of this failure. Standing alone they weren't horribly bad, but putting it together was a tragic move. The show seemed long and tortuous with special effects apparently designed to speed up the film, but it didn't quite work. <br /> <br /> Much of the blame for this disaster has been put into special effects. You won't believe it, they were pretty fantastic. Appleby was not the best choice for this effort. Although it could be all they had to choose from with a bit of fan recognition. An experienced actress would have brought something to the part, as Appleby never did. Scfi puts out some really good original films, it's just a pity that this failed so drastically.
