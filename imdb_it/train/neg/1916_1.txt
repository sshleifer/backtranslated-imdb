This film is totally junk. Some intellectual imbecile who consoles himself by doing his best to claim the superiority of the aristocrat over the working class. Nothing but a catharsis of self-satisfaction. Disgusting. <br /> <br /> If this type of film is set in the United States, it will surely become a big joke. And simply because it comes from the "other side", it becomes a masterpiece, a wonderful fun for some Westerners hidden by the brain and / or who wash their brains (some George W. maybe :). A typical sequel of the cold war, however a kind of joke. <br /> <br /> I would say, if this - as expressed in this film - is all that Soviet intellectuals had thought for all those years, then perhaps they deserve all the miseries they claim to have crossed. BUT NO! Like many others, I have read and observed true masterpieces of real Soviet intellectuals. For example, something relevant even with the dog, "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's film - is a true masterpiece. Real life, real tragedy, true sadness, true pride and dignity, one of the best realities of the Soviet era.
