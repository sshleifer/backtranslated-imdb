I did not expect a film as good as "In The Line of Fire" or an episode of "24", but it seemed that this film was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best. The cast (good) couldn't disguise the fact that the plot was too predictable and the actors had to fight (they really try their best I believe) through their bad screenplay jokes, giving the characters rather flat extras. When I saw the film I had the impression that I had seen most of this in other (better) films. In it there were car chases, great shootings, romance, twists, etc. This film has none. <br /> <br /> ** Spoilers ** As soon as you see another woman talking on the phone with the character of Cuba, you know who is behind all this and all the suggestions that are given to you ("you are too much close to the president, look at it from my point of view .. ") seems silly. <br /> <br /> If it were up to me (and maybe it's a good thing that it isn't), I'd like to rewrite the plot like this: <br /> <br /> The First Lady orders her murder husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks in Cuba all the time.
