I felt that Rancid Aluminum was a complete waste of two hours, the plot was thin and confusing, the prestigious ranks of players had terrible dialogues and extremely questionable accents. The camera work was quite experimental in some places and although you could see what the director was trying to convey, it made it even more difficult to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminum is the excessive use of narration throughout the film, almost as if the whole plot was dictated to the public. The best performances had nothing to do with acting. In fact, probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although it is true that he plays the stereotypical office secretary. DON'T under any circumstances go and see this movie if you don't need a reason to catch up on lost sleep, there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned money.
