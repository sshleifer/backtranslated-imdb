They are showing it on some off-network. It's crap. While it's not as bad as the B-movies that show on Saturday's science fiction network but still a pretty big pile of shit. Acting is acceptable. The plot and the writing are quite below the standards and the pace is too slow. Every minute of the film seems like the part of the film in which things are wrapping up before the end credits - not the apex of the film, the conclusion. Furthermore, large parts of the cast look old to the age group they are playing. Everything is predictable, boring and not worthy of being observed. Save time Don't even take the time to watch it for free.
