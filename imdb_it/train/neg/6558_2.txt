We rented five movies for New Year's weekend and watched this first. All I can say is that there was nowhere to go except after seeing this. It was useless and vulgar. The screenplay by Harvey Keitel must have been easy to write - just make two words out of three every curse. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good at a character, but the film has nothing else to recommend.
