For all his visual delights, how much better the Renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and empty, just like the story and style of this movie. With real actors, perhaps the film world would not have felt so lifeless. There is a lot to admire here, but in the end I discovered that all I could do was admire. I didn't really like the film, and it clarifies something I haven't seen before: that visual elements can be the positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, everything can be for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this film does not come to anything, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love yellow science fiction thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films that I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had his tragic villain and Dark City had its provocative plot. The Renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. I wanted this film to appeal to me more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way. The Renaissance was an historical and artistic burst of color and life. How ironic, therefore, that one of the most desolate and lifeless films I have seen this year takes the title from the Renaissance.
