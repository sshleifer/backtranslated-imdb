I had never seen a Tarzan movie before, when I saw it on TV I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately I have to say that I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 and a little overweight. Not like I would have imagined Tarzan would have looked. And, unless I missed him while I made myself a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling scream. Also missing is Tarzan who swings between the trees - jumps from the vine to the vine. <br /> <br /> Oh well, so much for the expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - The Cheeta monkey was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were bad and good guys and a love story ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing wrong, you understand, but still nothing good. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best film to present Tarzan: 4/10
