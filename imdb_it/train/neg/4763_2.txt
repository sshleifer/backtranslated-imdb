The main reason I wrote this review is that I found this "revision" of a great theatrical movie worthy of 1972, a horrible cinematic experience. If I can save someone from looking at him, I will have done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is loaded with talent, and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh has an ugly, sterile, set of notes. He proceeds to film the film from every corner arty, absent-minded, self-centered as possible. We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close-ups of eyes, minds and so on. The script, by a Nobel Prize winner, introduces long stretches of unpleasant homosexual jokes, which are falsified by both sides, .... I think ?? Given the "twists" character how do I know? The characters themselves, so richly designed in the original, are coarse and unpleasant. The execution time was reduced by an hour, which is the real problem or the kindest thing the director did for us. Actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is remotely credible. Jude Law is over the top of Caine, but as the accredited producer, he must have had Branagh's blessing. <br /> <br /> All in all I found this ugly appearance, an unconvincing shell of an old classic. Why was it made ??? The paying public has spent less than $ 4 million worldwide to see it! A vanity work that fails at every turn.
