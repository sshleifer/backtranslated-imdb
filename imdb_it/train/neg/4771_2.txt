Don't waste your time with this movie. It could have been fine, but the ending was one of the most absurd I've ever seen. I have to seriously ask myself how the people involved in making this film could have watched that final scene and thought "Yes, now there is an ending!" and he patted his back. It seemed more to me like they were running out of ideas! They built the final scenes to have an interesting twist, but instead let all the buildup fall on his face. When the last shot turned black and I heard the credit music I started I was in shock - I couldn't believe what I was seeing and that someone could even call it an ending. The best thing anyone could do with this film is to rewrite the end and give it some substance. Seriously, I'd really like to have anyone approach that in a room, look them in the face and say, WTF ?? !!!!
