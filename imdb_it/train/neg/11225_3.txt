This documentary is a historical re-enactment of the last years of Betty Page's career (Paige Richards). Teasing Tennessee was the most recognizable pin-up queen in history. His most memorable work came in the 1950s and consisted of fetish photos, bondage and "girly flicks" cat fights. Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) on his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera. There was no nudity in the famous photos or "bachelor movie", but nevertheless, Klaw was commissioned to distribute obscene material and was ordered to destroy them to avoid the accusation. It is no surprise that Betty has followed a cult at the height of her career. The girl next door with jet black hair, blue eyes and a figurine dressed in fetish clothing or would not be fascinated for decades. After all, it was said that he was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world, Elvis Presley. Betty Page would disappear and dedicate her last years to religion. In reality this film could have been much better; but good enough to arouse interest. <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is extraordinary in itself. The bra, the panties, the garter and the tube do not damage the image in any way. Still in the cast: Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Keep in mind that this movie can change your heart rate.
