We hope this is the last nightmare. This is the epitome of a bad thing. Ok, there's still some fun, but only in the most mundane sense. Rachel Talalay had been present for the duration of this franchise, had been on the production staff and had also produced. I don't know what he was thinking, but this debacle comes complete with the human video game and a guest appearance on <br /> <br /> Tom and Roseanne Arnold! I wish I had the faintest idea of ​​what he was thinking when he wrote / directed this disappointing piece of trash. He even tried to distract his audience from the fact that this film was nothing but a glorious popcorn movie, instead of looking like horror, with the forced use of a 3D ending. Aren't those elegant glasses? And you have to KEEP THEM! It's the equivalent of, you just spent $ 9.00 making me rich. Here are 10 cents. Now, don't you feel special! Sorry, but for me, it just didn't make me feel special. <br /> <br /> And Freddy has yet another face-lift. This was for the worst, I think. All the artistic beauty that went into his "look" in the previous films has been replaced by a set of prostheses which are obviously cheaper and less detailed. It seems ... less like the burned victim it should be, and more like having a skin disease. Changing the make-up of the protagonist in a series is at the same level as the change of the protagonist actor. But wait! They did it and they did it. So I guess it doesn't matter. But it mattered to me. Freddy is no longer SCARY. It's just ... another low priced monster like the Leprechaun. <br /> <br /> It's more ... a dark comedy than the classic horror that this series promises; full of what one can only hope that the writers thought they were jokes and clever jokes (unfortunately it was not enough for both stories). <br /> <br /> So there's nothing more to say than picking up popcorn and getting ready to laugh, because there hasn't been a scary or suspenseful moment in this whole movie. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 3.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Fiend :.
