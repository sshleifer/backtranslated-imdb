A shabby and useless piece of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Written badly, with inane and wooden dialogues. You don't care if the characters (indeed, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point to the whole thing. Perhaps some of the set and settings will interest - those gaps between the boards of all the buildings could be faithful to the way life was lived. The framework encounter is useless and distracted, and the character Hoppalong Cassidy is both boring and inept.
