I saw the movie last night and really wanted to like it. My expectations for the film had gone up and down since I knew it was going on. Some days I would see something spectacular and on some days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Despite being the kind of fan I am, I had high hopes for this film but I was very disappointed in the end. <br /> <br /> Even though I love Richard Donner's films, I didn't like their sometimes-camping nature or the changes they had made to the Superman character and his powers. <br /> <br /> Singer however chose to take the worst elements of Donner films and put them in his version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker, he is nothing but a shyster, a crook and a common criminal. It's not smarter than when Gene Hackman interpreted it. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but eventually he falls victim to poor writing and insignificant dialogue. <br /> <br /> His henchmen are more two-dimensional than even the comic henchmen. Most of them literally have no dialog box in the film. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms. Tesmacher. He seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor but he proves to be just a subtone that melts after seeing Superman in trouble and betraying Luthor in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the film was Frank Langella Perry White. I wasn't a big fan of Perry White in Donner movies, but at least he had a soul. After all, he was a veteran journalist who cared about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing more than a company puppet. He wants everyone to focus on Superman related stories because they sell documents even if all the other articles are doing the same thing. He doesn't care about real stories, the real mysteries like the blackout and what Lex Luthor is doing now that he's out of jail. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about Langella is that it is DULL! Some actors can be calm and sober and yet have an underground current that lets you know that the still waters are deep. Frank Langella is a puddle. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He's fine, but again there's not a single memorable line in the whole movie. It is not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly designed to look graceful, as even the slightest movement of his fingers influences the way he flies. But it still seems choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane, poorly written, was surprisingly well played by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, again, for a Pulitzer-winning journalist and writer, he is as eloquent as any teenager from Dawson's Creek. James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole film, mainly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without any superpowers he can understand Lois Lane's message, fly on a plane for the position, board the Luthor yacht and save Lois and his son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the film is when I am all the pantry trapped while it is flooded by water and the ship is sinking. You see them slowly going into the water. You know Superman will arrive at the last moment to save them, but you can't help but feel sorry for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Unlike Singer, this is not a superhero movie that returns and tries to find its place in the world. As soon as he returns, the world welcomes him again with open arms. Lois is the only one not happy to see him come back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him the chance to fix the score with the steel man. <br /> <br /> Superman is probably one of the most stupid heroes in the universe. A large piece of green meteorite was stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor was released from prison, he now has knowledge of Superman's powers and weaknesses, yet he is still unable to connect enough points to know that Luthor used Kryptonite against of him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only thing Superman does well is to lift really heavy things. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
