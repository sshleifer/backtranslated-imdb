I desperately want to give this movie at 10 ... I really do it. Some movies, especially horror movies, are so cheap that they are good. A ninja scarecrow wisely in the flesh that can make corn cobs as deadly weapons ... it definitely fits this system from budget to bright. The depth of the film is surely its strong point and the turns and turns it implements, keeping the public on the fringes of their seats actually driving the gruesome ... ninja ... victim of puberty ... pre-30 year old student. .. non-cowboy design ... wise-cracking ... the son of a scarecrow bitch in the spotlight as the most disturbing horror icon of the year. All I can really say is, "you can find it" and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you like this kind of horror horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT THE HELL WERE THEOKOK!? "
