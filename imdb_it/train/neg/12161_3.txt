"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with a couple of twists added to the back half. The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three films of the week. It is yet another warning about succumbing to temptation, and it adds nothing new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who has a fund of considerable security. Even if he has everything, he risks losing everything by creating a fierce affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a doe-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, falls in love with Brett, and doesn't take it particularly well when she gets clean up on her engagement. Shortly after the wedding, Ms. Brett finds herself dead in the master bedroom of the large and luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police demand Brett, he punctually points his finger at Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to become thinner by the minute - not that she was the image of stability before. His defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is determined to prove it. <br /> <br /> Did he do it or not? How will it end? You can find the answers to these questions the next time "The Deadly Look of Love" is aired on your local station. And be sure not to lose the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
