I just want to start by saying that this is the first review of a movie I made online. I felt the need to warn people of this film because it is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interviews with the director he says he respects constructive criticism and so I will try to avoid hitting the film just for the sake of it and offering my opinions on why I found it so catastrophically terrible. <br /> <br /> 1. The actors. I know that the budget couldn't have afforded great actors, but with Nicholson who had worked in the industry for over ten years he certainly knew some actors who were at least average. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly lame make-up and special effects. Once again the budget obviously interfered with what was originally planned, but after working in make-up for so many years there are really no excuses. <br /> <br /> 3. The obvious similarities with the hostel. Although not exactly a rip-off, it certainly tries to cash in on the success of previous films. The only problem is that Roth knew where he was going and exactly how to get there ... <br /> <br /> 4. The music. Not at all disturbing or disturbing, not even annoying, simply annoying. <br /> <br /> 5. The script in general. All the dialogues have been forced and terrible! Even the secondary plots on the theater and the boy entering to save them were weak and almost like an afterthought. <br /> <br /> 6. Assembly. WTF. How jarring, and not in a good way. I said seriously. <br /> <br /> I would seriously like to hear the director's thoughts on my post (he undoubtedly attends his pages on IMDb.) because friend ... what were you thinking. Surely at some point, during filming or editing, you realized what a yolu turkey had in your hands ... Sorry if I don't want to be tough but you have to be more talented than this I hope your next movie gutterballs or wahtever is better, we hope the practice progresses. <br /> <br /> But in the meantime avoid this like the plague. I want my 81 minutes again with interest. (At least I didn't pay to watch it.)
