I haven't seen the first two - only this one called Primal Species in England. I don't think I would worry about looking at them though. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Terrible action, ugly dialogues, low-cost rubber monsters. Everything about it is so ugly. The nicer characters die very quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible idiot. No one like that would have survived five minutes in the army. It lasted for years but I was happy when he finally managed to chew his head - I had nightmares that he would survive. The colonel was disgusting too - all sullen sullen and bottomless screams. And the specky doctor looked and acted like he was out of a porn. I was waiting for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a vampire, but she didn't. Too bad, since he would have animated the endless movie. <br /> <br /> Wasn't Roger Corman used to make decent films once?
