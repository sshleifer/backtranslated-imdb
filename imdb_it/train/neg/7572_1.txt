It seemed to have seen this movie thousands of times before. It was absolutely predictable. Whenever the story tried to get a little distorted, every time I waited for something interesting, I saw nothing but what I expected. Like "The bread factory opened another structure, because there was not enough bread". In two words: Flat story, which has become a clich√©, bad acting, bad special effects ... Only the dumb Russian cop, Vlad, was a little funny while punishing around the bad guys. The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID, that it made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I waste my time spitting on that shame of a movie ... It won't get worse (because it's not possible): D
