I thought it would be a good movie, since I like zombies and horror movies in general. But I didn't think it would be such a piece. The only zombie in the film is at the beginning and is hit by a damn machine !!! The film seems to be written by a porn director and filled with porn actors, I would never call them actors! The costumes seem to be stolen from a local school play. It looks like a road movie with almost no monster. There is nothing funny about this piece of sh! T, just horror, but not in the way the director intended. I'd rather be raped by a pedophile than be seen again !!! ugh!
