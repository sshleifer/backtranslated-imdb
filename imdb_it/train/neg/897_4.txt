Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a small success with his script for this crazy comic vehicle for Henry Winkler, then "The Fonz". A university actor from the 1950s (and an all-out asshole) does a coitus and marries without prospects of employment on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the flaming world of wrestling, eventually becoming a "Gorgeous George" celebrity. Turning the sympathetic Winkler into an unpleasant mess seemed probably an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate it from his television alter ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong and mean, staged rather carelessly by director Carl Reiner. Particularly crude is a jolt that involves Herv√© Villechaize (from "Fantasy Island") making his moves on Polly Holliday ("Alice's" Flo). As loved by Henry, Kim Darby seems a little out of his element - especially when surrounded by all these TV hams - making the romantic aspect of the script irrelevant. * 1/2 from ****
