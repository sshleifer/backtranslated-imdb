- I'd like to start by saying that I understand that the Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of 1950s science fiction films. I understand that none of these should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that it doesn't work. A parody should be fun and this is not. Not once during the entire runtime did I smile. In general, I'm easily entertained, but I couldn't find a snippet of entertainment on Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble from the beginning. The two "stars" make their appearance on the screen with one of the smallest gags imaginable - a water pipe that they can't control that both get wet. These two look like the aspiring Bowery Boys. Because someone would like to mime the act and the Bowery Boys character is beyond me. After the less than illustrious beginning, the film continues with sequences of comic pursuits, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings and other non-amusing assorted pieces. It's all just a complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought it on the double DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. That movie is Academy Award winning stuff compared to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
