If you had made a genre film in the late 1980s, you had practically a 50/50 chance of being set underwater or in a prison (unfortunately we never had an underwater prison film). Framed for murder by the mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right next to the brother of the mafia boss Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems as a rogue (and insane criminal) agent Colonel Burgess (who also unveils John Saxon) is using the prison as a proving ground for a new supervirus. This is the only film that Saxon directed during his legendary career. For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it seems that the only ones he gave any suggestions were the economic or Italian ones. Sure, it's a low budget, but that can't justify the rigged staging, the blunders or the awkward exposure in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon made him slightly bloody and works in a hilarious nude scene (our protagonist falls asleep during a revolt in prison just to fantasize about a scientist). Cole, who looks like a more robust Jan-Michael Vincent, is as decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - showing off a real bad carpet - gives the whole thing like the boss of the crowd of clich√©s. The end takes place in the favorite position of Marty McKee, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia published it on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
