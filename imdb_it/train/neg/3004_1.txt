What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the rhythm was bad, the cinematography was bad, the direction was bad, the "special" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of malice in a slasher, but even the killings were bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, the past event that established the reason for the massacre went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of this and explained what happened quite well. <br /> <br /> So, the victims were invited to the "meeting" in an abandoned school that still had all the utilities activated. One of the victims thought it was a bit strange, but they rejected it and decided to break in anyway. <br /> <br /> Finally, the killings were so fake that they were practically unwatchable. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see a breast and not a very beautiful breast. This film makes the showgirls from Citizen Kane virtually indistinguishable.
