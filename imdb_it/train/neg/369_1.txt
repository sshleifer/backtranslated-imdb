I almost called HBO and asked for my money back for the month just because they broadcast this movie. I can only see the directors of the movie sitting, "Okay, we have to come up with something that is just like Home Alone, we'll just add some money to the child, hire low-fee actors and oh yes, we'd make it a lot less fun! "<br /> <br /> Ok, maybe not the last part, but basically it's what you have here. Not even worth a visit if someone else rents it. And how about children's movies? Forget about it. I wouldn't let my children see it, not necessarily because of bad jokes, but because I wouldn't want them to say, "What were you thinking of showing us that piece of lame garbage, Dad?!?!"
