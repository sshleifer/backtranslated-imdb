This is a science fiction film of formula B, and the director made no mystery. It is a dragon that is restored by a scientific team. All done is stuff you've seen many times before. It's a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it's full of characters and stereotyped situations. The director attacks this fact simply by making it a formidable film, without any attempt to deceive us, and this gives this film a slight charm, but it's not something you'll probably remember for a while. It looks better while you're cooking, cleaning, training. A kind of unreasonable amusement. It has its place in entertainment, but it's certainly not something you sit with friends to watch, unless you're all just drunk and you're not interested. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I don't think he's as lousy as most people, but I'm surprised some people in the posts thought it was spectacular. This really escapes me, as I see no attempt to make this film memorable.
