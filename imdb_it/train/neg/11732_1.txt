IMDb guidelines state that you must state if your comments contain "spoilers". <br /> <br /> well, this whole movie is something of a spoiler ... a warning story that glorifies what it warns of, a story of lost youth that doesn't know where it's going. <br /> <br /> I saw him at the tribeca film festival. this film wasn't just bad, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> the acting is inconsistent, the characters are mostly clich√© with little depth, and the farnsworth acting was particularly bad. <br /> <br /> from the paternalistic accents to the meaningless plot line, to the "graphic" elements out of place, to the repetitive dialogue and to the scenarios ... it has sucked the great. <br /> <br /> I think he was looking for a more angular and up-to-date kind of "pharmacy cowboy" with a touch of "natural born killers", but he's not as delicate towards the characters as the first and not where shocking (outside of some fr-level gore) like the scale. <br /> <br /> more than anything else, someone really had to A) modify the script <br /> <br /> (there are some things to develop in there and clearly <br /> <br /> offers with a worthy subject ... if he is mishandled in his attempt.) B) change the film. if it were reduced to a nucleus, it could be passable. <br /> <br /> I would go lower than 1 if you could ... like maybe zero kelvin.
