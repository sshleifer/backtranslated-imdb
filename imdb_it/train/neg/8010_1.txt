I am very surprised by the positive comments because there were four of us seeing him in a screening and we all went out. We personally thought it was painfully slow to watch and I couldn't sit down for the whole movie. And we really tried to join. In particular, those of the group who really wanted to appreciate it because of their personal experiences with the alienation of sexual orientation in the school years represented did not like or identify with it at all. :( <br /> <br /> That being said, it's nice to see that this film resonates with many people here in the tables and with the reviewers. This is the beauty of the film's subjective art form. :)
