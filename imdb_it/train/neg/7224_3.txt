The film remains in gray for too long. Very little is explained how the film progresses, with a lot of strange sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but due to the way of narration they only become strange and not understandable to watch. It forces you to watch the movie again, but in no way am I going to do it. I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I had seen this movie in the evening I would have fallen asleep. For me the film was like a poor man's "Blade Runner". <br /> <br /> The film leaves too many questions and improbabilities. It makes the film leave a useless and not lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Even the strange aspect of the film doesn't help much. The film is half CGI / halves real life, but it is not halved as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative, such as in later films like "Sin City" and "300". They even created half of the movie's characters via the computer, which seemed like a very useless and strange choice, considering that the animation of the character is not too impressive. Of course, the futuristic environment is still beautiful and the film obviously wasn't cheap, but its style on substance and in this case is not a positive thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also absolutely hideous and uninteresting. The main god of the film constantly says lines like; 'I'm going to do it, but it's not your business because I want to do it. So don't say anything, Mr. Horus! It's irritating and a really easy thing to put into the film if you don't care to explain the plot. Even the deepest questions and meanings of the film merge into the dense plot of the film and its script. <br /> <br /> The actors did their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were certain that what they were doing would be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from the original. It comes up again from many classic and semi-classic science fiction films, mostly modern. Perhaps it is also the reason why the film had a very redundant impression on me. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting film experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
