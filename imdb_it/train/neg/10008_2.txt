The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and obsolete, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a "walker" is or really care about. I felt like I was watching a movie from the 70s. The argument was not credible for the year 2007, even though it was set in Washington. I think this sounded true for everyone who looked at him because the applause was low and fast at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A. <br /> <br /> I don't think Schrader really thought about the movie ahead of time. Many scenes seemed to be cut off as if they were never finished or simply didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to another and you had to try to understand or guess what was happening. I didn't really have Woody's private life or boyfriend (Carter) either. What was it all about "artistic" images of slavery and male torture (from Iraqi prisons)? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt to create this dark private subculture for the character of Woody (Car). It did not work. It didn't even seem to make sense. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) impeccably. You really understood how a "walker" would be (say twenty years ago). He was great and most likely will never be recognized for this. <br /> <br /> As for Lauren, Lily and Kristin ... Boring. <br /> <br /> Don't see it! It's painful! Unless you're a true Harrelson fan.
