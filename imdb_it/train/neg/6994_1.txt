When I went and saw this movie, I had high expectations. But I was wrong. This film was exactly like any other horror movie. It's a virus, zombie, etc. Exactly like Resident Evil and many, many other films. But the difference with this and other films is that the story is very week. They are bad actors and boring music. The photo is OK but the rest is total crap. Don't watch this "horror" movie, go see the Ring 2 or any other movie that is much more than a story. I hope they will stop making horror films that have a virus and the virus will spread and make people zombies. We have seen enough. The only good thing about the film is when they stand on a roof and shoot famous and infected people.
