In the first they were mostly giant rats, but there were also some wasps and a giant chicken. This, however, is only a period of giant rats, giant mice and a really growing boy. This is about this growing boy and a scientist trying to help him, so he accidentally creates giant killer mice ... you know how it is. This film has some kills and its moments, but I find it to be on par with the original, I prefer only a certain variety in my films about giant creatures. Well, that's not true ... I actually like "Empire of the Ants", maybe I don't care for giant rodents. All in all a rather sad film even though it has a rather strange turn in this sequence of dreams that is really bizarre. I can't recommend this.
