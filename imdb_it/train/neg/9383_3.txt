VERY BAD FILM ........ and I mean VERY BAD ... The plot is predictable, and it's VERY mischievous, the creativity of the battle and the dance scenes for the time are the only reason I didn't give the film is only one, apart from this ... this is a film that you can't afford not to watch ..... I hear while watching the movie, the idea behind the film was interesting for a kind of clich√© .. ..bubbing the bumpkins of the countryside to the city, bla bla bla, but I think it could have been at least a little better if it weren't so trivial, very badly portrayed from the idea to the screen, I think. The plot is quite predictable at times, even if the dance I can say AT TIMES, is quite good, the dance twist was good ..... IF you are just watching the movie and watching the dance scenes and composing your dialogue maybe it can be a 5 ... lol
