Hi, can anyone hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you are a viewing partner of this film: join the fan club! This film was so incredibly bad that I couldn't stop laughing when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's ugly in a nice way. Here you can see all the clich√©s invented for a horror movie. I'm afraid it's very difficult to get a copy of this film, but it should be in the top 10 of the worst movies ever made.
