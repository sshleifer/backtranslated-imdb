"Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally inept and amateur attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror film. Apparently, almost twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring overly enthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. This is a typical production of Troma, which means in other words, there is a lot of boring and totally irrelevant stuffing footage to accompany the absurd plot. Is there a bit of random gore and free nudity on display ?? that is not bad ?? but it's all so very useless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to watch. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so desperate that it even uses many shots twice, such as the circle it has seen killed. The inconsistent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addict and the international Charlie Manson, Paul. One of Paul's low-level disciples, named Igor, becomes a little too obsessed with Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually leads the whole cult to descend further into the criminal madness. Just to illustrate with a small example exactly how crazy Igor is: he rips the heart directly from the chest of a really sexy hitchhiking girl! There is an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some really bad and embarrassing pseudo-artistic tricks, such as slow motion footage and hallucinatory dream sequences. Perhaps there is a sequence that more or less qualifies as useful for garbage fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera keeps the blade in the bloody stomach for fifteen full seconds.
