Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are all in great shape here. They deserve the Oscar nominations for their performances. I'm a big fan of the TV show. Their music oscillates and they are all so talented! I am also a great exponent of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> IF YOU ARE A WHOLE S CLUB DO NOT READ THIS !!!!! <br /> <br /> The performances are terribly weak, the dialogue is terrible and the lines are not even performed correctly (I'm sorry for the director). The jokes are so incredible that 8 passionate little S Club fans weren't laughing. They thought they could do it better. And they did it. They have conquered the world. They have become S Club Junior. Paul, "the fat, ugly who started a group of mosh" must thank his lucky stars that he left when he did. One of the worst movies ever made. ATTENTION TO THIS MOVIE! DO NOT GO AND SEE IT! DON'T SEE! You will cry! 0/10 RJT
