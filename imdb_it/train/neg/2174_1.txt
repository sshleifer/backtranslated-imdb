It's hard to believe that people actually love this dreck! I think children can have fun, but for me it's the kind of children's movie that parents can't stand to sit. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and perhaps the worst actor of all time. I will give the director some responsibility for the child, but it was really painful to watch. Now I feel embarrassed for her, because people know it was her. When he sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn off the sound, so I came here and found out they did it because he won Star Search. I always thought that Jim Belushi should be ashamed to exchange the name of his wonderful, sadly missed brother, and this crap shows why. Zero stars
