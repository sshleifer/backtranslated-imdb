Anyone who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue to the plot, should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg don't arrive until Q brings the Enterprise into the Gamma sector, the Klingons NEVER see each other until Kirk meets them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to bear the Enterprise name .... I have need to go on? Berman and Pilliar have made fun of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After his death, they only saw $$$$ and went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett has been in every single Star Trek episode up until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved in this mess. Poor Bakula He's a great actor, as is the whole cast. I like them all, but the plot is tragic and ignores all the previous ones in the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched Deep Space 9 (which was canceled prematurely).
