This film introduces a series of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so. None of them generates any positive interest or response. I waited for the intrigue to start, hoping things would improve and end up attacking until the end, but there was no reward for doing so. <br /> <br /> If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. For me the action is not worth telling. Not that the story was so bad, I guess we could say that I had some problems with the script - me. I thought it smelly. A look at the credits will show you that there is a pretty strong cast here, used unnecessarily. Most old professionals in this film do a good job; of the actors I hadn't seen long before I particularly liked Deborah Kara Unger. This is all I can find nice to say about this image.
