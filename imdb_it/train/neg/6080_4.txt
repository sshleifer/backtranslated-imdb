'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its protagonists of the children, the forest and the discovery of the ruins of a castle. Yet in essence, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence that uses the not-too-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio who struggles with his threatening bloodhound, the film describes Laura's psychological persecution, the girl who promised her love for him and his eventual love story with the equally malevolent Sylvia. The psychological complexities of the film give value to the film, yet there is no doubt that the film is uselessly exploited in its representation of nudity and sex. The appearance of the film is based more on its wonderful settings than on the particular cinematographic abilities, and there is no doubt that the film's greatest asset is the captivating, creepy-choir-augmented soundtrack. With its strange dreamlike quality, the film is at most interesting, yet it pales next to the surreal and brilliant "Black Moon" by Louis Malle of the same era. Certainly deserving of the debate on art against pornography, because unlike many forbidden films, Pasolini's "Salo" or Larry Clark's "Ken Park", for example, the film is rather irrelevant from an artistic point of view. It seems that cinema is gradually losing its capacity for shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for having retained that power thirty years after its release. However, the shock value is the only reason why the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. Yet even Nazism does it.
