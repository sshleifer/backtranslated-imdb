The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comic. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I saw a film that does not do justice to his true ability. The only thing I found in this film is its production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. Furthermore, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps are easily sold and were revolutionary at the time. In addition to the production value, I can say very little that it is good or funny in this film.
