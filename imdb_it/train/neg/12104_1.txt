Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a group of rabbis who invent deformed machines to circumvent Sabbath regulations, in reality they do not attack Judaism and seem enraged when a rabbi effectively challenges the existence of the state of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. This is proof of his complete and total lack of objectivity or attention in the creation of this film. I find it really hard to believe that man is atheist or even intelligent. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs, but what should you offer in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks he is stupid. What makes him "rational" in the room? In a way it reflects how he really isn't and in the process he ends up looking just as stupid as those people. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film / documentary on the real ills of religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, look at the root of all the evils of Richard Dawkins? It is a brilliantly researched documentary, which clearly outlines what it hopes to achieve and how. <br /> <br /> Religulous by Bill Maher is not funny, it does not ask interesting questions or give any idea on such a controversial topic. It seems to be the disappointments and disappointments of an old man who is dissatisfied with his Catholic education. I'm almost sorry for him.
