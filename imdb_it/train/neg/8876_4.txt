A kind of family parody that mixes "An Officer And A Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and no doubt other films I can't remember now) in a rather boring film, with some bright spots . The gags are always where you would expect, and Damon Wayans' jokes are, well, predictable. As I said, unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
