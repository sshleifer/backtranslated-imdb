This must be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. The plot seemed as intriguing as that of Passenger 57. But with the latter film it somehow worked much better. The plot was developed in the worst possible way. Just some of the awful moments of the movie, A flight attendant is standing in the open door of a 747 wheel and is trying to close the door without being sucked in by the winds of 250 miles per hour?!? From that moment on, the plane starts from a few miles starting at 8000 feet, which is impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When on the track (perfectly straight of course) she is asked to pull the flaps, HUH !! The flaps are there to ensure lifting at low speeds, when the thrust is used on the catwalk backwards on the engines and gives maximum power! I can go on and on about small and especially big mistakes in the movie, but then my answer would have become the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to lose, trust me on the word!
