Oh dear. good cast, but writing and directing is an art and writing with spirit and direct spirit is a bit of a task. Even doing a good comedy you have to get the timing and the right time. I'm not putting everything down there where I laughed loudly but that was a few times. The main goal for me was the fast and smooth dialogue, which made some people in the film annoying. It may sound fantastic while reading the script in your head, but getting it out and the camera is a different task. And the manual work of the camera gives energy to a few parts of the film. The general management was good, but the script wasn't all that for me, but I'm sure you were reading the script in your head that would sound good. Sorry.
