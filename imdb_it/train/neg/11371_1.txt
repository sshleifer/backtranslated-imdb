The "documentary", and we use that term apparently apparently, sums up that Muslims are trying to violently conquer the world. So he says that any Muslim who does not admit this is either ignorant of his faith or lying in the face! Furthermore, every person interviewed in the film has found a market for its ridiculous take of reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others think about them. What the West needs to know is that this is nothing but propaganda aimed at the mental midget. If you are looking for a real documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle East, I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides more points of view from qualified sources.
