"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many films of the 50s about teenagers who crowd and meet the supernatural. In this case, the boys cannot pay the rent for their meeting and they are evicted. With no other place to go, they decide on a seemingly haunted house. As you may have guessed, once you arrive, some strange things start to happen. And in the end there is a turning point. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this film that you have not seen in other films, but it is still good entertainment. My favorite character was the dark-mouthed parrot. Well, let me rephrase this: he didn't talk like a character in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things we don't expect from a bird. The pure hokum of the film, but harmless.
