Eyes of the Werewolf (1999) is a really bad film. The premise was true, but the overall execution was simply terrible. I want the filmmakers to take their time with this project instead of bringing it into production. A blind guy gets new eyes, the bad thing is that they belong to an old werewolf. Bad things start happening to the guy as he turns into a flashy-looking creature. Can you find a cure before your hot girlfriend finds out? Who is that weird little troll that helps him and what's up with that cop? If you really want to find out, take a look at Eyes of the Werewolf! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea for a movie. I just wish the filmmakers spent a lot of time on pre-production before they decided to shoot the film.
