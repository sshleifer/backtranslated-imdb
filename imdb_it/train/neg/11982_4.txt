In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (like Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (like Lizzie Praskins) oversee the marriage of their children, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before the celebration, Miss Dressler turns her little town's kingdom into a bank with her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity. Banker Foster is able to survive, thanks to the wise planning of mother Dressler. But Mrs. Moran is worried about her luck and is clamoring for a complete withdrawal. Other clients of "Warren Bank" listen to Moran's deception and begin to question their solvency. Soon, the family is in financial crisis. <br /> <br /> The huge hit of Dressler's critical and financial film "Emma" was released earlier this year, and MGM should have wanted to get a new Dressler movie as soon as possible Dressler's 1931 hits, "Reducing" and "Politics" were still making a lot of money; and, Dressler had become the No. 1 in the United States Box Office Star of 1932, according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications. "Prosperity" has certainly celebrated the status of Dressler, but the production appears unusually sloppy and hasty. The cast is good, considering. Any other care in the direction and modification, and some filming, would have helped? apparently, they needed it in holiday cinemas. <br /> <br /> **** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Anita Page, Norman Foster
