I work in a Blockbuster store and every week we have films that come with only a few copies, these are the films that the Sci-Fi channel shows. The kind of movies that nobody would ever want, and only those pagan idiots, when they bring him back I ask them "was it something good?", They say "no, we turned off after 15 minutes!" Movies with terrible computer-generated monsters, super-imposed monsters and the like, very unattractive. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of film as Grendel, and it's an absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonable (and only reasonably) good movie based on Beowulf, then try Beowulf & Grendel, with Gerard Butler, who is also the protagonist in the expected 300, as King Leonidas of Sparta. <br /> <br /> Also, later this year we have another Beowulf film, with a starry cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins to Brendan Gleeson, to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But don't let yourself be convinced like we all did with Eragon, or we're all in for another big disappointment. <br /> <br /> And as for rentals, here's my general rule: if there's only one or two copies, don't rent it because it's a shit load. (This is true 99.9% of the time, generally not true if the title is foreign or a documentary.)
