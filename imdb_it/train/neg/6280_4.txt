Have you ever had a beautiful image in your mind that you thought would be nice to be in a movie: how to see a detective peering through the cracks of a broken fence of an abandoned house? Or see a woman walking down the street with a cold, intense and terribly alert air? Yes. Imagine stretching the image to an entire movie, you have pretty much the idea of ​​Broken, even if there are no detectives in this movie, I'm just using it as a visual example. But the intense-looking woman is here and has filled almost 99% of the viewing time. I have nothing to complain about that woman, it's a perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open individual who can find pleasure in every kind of artistic expression and I can really enjoy it really moody stuff. It would be really nice to be able to frame a scene from this movie and hang it on the wall. Let's be honest here, the acting is superb. Some of the expressions on the actors' faces are what keep me watching. <br /> <br /> Now on the problem of this movie. Beyond the mood, there's not much else here. The director basically took the obsession of an idea and managed it far beyond what was worth. I don't consider it a spoiler if I say that the obsession is "mirror". Let's face it, this unique idea is all over the bloody place and that's all the director has got to work with. Of course, there are some twists and turns here and there. If you have paid attention, nothing will surprise you in the end, obvious holes in the plot. <br /> <br /> Now, I haven't been taking bones with this art style since I had fun most of the time. I still believe that we should judge an artistic basis on the medium he uses to express all that artists want to express. The film is not a piece of music, a photo, a painting or even a poem, and certainly not just a beautiful image in your mind. It's all this plus a good story and character development. I consider Lynch's style of the film that he cheats. It is irresponsible and cheap and a waste of the medium. We gave the films 2 hours of film duration for a good reason. Therefore, we should judge it differently from judging a single frame of images like a photograph or a painting. <br /> <br /> This film is not completely Lynch style, thank goodness. It has a linear development and eventually comes to a conclusion. It doesn't have much history or character development. It appeared rather seriously with characters composed of ordinary people, therefore distanced from other things of fantasy at least from the surface. It offers no explanation of the fantasy element nor has it ever attempted to build a coherent world around it. The strangeness comes from nothing and seems rather isolated and accidental. Perhaps the coherence remains in the director's mind, but from what I can see he hasn't made much effort to make it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Where did you put your commitment back then? He seems to have spent a lot of effort to set the mood and improve it with music. Music often creates tension that eventually turns into teasing. Only in the next part of the film did fear and tension materialize. <br /> <br /> In the end, I felt: OK, I know what you're trying to say here, but is this the point you're trying to make by spending two hours accumulating all these tensions? It is rather irrelevant to who the characters are and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about who the characters are. All we have is this circumstance that has just been put. Disappointing, but I guess the director didn't have much material to work with and that shows.
