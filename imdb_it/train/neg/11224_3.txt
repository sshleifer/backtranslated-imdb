... and even then, they too can live without seeing it. To be honest, this film (if one deigns to call it that) is of real interest only to slavery fanatics. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new (and I mean * nothing *), nor will they appreciate the warm nuances of experiencing something familiar, loved or loved. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about the abysmal script, the wood, the acting outside the theater community, the absolute lack of direction, the disgusting lighting or the rest of the basement production values. This is definitely "Hey, guys, let's make a movie!" creation of films of the lowest order. I suppose one could be grateful that at least they knew how to operate the camera. No, I'm sorry to say that none of this is relevant to why this thing is so openly * wrong *. <br /> <br /> It is wrong because the young woman plays Bettie Page, a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is her dark hair and trademark, she can not bring anything to the role beyond the will to be bound and gagged. This is apparently a good thing for his film career before and after this miserable excess, but not for the unfortunate excess in itself, which consists mainly of a series of lovingly re-enacted set-pieces embedded in horribly horrible faux-biographical scenes that outline Ms The page has fallen from grace (so to speak). In reality, there is probably more information, per se, about Page life in the opening and closing titles than the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled. This is not a movie worthy of a friend of "The Notorious Bettie Page". This is not a worthy film. This is a fetish piece that takes advantage of the charm of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time, and does it without class, without style and without any real sense of understanding of the character of Bettie Page whatsoever. No real Bettie Page fan will find anything that is not a disappointment, I guarantee you. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs. If free, remember that time is money too. Your may not be worth much, but I bet it's worth your time to lose time with this. Here, I'm done, you've been warned.
