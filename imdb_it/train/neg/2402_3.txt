A surprising lack of fire from the usual reliable Larry Cohen (God Told Me Too, Q, etc.), Full Moon High is so difficult to be fun and fails miserably, even with decent turns from Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin seems embarrassed throughout his performance and his son Adam simply looks numb. This makes Teen Wolf a comedy classic.
