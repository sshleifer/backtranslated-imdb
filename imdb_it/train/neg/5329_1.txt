As a true Elvis fan, this film is a total embarrassment and the script is a disaster. The film opens with the beautiful son "Stay Away" and the Grand Canyon scenery offers the viewer the hope of something special. Elvis enters the scene and his talent is wasted a lot of time, especially on the rest of the songs in the foreground. I sat through this movie twice, just to make sure it was a piece of junk !!! 1 out of 10 !!!
