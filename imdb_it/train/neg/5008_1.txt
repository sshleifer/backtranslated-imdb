There is no reason to see this film. A good idea of ​​the plot is very badly managed. In the middle of the film everything changes and from there nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings has not been clarified. The acting is terrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. It was excellent in In the Bedroom, but it's terrible here. Amber Benson of Buffy, must change her character one day. Even those of you who love free sex and violence will be disappointed. Even if the film was 80 minutes long, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this), there are no deleted scenes on the DVD, which means that they never bothered to insert the missing parts into the characters. /> <br /> Don't spend time with this.
