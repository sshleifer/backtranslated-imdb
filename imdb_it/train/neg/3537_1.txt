I was convincing the world that it didn't exist ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that is probably remembered by many people. It is from The Usual Suspects, of course, in relation to Kaiser Gold ... I mean Sose .. <br /> <br /> I took another similar one: -The most stupid trick that a director has ever shot was trying to convince an audience that actually had a tram <br /> <br /> This film is one of the saddest films I've seen in a long time. It starts so well, with really great cinematography, fantastic acting and a very clever premise. But alas, the only way this movie is heading is a self-destruction course. And it does so, not with a single blow but with annoying little wrist cuts. <br /> <br /> Don't notice the comments here that are amazed that they found a way to explain this donut. With enough alcohol in my brain I would probably be able to explain the very existence of humanity to a very plausible degree. I saw and read about a dozen totally different ways in which people explained the story. And they vary from a story set entirely in the head of someone, playing chess with himself, to a clever way in which a criminal can defeat his enemies, resembling chess games. <br /> <br /> And that's all happy. But at the same time it is a painful homage that there is something terribly wrong with this story. And apart from that, it is in any case an abrupt rip-off of a series of films and books such as "Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Suspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle." And we are not dealing with kind loans here, it is a brazen boldness. <br /> <br /> What ultimately goes wrong in this film is that the plot swirls like a drunken speed bum. If this film were a roller coaster ride, you would have crashed into the attraction a short distance from takeoff: there are so many twists in this film that they will never be resolved, that if it were a cocktail, you would need an escort vital to dry droppings to make the nausea work after drinking Nothing has ever been explained and when you finally understand the direction you think it's going, you'll take another one. <br /> <br /> I don't think this story went anywhere on paper and Ritchy must have thought it was great to make a movie anyway, being the next David Lynch or something like that. <br /> <br /> 1/10 f or totally violating his work (Ritchy: looking for professional help). What could easily have become a gem instead becomes an invented piece of art, food for pseudo-intellectuals to discuss in Sunday's discussion clubs. <br /> <br /> Save your soul and your stomach, avoid at all costs!
