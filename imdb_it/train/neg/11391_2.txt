When I started watching this movie, I was looking for some sort of subtle metaphors, but I soon realized that this movie was really about people on a train. Interactions between people are like those that can be seen every day on the street and when on some occasions there is a situation that is a little more interesting, dialogue becomes sharp and boring. It's not that I don't understand how this film is trying to portray the way people interact, it's just that in this film they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze this type of relationship, you'd better go out and buy a train ticket and watch people on the train with you. It's realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a movie about you sitting there watching the movie.
