The comparison is perhaps unfair, but inevitable. Those who are attracted by the intimacy and depth of the Umbrellas will be a little horrified to discover a "cut and paste" musical in the American style - embarrassing and stylish dialogues with numbers of songs and inexplicable dances. The French accent of Gene Kelly was apparently so poor, that a terrible dubbing job was replaced (as you will remember, dubbing was performed almost perfectly in Umbrellas). Even the translation of French (for subtitled versions) leaves something to be desired, although this cannot be attributed to Demy. The film also has several moments of self-awareness that turn out to be disconcerting, like the references in the songs to LeGrand himself. And the costumes - well, the combination of tight pants / white boots, and incredibly unnatural colors, are reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie. . . <br /> <br /> But Demy rewards the viewer with allusions to the Umbrellas; note, for example, the suitcase brought from Maxence in its departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase brought by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg. Also note the "Affordable Brunette of the Resolution" - Madeleine in Umbrellas and Josette in Young Girls. <br /> <br /> In general, those who expect the natural feeling of Umbrellas (save the scene of the floating bicycle), or who are looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella's script should probably pass at this point . Those looking for a French version of a thin 60s American musical will be quite happy.
