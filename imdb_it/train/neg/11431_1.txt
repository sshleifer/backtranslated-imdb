It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have "gray issues" will agree that this film does not work. <br /> <br /> The problems are in the direction, in the cast selections and lack of depth in the construction of the character. The word comedy was a very difficult thing to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's take a look at the problems of direction / script. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister, both in their mid-30s seem to be well adapted. They meet a complete stranger in a park and the character of Heather Graham approaches her and asks the most intimate questions that even a half sane person would run to the other side or at least shout for a police officer. Then he awkwardly turns and makes some stupid statements and she falls in love with him. Then, after ONE appointment, I went out together and fell in love with her and decided to get married in Las Vegas in a week's time ???? Hi does anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out with thousands of women and meets this person who says about 10 words we see on the screen and wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, but it makes no sense. Certainly it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it, but the direction made it completely flat. <br /> <br /> Now also Heather falls headlong with her and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very superficial character) kiss or more to the point that it was the hardest kiss of that chemistry that could be there. I found it unromantic and not very funny and while many say that Heather cannot act I think the reality is that Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was Sue Kramer's debut as a director and for me it was too much for her to chew. It would take a lot of art to make this movie work and IMHO could be done with better writers and casting and directors.
