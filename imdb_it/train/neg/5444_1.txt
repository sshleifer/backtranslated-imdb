It was 1974 and he played Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> Only this tells what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had reformed, had a good woman and didn't want to fight. <br /> <br /> In real life, Slovik could have been a naive innocent, or perhaps he just wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was or wasn't Slovik is the story to decide, but this was a film that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting, and the film took sides. <br /> <br /> Regardless of the military who were in Viet Nam in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's face it, it was the Vietnam War, not the Second World War), EoES was as propagandistic as Gung Ho era in the forties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik declared his position clear and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervous condition, and trust me, if I had done military duty, it wouldn't have been a problem for me to let go of my nerves and fail in my homework and get a demotion or put in KP service or latrine service without problems. <br /> <br /> If we believe in the teleflick, Slovik has not had this option, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I have learned that the films of this decade or that decade, in dealing with service or military service, will take up virtually the same position over and over again. <br /> 1940 and 1950, serve your country. <Br /> <br /> 60s and 70s, make fun of your country. <br /> <br /> This is the story. <br /> <br /> The whole film seemed to me to be Hollywood. He refused to serve and only showed emotion when he was tied up. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional outburst could easily have worked to his advantage in his statement of his nervous state, but obviously the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sad. <br /> <br /> I am not Catholic, but I thought about the recital of Hed Mary by Ned Beatty and Sheen in the end, with the Lord's prayer, it was fun because it seemed that they were trying to see who could say it faster. <br /> <br /> I don't see how this film can be seen without realizing it to Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> I hope it's worth it for Slovik and for anyone who has chosen to follow his example.
