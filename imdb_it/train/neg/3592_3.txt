For a series of fans, I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not so bad. However, the revision of this series cannot be based on whether it is a series of fans or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Even creativity. I think they are people with an ordinary job and a big heart enthusiast for Star Trek. But doing all this work. Pulling all these resources. Taking all this time, and still all those flaws. <br /> <br /> First of all the acting, and the lines are horrible. For the most part. Dialog boxes belong to a military show of the 1970s, not in Star Trek. The captain (Mr Squinty) seems to be about to burst out laughing at any time. And most of the characters are just reading their lines. Administrators should be aware that "resuming" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also imagine that the series are made in the "Two Takes Frakes" way, which has directed many of the TNG episodes and movies. Also, I couldn't help thinking that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without further exploring this hypothesis. <br /> <br /> My biggest concern for the whole project is the quality of the publications. When did they decide to dedicate so much time and resources to this series, why didn't they make it available in a decent quality? Using the fast time format with low low resolution is a waste of talent. Even the "higres" episodes are considered to be of poor quality compared to the standard quality series. With the use of the Xvid codec, with greater resolution and file size, the experience would have been massively improved. If the band with problems was the problem, the creation of a torrent tracker would have solved it. <br /> <br /> We hope the crew decides to brush the series, and maybe publish it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project it deserves.
