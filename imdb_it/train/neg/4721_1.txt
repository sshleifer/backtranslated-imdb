Before seeing this film, please consult the reviews available on the Internet concerning the falsification of the film's events, in particular its prevarications on the widely accepted fact that 7-8,000 Muslim men were expelled from Srebrenica and killed by Serbian paramilitaries. The documentary also belongs to various pro-Serbian American organizations. Please watch this movie critically, and read reviews in advance. Most reviews claim that the documentarian takes his arguments too far, even though it raises questions that aim at conventional wisdom about war. A review of Stephen Holden's NYTimes states that it would be "imprecise to label this pro-Serbian documentary", but both the presentation of the facts, many of which are taken from reliable sources, and the omission of those facts that inculcate forces should be questioned Serbian. I don't recommend seeing this documentary, but I warn you to examine it with a particularly critical eye (as it should always be done in any case).
