Don't waste your time looking at this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things you shouldn't do to make a good movie. I'm not usually a reviewer for a movie, but this is personal. I lost precious time that they cannot return. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time looking at this shit. If this was a student project, I should say not bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it becomes annoying. the scream, the bad audio, the bad video (a good cameraman could have made it much better). and yes, what is the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I was hoping it would get better, but it's not like that. Now how the hell did he deserve a 4? 2 is more right but 1 to waste time! I said my peace.
