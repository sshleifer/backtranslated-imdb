This is a terrible film, and not a scene has an ounce of sincere emotion. The characters are not inflexible, obviously drawn, predictable and the plot is obvious and the typical desire of Hollywood to be realized. <br /> <br /> William Holden (so sad to see him in this role) was 55 years old when this film was made, but he plays someone in his early 40s and looks like he's about 60 years old. Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find it irresistibly attractive. I think the dog they found on the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connection. <br /> <br /> The character of Holden - the same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film, (not) by coincidence - is placed with obvious traps from the '60s pre-hippy cool: celibacy, the swing swing, lunches at Yamashiro. But the film is ridiculously unresolved, a clash of old fogies who desperately want the free spirits they saw on Sunset and Laurel Canyon to find them sexy and their great honkin machines. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture has never been so desperate. And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for young people to take this embarrassing part.
