This is a film that attempts to tell the story of Thailand, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films that I saw and appreciated, one that has Thai actors who talk about Thai madness and martial arts. Well, it's nothing like that. This film is shot entirely in English, is chock-full of Anglo actors and has such terrible production values ​​that it's ridiculous ... but not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? The acting, the dialogue and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some of the fighting scenes seemed to have been choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also largely bad, but some were just a cheap animation applied to the screen that provided a particularly poor effect. It has a great epic-style battle scene, in which several thousand extras can cross a field in costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat - HA! What a joke! The film has a couple of beauties. Too bad they didn't show a little more skin. At least it would have been something the boys would have appreciated. Do not worry
