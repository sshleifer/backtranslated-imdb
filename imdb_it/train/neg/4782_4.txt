1st watched 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): emotional Christmas fluff that is not really specific to explain how the real story happened in this incident based on the facts of a man who is wrongly put in prison to look for a job because his family make Christmas happen for them. The three children of the family run away from home on a trip to Washington D.C. to enlist the then president of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This trek offers some secondary stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, which makes the story a bit like a Disney "fleeing animal" movie and doesn't fit perfectly. In the end, there are no details on how the president helped the family and this is another downpoint of the film, in my opinion. The film eventually brings tears, but it takes too long to get to this. The film should not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb) but has the obvious fades that make it look like this ?? so I'm not sure their information is accurate. All in all, this is a simple film (which could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas story, but played blandly and without much substance.
