This is one of the worst movies I've seen. The only positive thing I can say is that he was so ugly that he seemed comical. First of all, there is no plot. The actors seem to be reading the charts and doing the most stupid things. Like being chased by dead people but still wanting to go out and look for their friends. Even the zombies were terrible, they weren't even as funny as Romero's, which fit into the film. And the stupidest thing was that they continued to show video game flashes in the action sequences. As if we didn't have a video game, I should shoot the zombies. Also, all 20 people know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even pointing the gun. And the way people die is so stupid. It's like they're out of ammunition, so you're waiting to be jumped on. And when they're stuck in front of their house they run out of ammunition instead of shooting at the door, so stupid. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then they have been blessed with a second chance. Definitely the worst movie I've seen in years. A B movie on cinemax is better.
