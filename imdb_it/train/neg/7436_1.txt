This film is a waste of time and money. For the whole hour and a half I kept waiting for it to improve and it never happened. It was slow, the plot skipped, it wasn't scary or interesting, and in reality it was never anything. The credits during the introduction were long and neat, which was basically like the rest of the film (long and complex). Many parts of the plot made no sense. Several times during the film I thought that maybe I had "zoned" because of the incongruity of the plot, however, my partner had the same problem and assured me that I did not "exclude" boredom, but it was really the film. I've never actually posted here on a movie and I've been actively searching on IMDb on IMDb for many years. So the fact that I'm actually taking the time to write something should talk about how bad this movie is and that you shouldn't waste time or money.
