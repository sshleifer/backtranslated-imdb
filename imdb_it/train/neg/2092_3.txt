Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the story of Cylon origin. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many narrative lines and clog it up with too many POV characters that bog down the narrative. The plot insinuates itself at glacial speeds dissipating the tension it might have had. In each episode, little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI ​​version of his late daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by Soldiers of One (STO), a clandestine monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of Commander Adama of "Battlestar Galactica") is struggling to keep his family together while looking for the AI ​​version of his daughter (also died in the explosion) in a virtual Machiavellian version of Caprica (which strongly resembles the 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to dull writing, Caprica suffers from a problem similar to many original stories. We already know how it ends (ie the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).
