I'm 17 and I still like many of the Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love films from the 90s, and recently we were treated to one of the best DVD releases Scooby Doo of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I didn't expect to be as good as before. In any case, go back to Get a Clue! I've seen some episodes, expecting something very beautiful, but from what I've seen, it didn't hit me at all. First of all, I hated animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday-morning -cartoon-standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows that I really hate have had a slightly better animation. Worse still, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was definitely good. I also hated character changes, because instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes, something they would never have done in movies or in Scooby-Doo Where Are You? to exhibit. Even the melody of the theme was not very good, I can't even remember it, and the lines were lame and artificial. However, I recognize that there is a very talented cast, if they had better material, and we were not told to sound as different from the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, I might add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was horrible, and I'm not trying to discredit it, it's what I feel personally. 1/10 Bethany Cox
