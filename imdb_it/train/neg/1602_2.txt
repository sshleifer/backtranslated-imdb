Anyone who thinks this film has not been appreciated for its comic genius must have smoked with the two stoners of the film. This movie is NOT underestimated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparison between this film and The Naked Gun or Airplane because the last two films are well written and fun. The class meeting is none of those things. The sad thing is that it had such potential (good cast, good plot) but good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that should have been fun turned out to be more annoying than funny. The stoner types, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT FUN. The only funny character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). National Lampoon has made some really good films (Animal House, Vacation) but this is not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
