I watched the film and was dismayed to say that the film failed to communicate with me as an audience. The tongue would have shamed the street moccasins. <br /> <br /> The plot; a father who forces anyone of his son to marry, seems unlikely. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her nephew to mess up an enemy would only attract the weak-minded attention. <br /> <br /> ... and I was waiting for the whole movie for a laugh and laugh I made up my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie doesn't even deserve a first look. <br /> <br /> I hope you save your time!
