This film does not really promote children to be nicer and have better attitudes, as a family film should do, and this would still not be considered a family because it has some things children should not see. It's not the best ABC Family movie if you ask me. If there were fewer sexual themes in the film, then maybe it would be better. Hollywood is not doing anything to improve a movie by adding sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I would not waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do besides watching this movie, please proceed with them.
