OK, I know a lot of people will probably resent this review as Watership Down is a "classic" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this movie for the first time at the tender age of 18, I have to admit: I really hated it. <br /> <br /> We watched this film because my sister had read the book and had a great time, and many people who were whining about the words "Watership Down" - their memories of seeing the movie like children and their emotions torn from the seams recommended it. To be honest, I wish I hadn't worried. I gave him the benefit of the doubt; in general I don't like to stop watching a movie halfway. This was an exception. He was really, really, atrociously, disgustingly boring. This film was probably the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a snail drugged in space), and actually it didn't "do" for me. The art was fine; the backgrounds were well made if not a bit bland and tiny, yet the rabbits themselves weren't very appealing and the animation was rather nervous and poorly produced. <br /> <br /> I have no intention of entering into huge details on The plot; basically it is the story of a group of rabbits that leave their maze due to the infiltration of humans into the area. Generally a moralistic story about the dangers of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to convey the message. As for me, I would have preferred them to be gassed, not because I'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninteresting, annoying, boring, and generally rather rude (oh I'm so terribly English). I found out that I was constantly watching the watch while watching the movie, and it took about 20 minutes before something happened, and that was a terrible defeat too. <br /> <br /> If I were to praise In any case, I would have to admit that the concept of showing children the dangers of building in the countryside and, hopefully, revealing the arrogance of human beings, etc., is well intentioned. Perhaps he is everything in general sweet and preacher, but the message he is trying to propose is good in his nature. Even the soundtrack wasn't bad. <br /> <br /> So to conclude, this film is rather poor. I could not look at him completely, or I would probably be forced to eat my own legs out of pure boredom. Of course, it's not "Torque" bad, but it still doesn't have a high value in my eyes, so I gave it a 2/10. <br /> <br /> I hope this helps.
