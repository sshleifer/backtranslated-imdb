Here is the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually stunning animated film in the current home theater version. The works of art and the effects are revolutionary and I advise you to give this film an appearance by virtue of the graphics alone. <br /> <br /> And now for the bad news. I'm serious when I say that animation is the only thing this film is doing. Perhaps you will remember that "Spirit" was abused by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person who claims that it's because Disney is more established and has better publicity can write me a four-page essay entitled "Why 'Script by Lilo and Stitch' doesn't stink." <br /> <br /> For all the incredible new animation technology on display in "Spirit", the story is almost * incredibly * boring. There is a lesson here and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated films. You can have the most amazing visual effects ever to beautify a mortal's eyes, but if your story is boring and, most importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's a bad film production. Simple like that. The animation is still amazing; I can't wait to see what a person with more imagination can do with it.
