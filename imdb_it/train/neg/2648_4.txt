I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos' work and MacDonald's TCM Magazine photo in her angel costume looked fantastic (awesome wings), so I thought I'd watch this movie. I had never heard of the film before, so I had no preconceived ideas about it. I thought it was a nice start with Eddy as the playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene in which she presents herself at the costume party in her simple angel dress with an uncooperative halo and wings that don't stop has been really captivating. I was even with the movie when Eddy falls asleep and imagines her as a real angel. But after a while he started to fall apart for me. Eddy remains "asleep" for the rest of the film, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from then on does not matter, because it is only dreaming. The rest was practically a less useless plot. I had to force myself to follow him. And the final number in which MacDonald switched from the musical number to the musical number in some crazy hallucination was simply absurd. <br /> <br /> Had Eddy "woke up" before and the original story continued, or if he had really married an angel, I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of his real character. <br /> <br /> There were not enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first songs were good, but the number of jitterbugs running MacDonald was like nails on a blackboard. Completely wrong for his operatic voice. Even so, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine, showing what the real stars were.
