This was a really bad movie. The "Cole" character played by Michael Moriarty was the main reason why he fell, the actor felt that evoking an incredibly embarrassing Southern disenchantment would make this character more evil, not so. After about 20 minutes I had wanted a speech therapist to make an appearance, this would add some sincerity. <br /> <br /> - 1) badly interpreted - 2) unpleasant characters - 3) thin line texture <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
