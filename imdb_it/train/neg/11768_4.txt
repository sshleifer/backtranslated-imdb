This reboot is like a meal prepared by McDonald's compared to the very good but underrated 2003 "The Incredible Hulk" by Ang Lee. <br /> <br /> "The Hulk" by Ang Lee is a comic film for the thinking person. Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when we see it we see the conflict in the heart of our protagonist. He does his best to avoid losing control, but as he admits, when he gives in to his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this to Edward Norton's turn, where there is no demonstration of conflict in his personality, and he turns into a Hulk every time he gets excited and his heart rate reaches 200 beats per minute ( not 183, not 197, but exactly 200). For this reviewer, this felt like the introduction of the midi-chlorian in The Phantom Menace, which indicates how strong the "force" is with one, as if the mystical abilities can be measured through a blood test. In the 2008 film, all Ed Norton's Ed Norton Banner needs to do is keep the heart rate below 200, as monitored by a wrist-tied device. And for the record, it is extremely difficult to get a heart rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions guide Eric Bana's Hulk. He repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early years. On the surface it is calm, but underneath there is a significant anger, enough anger to feed Hulk when it is unleashed. But Hulk never intentionally kills, not even his attackers. Mostly, he just wants to leave or close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He incapacitates his shooters and in a critical scene, he saves a fighter jet that pursues him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the 2003 film, the visual effects are there, but if necessary. Action scenes (and there are many) are necessary for the plot, unlike the 2008 film in which the action is inserted for reasons of action. <br /> <br /> In his attempt to turn it into a "fugitive" story, Ed Norton loses interest in how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment that went wrong. And Louis Leterrier, the director who takes up Ed Norton's cue, fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is chased and Hulk kicks, Banner is chased and Hulk kicks. Repeat if necessary. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that maybe it's not as loyal to the comics as the 2008 version. However, even though I'm a comic book fan, I'd rather have a movie that doesn't he is so loyal to comics as a fan's dream, but he has a heart above comics - a faithful but produced and soulless version of 2008 every day. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a film that is true to its comic book roots and has a heart.
