I haven't seen this film for centuries, but I thought I'd comment on it anyway, especially since the memory of not liking it so intensely is burned in my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was not a prize to begin with, but at least it had the distinction of being 1) A film by Sam Peckinpah, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) It was a relatively painless way to blow an hour and a half time. <br /> <br /> In comparison, the 1994 version looks like little more than a piece of vanity for the then fiery Alec Baldwin and his next divorced wife, Kim Basinger. Even McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride broke up soon after their version of the film was made and one can imagine the Baldwins to their marriage counselor discussing who is the stupid idea of ​​making this film. <br /> <br /> Let's face it and get it out of the way - Alec Baldwin has never been and will never be close to Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake bothered me so much is the alleged arrogance on Baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. As someone else points out, the vision of Peckinpah's 1972 film was a piece of satire that wanted to be a kind of parody of the action / adventure genre. In contrast, Baldwin, Bassinger and the company seem to want to evoke a more serious tone, with only the slimy evil characters of Michael Madsen and James Woods coming out as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is also decidedly bad spirited and unpredictable at a fundamental level difficult to translate into words. A vision was more than sufficient, not only because it had nothing new to offer, but because of what had been done without art. Peckinpah's film was actually a small, elegant entertainment that had an optimistic mood, in which this version is a slogan that takes too long to become little or nothing. There is no artistic urgency for its existence and some of the most uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable as to make the film difficult. <br /> <br /> So I don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to start the wave of useless, artistically silly remakes of budgets supported around an actor / actress of a certain name, who for itself is not a really good thing. I always prefer to see a director at least try to invent a new idea for a film and fall flat with something original. This film made me want to get my eyebrows out, and it is revealing that for the next 15 years after his release, Mr. Baldwin became famous as one of the greatest Hollywood idiots. Thank God for "Team America" ​​for putting it in its place. <br /> <br /> 3/10
