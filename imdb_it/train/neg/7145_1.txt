Apparently Hollywood is distributing money to anyone who has a camera and the ability to talk. This film was terribly bad. The casting was terrible, the performance ineffable, and the story full of holes. Script? who needs a script? I was surprised that the film was not verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, however I had enough shots of T & A to last a lifetime. The film was like listening to a nineteen-year-old street runner with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of going to college) to tell a story. Being so misplaced, I thought the two brothers in the film were in love at first. The scenes on the track, together with the main actress who is the protagonist of the film, made me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded. This is the kind of movie that Grindhouse modeled after ... only writers thought they were serious.
