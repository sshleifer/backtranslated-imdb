What a horrible sight. Science Fiction fans seem to look at anything without regard to quality. It upsets me that something as exceptional as Firefly lasts a season, while waste like the Battlestar Galactica remake generates a spin off. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The acting is youthful and uninspired. The characters are cardboard clich√©s of everything that has ever been in a bad science fiction series. The story is ugly. Dialogue is worse than an early evening soap opera. The management is poor and the sets are horrible. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of energy. This is a spin off that should never have been realized.
