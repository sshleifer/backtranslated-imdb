Ashley Judd, in a youthful role and I think her first starring role, shows her rebellious real life nature in this slow-moving feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a vehicle for political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a feminist convinced in real life, she must have loved this script. No wonder the left wing critic Roger Ebert loved this film; it's his political alley. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I am happy that Judd rose from this funny fluff to better roles in the movies that entertained, not preached the heavy liberal program.
