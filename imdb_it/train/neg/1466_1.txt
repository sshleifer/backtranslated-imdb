<br /> <br /> As usual, I couldn't wait to see a new TV / movie on my favorite subject - it makes a nice change from a strangely familiar * documentary on Kursk or Stalingrad on the History Channel. <br /> <br /> I looked avidly at Pearl Harbor and Enemy at the Gates - but I was abruptly brought down with the realization of Hollywood's stupid and stupid power - and his ability to spend an absolute luck tripe. <br /> <br /> So once again I got excited about "The Rise of Evil", especially when I heard that Ian Kershaw was involved, since I liked his books. I can understand why he stopped. <br /> <br /> To quote a guy responsible for this garbage: <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic piece," he said. "It was quite dry, we needed more accidents." <br /> <br /> accidents? Are they totally crazy? Hitler's life cannot be said without an 'accident' - yes Hitler's biographies on Kershaw's two volumes were long and detailed, but they had to be. <br /> <br /> The thesis of "Rise of Evil" seems to be: <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man - no he was a VERY bad man, who hated the Jews, and in the case you miss this, we will underline the fact in EVERY scene of the film. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to try to explain the mood of the moment and why Hitler could have adopted the opinions and the strategy he did. Needless to say, unlike the "Nazis in general - A Warning from History" - this film neglected to emphasize the fact that almost all of the leaders of the communist movement in Munich were Jews, and this may have colored his views on the subject - and its axiomatic link to the Jews with Bolshevism - an absolutely crucial aspect to understanding much of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But there was not much understanding to be done - the directors were not going to go there, so we only have all the things we knew anyway. Surely we do not find the fascinating fact to which Kershaw alludes, in which Hitler was for a brief socialist / communist period immediately after the First World War. It would obviously be too complex for the film to handle, and it might even detract from the relentless mantra "was very bad" that shakes incessantly. <br /> <br /> We know he was a bad man. However, we also know that he was a mesmerizing character both as a public speaker and in more private situations. He could be polite and even sympathetic, and of course he put forward some opinions like vegetarianism, anti-alcohol and smoking, which many Guardian readers might agree with. He was also famous for animals, so why the whipping of the completely invented dog was so absurd. He was also, from all the stories I saw, a brave soldier in the First World War. While we saw him with his Iron Cross, we never saw how he won it (courageous acts were not in the script, needless to say). Furthermore we do not understand why he is so excited by his war experiences, while Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others have found such a repellent experience. And again, as in the previous point on the Jewish / Bolshevik connection, this is vital for anyone's understanding of the subject. Why did he love war so much? Why did he think it was always a good idea, despite the enormous evidence to the contrary? Why didn't he care about his colleagues who died? Or maybe he did - but he still got the wrong conclusions. <br /> <br /> Even this film has not had anything interesting to say about this. <br /> <br /> As too often these days, the film is a classic example of 'making history relevant to the present' and inventing stuff or leaving out uncomfortable facts to adapt to the 'present' - which too often is to satisfy the lowest common denominator, in which you wear Don't trust your audience by an inch, so just put things in your throat, knowing (sadly correctly) that you'll always get away with it because there are so many stupid idiots in the world. <br /> <br /> History really wants to make us relevant to the past and see how it colors our present, for better or for worse. This garbage was a great opportunity, lost again. We spent millions, and the locations and the big scenes were impressive, but they didn't tell us anything we didn't already know, and we didn't promote understanding of this dark period in human history. <br /> <br /> WT
