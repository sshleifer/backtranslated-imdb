I read a couple of good reviews on this forum for "Mr. Scarface", but for anyone not interested in the genre of Italian gangster films like me, the photo will probably make little sense. In fact, after the initial setup that included the 10 million lira scam, the image turned into a rather routine revenge movie with a small twist in the identity of the character of Rick (Al Cliver). The whole plot of the band was confused with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as many other commentators have commented, it is the only one who gave this photo a life with its often ineffective attempts at violence. I found somehow incredible that Manzari's henchmen who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually get shortened before Tony even got his hands on him. For all his accumulation as a title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an almost anticlimatic ending, making the US job title "Mr. Scarface" somewhat questionable. I've seen enough spaghetti westerns to know that not everyone works; I imagine that in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster movie didn't go so well.
