This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I can't really remember when I've seen a worse one. I thought it was an investigation into plane crashes. What was really is a soap opera and a bad one. They exaggerated with the "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour seems like a screaming match, with some implausible scenes thrown in. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-minute "memorial" scene (with black umbrellas and rain essential for victims of fictitious accidents was lame, and I thought it would never be finished. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs, unless you like "conflict". <br /> <br />
