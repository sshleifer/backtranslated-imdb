I really liked A Man Called Horse when it was published in 1970, but Return sounded like a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard in the role of Elk Woman, an elder of the tribe of the yellow hand, does not look like an Indian, nor half of the other "Indians", who were played by Italians, Mexicans and Latins with cheap wigs. And the old man who played the chief behaved more like an old squaw than a proud warrior leader. He even used the bow as a woman! In the end, Richard Harris, who did such an exceptional job in the original, seems to be wandering this time. I guess he couldn't resist the simple paycheck he had to resume his role as a horse. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some interesting moments in the film, such as the fact that Cavallo suffers a painful purification ritual for "find his vision" and gathers the Yellow Hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but overall, the Return is erratic, boring, trivial and predictable - just like most sequels.
