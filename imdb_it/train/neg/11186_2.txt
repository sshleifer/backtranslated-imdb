I wanted to see this movie, but one bizarre and ridiculous scene after another forced me to turn it off. The characters don't seem to react to anything. Consider this: Heath Ledger is walking for a night (through a graveyard I believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which drives away. Once past this ordeal, he quietly walks away and meets a friend who has seen it all. When asked what happens, he says blandly "attacked by demons, nothing serious". Like it's just a little more exciting than a flat tire. I close it when they go to ask for something - a demon or something, I stopped worrying ... a problem. The answer can only be rented to someone with the energy of their death, and the priest looks into what appears to be a vague annoyance when a man is hung and hung up and ask him about his dying body question, dying. <br /> <br /> 0 out of **** stars.
