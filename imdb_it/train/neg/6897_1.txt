I can see where the directors were going with this. But they never really reach their destination. It should be a tribute to Spaghetti westerns although set in a sort of mythical modern time period. "But unfortunately it is not up to his attempt: he does not have that gritty realism for which the spaghetti westerns are known. And quite as desperate as their western Italian counterparts and, in the absence of these two points, lacks the humor of a parody of success, in fact it seems that they intended to make a serious film, but in the end they realized that they had lost the target until that moment could not be taken seriously, unfortunately they too lost the mark of humor for a mile. whole bad movie!
