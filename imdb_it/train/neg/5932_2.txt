What kind of documentary about a musician can't include a single song by the artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is to relive the great songs themselves. Here, all the tracks are covers of uninteresting characters, and these interpretations fail to capture Cohen's slow and jazzy style. More often than not, covers are popular versions that are poorly sung. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are much or more with other musicians and characters than with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film show Cohen reading his work (he never sings) - like letters, poems, etc. The film has not really captured much on the life story of the artist, nor on its development over the years. A big disappointment for a big Cohen fan.
