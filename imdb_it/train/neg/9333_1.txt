Terrible!!! I don't want to be too negative, but this movie has a stupid IQ monkey. What a mess. I couldn't believe how bad this movie is. The dialogues are just very strange and off-topic, the camera sometimes works just awful, the music sometimes like a soundtrack for Lawrence of Arabia, I just watched this movie to see how much worse it can be. side is a total disaster. Excuse me but all my thumbs and fingers and everything that can hang down on my body is falling to the ground. Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows he is in financial crisis to take part in a fiasco film. . . . . this film should have been presented to all the students of all film schools only to teach them a lesson on how not to make a film
