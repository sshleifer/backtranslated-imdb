I'm not saying this because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was shot terribly. That shot of the girl who washes her hair in the creek? Did we really need to sit there for a shot too long and see it do this for 5 minutes in the same spot? It was terrible, the lighting was simply bad. You could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. Did I watch the whole movie? Of course I didn't skip most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone say that I need to look first to judge it. This film was made and performed so badly that even with low and independent budgeting standards it is simply terrible. Terrible film ... don't waste time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even in this case it's not because of the "funny" lines of the actors, it's because of how painfully bad the production.
