A painfully prolonged, Maudlinian and predictable drama, my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet film, Garbo Talks, is hastily filed to the bottom of my search. <br /> <br /> The film documents an irritated young worker named Gilbert (Ron Silver), who is the son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, exuberant and, above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle is hit by a brain tumor, her son decides to go into his obsessive search: he finds Greta Garbo and takes her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is in full swing, the aunt-mom chew-the-scenery mode here, that kind of exuberant girl who loves the movie, where she talks to people, and defends her ideals , and ends up in jail all the time. It is outside the film like an obvious artificial construct, and every scene with her is lame yuk-yuk; every note is false. The rest of the characters are equally one-dimensional, but tremendously less interesting. Ron Silver is as flat as he can be, and his attempted love triangle is wired like anything else in the film: he goes out with Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but is struck by the strange colleague Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and I called every scene three scenes before they happened. <br /> <br /> This is the other problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are placed in an intriguing and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The rhythm of the film is glacial, resplendent with foreign material that strengthens absolutely nothing, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is at the same time tiring and uninteresting. There are many guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine this) in another highly unessential scene. <br /> <br /> In the late movie, try to make a decent half statement about the nature of idolatry and its role in our lives, but at that time, none of the characters exist as real people, and the film has me bored to submission, so it works like a case of too little, far too late. The film is my twenty-fifth film directed by Lumet, making it easily my most watched director, but outside of a couple of egregious missions (A Stranger Among Us, anyone?), He hasn't probed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks . <br /> <br /> {Rating: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (of 24) of 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet films}
