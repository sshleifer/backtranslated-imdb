Comedy Central has been successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report are all professional comics and all, or, in the case of Chapelle Show, were solid shows. Since Sarah Silverman is one of the best cartoonists in the industry, I expected good things when I tuned myself. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some fun sequences, but since the star is the caliber of Silverman, the show could have been much better. He was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's show will be better. Otherwise, help him in the form of best writers for the show.
