I didn't think this movie was worth anything of bad script, bad acting except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, stupid husband and unfair divorce situations. If you've never seen this movie before, don't worry that it's not worth it. The only good thing was that Janine Turner was doing a good job acting. Terry's husband is a cunning and astute defense lawyer, who has won a lot of cases and has even hired assassins of guilt√†. He thinks he's so smart but he's really crazy. Her best friend has a relationship with her husband and betrays her. Beautiful girl eh. Yes, it's a real peach, no. It's not even a day at the beach.
