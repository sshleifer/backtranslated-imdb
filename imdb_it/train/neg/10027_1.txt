The action in this film beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar owns the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is funny. Except for the typical comedy by Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor, I see nothing positive in this film. The story seems that the writer told his 10-year-old son to write. The film is so unreal that Anil Kapoors's long-range shot with a shotgun is the director's least mistake. Except for the Tashan directors, there is no other Tashan to make this film. I am sorry to waste my money on this film and I would not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 is the minimum I can give on IMDb or give a zero.
