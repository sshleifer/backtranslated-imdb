My wife and I love renting silly horror / science fiction movies and watching them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this film is horrible, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, the camera work, the plot, the costumes, is so bold and low budget, but that's what makes it so good. I think in a scene the actors really looked like they were walking on the spot. I really hope that anyone who made this film wasn't serious when they made it, because if they were, then it would be just sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them, I recommend this.
