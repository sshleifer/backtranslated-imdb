I watched this movie alone, in the dark, and it was a full moon outside! I didn't do it on purpose, it just happened that way. So there were all the elements for this movie to scare me to death !! Well, I didn't, in fact I wanted to close the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought I'd give it a chance, unfortunately I did. The acting was horrible, the only one with decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The plot isn't original, if you're a horror fan, then it's the same thing you've seen many times before. Some scenes didn't make sense, and you only have the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment in the film. The (scary) scenes seemed to belong to a horror movie of the 1980s when there was not enough technology, yet some good films were made at that time! I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the film, I thought they couldn't put some money into this and make it decent? !! I could not agree more with the assessments the film got, it is also my assessment for this, 3 out of 10.
