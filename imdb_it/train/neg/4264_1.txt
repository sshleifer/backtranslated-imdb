this film disappointed me very hard. it was a great concept that was ruined by a horrible script. History did not flow and was separated at best. There were so many elements in this story that were not explained, or were forced into place without any real thought. elements like the romance may have been expanded a little more, and the cannons need to be written better. the entire main character growing up needed more about the training he was receiving and less about. everyone likes a good story about the "kid over" and this showed promise but with scripting failures it didn't have to be. While it had some pyrotechnic effects in the final battle sequence it was weak due to the lack of choreography. this fact for a tediously boring watch <br /> <br /> could have been so good :(
