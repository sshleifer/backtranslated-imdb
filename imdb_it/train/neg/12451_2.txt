This movie is fun, not in a good way. The fights are terribly bad, while sometimes they try to hit you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, certainly not enough to call it shockmovie. A firefight means that a hero can enter an open field with 10 people shooting at him, collect a gun, start shooting and don't get hurt. <br /> <br /> The story is empty, the boy wakes up, he has lost his memory, he starts to fight because that's what he's good at. Five years later the memories return, he takes revenge on blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth it, it's not really worth your time if you're not drunk and bored.
