Gung Ho was a good idea, but it is a lot to ask American viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition. In this film, the protagonist Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese automobile company to come to America and help his dying city of Pennslyvania. Two things come to you. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do it, and so well? Secondly, can anyone understand that American companies of all types are turning to third world nations so that their products are escaped from the cost of American labor? Therefore, the premise of the film is that the number one car manufacturer in the world would go to one of its main competitors (apart from Germany) and put an installation there as unrealistic. Keaton was still on his way to comedy right now. But it gives a believable performance the same that could prove that it could go from comedy to drama in a few seconds and not get embarrassed, but director Ron Howard cannot prevent it from becoming a TV movie that ends up being anyway because they have to give to the unlikely story a happy ending that politics and the problems of Japanese and American relations do not resist. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel like the producers of both TV shows have made the film and then even made the TV version of this film that gives the film its light appearance. The Japanese manager falls in love with his American workers and feels that he and the other Japanese can learn from the Americans. The man n. 2 Saito that presumably he doesn't like Americans, he doesn't think so. I would have preferred that all the Japanese characters were like Saito rather than the soft goofball characters that made the Japanese become. It would have made the film more interesting.
