This film is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, from around 1997, seems to be the absolute best: making a film on a film a year before its release and not coming with a quality film. I'm not a film critic, but this film was as predictable as them. Every joke attempt, every attempt to touch a moment and the painful attempt at a love story, was exactly what I was predicting in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this.
