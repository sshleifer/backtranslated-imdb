I took it at a screening test. All I can say is: what ... the ... devil? This film runs smoothly like Mickey Mouse by reading the script for "Scarface". It is bizarre as well as giving the slightest sense; and even if you leave your brain in the car, the film is still so bizarre that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to "save" a crocodile that contains a CIA probe. The CIA arrives after Irwin has their probe back, Irwin has mistaken them for the poachers and decides to "stop them". <br /> <br /> It is all the history there is; the rest is an exaggerated flash of Australian culture ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strange choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin mounts an accelerated RV and knife fighting with a CIA agent on it. Yes, that's right: the Steve Irwin knife fights a guy on top of a camper. Let it be your guide to this incredibly ugly movie.
