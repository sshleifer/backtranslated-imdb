I've seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was an honest endeavor considering the expectations of following such a success which is Grey's Anatomy. So I kept watching. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, chemistry and, most importantly, the drama of its predecessor Grey's Anatomy. Relationships seem artificial and acting is so-so. Writing lacks intelligence and comic suggestions seen in GA. There are shows that are a formula but they do not feel formal and invented, unfortunately the PP is not so. I loved the presence of Kate Walsh in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in Los Angeles isn't just interesting.
