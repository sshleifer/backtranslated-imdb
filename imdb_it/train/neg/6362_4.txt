I'm a big fan of Italian films of the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses of all time, so I went into this film with some hopes. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a largely useless film that will not go anywhere. Clearly nobody would go in this aspect much more, but the fact that this is useless becomes more annoying when it is considered that it is also rather boring and none of the characters is interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a "thief"; in this case one who steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. This is basically the whole plot of this movie. The film has a true "seventies style" and the idea that everything is very carefree gets along. Sometimes it seems that directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson are trying to express some kind of point, even if whatever it is, it doesn't look very good. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and here too it is; she's definitely the best thing about the movie and the sequence in which she hangs on a naked machine is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal for people who love seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much else to offer.
