I gave this film a rating of 1 (Terrible). The only reason he should also get a 1 instead of a big -0- is Ben Kingsley, who always shines and it doesn't matter what terrible material is thrown in his way. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so far from its element here as a spectator you cannot simply overcome the fact that it is also in that piece. Stupid, stupid story and horrible production. DO NOT waste your video rental $.
