Saving Grace is certainly one of the main contenders for the "How to Ruin a Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes" award. Of course, if you mix a picturesque Cornish village - largely populated by retired stately ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of stupidity will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film come down in a totally ridiculous way and are not even redeemed being particularly funny. It's a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to live up to the 1998 Waking Ned Devine, which also played a picturesque village and the extravagant inhabitants trying to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose legacy of her husband's bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of making money. Helped by his gardener, Matthew transforms his horticultural experience into the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her to confront the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . which all occur simultaneously in its greenhouse. The relationship and the relationship between Grace and Matthew are well represented, and Brenda Blethyn emotionally involves the viewer with her cute character - you can really feel what she is going through. <br /> <br /> The casting of minor roles is excellent, although some of them are rather eccentric eccentrics. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the film at all. And surely hydroponics is not a revolution in the world of cannabis cultivation? Unfortunately the film exchanges a gentle humor for slapstick and ends up being as false as the marijuana plants.
