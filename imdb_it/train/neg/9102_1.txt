I was willing to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ It went on with the plot and remained faithful to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this film was, in my opinion, a crumissimo rehash with essentially the same plot and no clear choices of character. I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) are the characters and their interactions, not the same events. I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this film had to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number "2", I was expecting a sequel, but then I decided it had to be a piece to accompany. Above all, I must say that this film has read, at least for me, as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I wasn't impressed
