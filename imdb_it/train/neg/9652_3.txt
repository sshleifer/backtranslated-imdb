The film was written 10 years ago and a different director was designing it with SRK and Aamir in the main roles <br /> <br /> The film was finally made with Vipul Shah who directed him E Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM (1999) <br /> <br /> The film falls anyway due to the manageability of the 90s and the loopholes are worse <br /> <br /> The film tries to pack too many commercial ingredients and we too have the love triangle <br /> <br /> Everything is predictable, filmed and too cliche <br /> <br /> There are loopholes as Ajay flees London airport and makes a place for himself with anyone? even the way his band starts is not convincing The second part improves with the turning point in the story of Ajay that destroys Salman but unfortunately the climax falls and the film ends in a bad note <br /> <br /> Direction by Vipul Shah is ordinary below average. Music is the worst point, most of the songs are mediocre. <br /> <br /> Among the actors Ajay gives his best, even if he is not convincing as a rock singer, yet is superb as the negative role of Salman however irritates with his punjabi and speaks nonsense, impresses only when he is drugged and on it Asin is nothing exceptional only a piece of the show Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is fine
