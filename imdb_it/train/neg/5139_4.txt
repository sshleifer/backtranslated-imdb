A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I found it rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag on so much. I think the main problem is that everything is set in the dark. Sometimes horror movies set in the dark can work (like Humongous), but Scarecrows is in the dark throughout the movie. It is often difficult to understand what is really going on, and although some scarecrow shots were disturbing, most were hard to see. If a little more lighting had been used, maybe it would have been better. <br /> <br /> There aren't many movies that involve scarecrow killers, apart from my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend it on Scarecrow every day.
