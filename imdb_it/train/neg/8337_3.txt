Millie is a sap. She marries a rich boy named Maitland and they have a son. She then surprises him by betraying her and divorcing him ... but allows him to keep the child he claims to love. At the time, in the early 1930s, he would have been entitled to great marital and child support, but he left the boy incredibly easy ... without support ... that sucks! Later, when he has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to be a cheat too! Wow, you have trouble choosing men. <br /> <br /> As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she is a wild girl, doing all she can to distract herself from her misfortune. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter, who left early in the film, is now 17 and strangely the fashions haven't changed a bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, he is another evil man!) He is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lascivious designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she will kill him. Try to guess what will happen next! <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is a confused and often bizarre mess - a bit like "Madam X" but much, much less concentrated. Very often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And the film seems to have a bit of everything thrown into it, as long as it supports the idea that all men are pigs. Unusual but not particularly good.
