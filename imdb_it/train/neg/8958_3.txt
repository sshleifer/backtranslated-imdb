I didn't really like the first Cube movie. It was a good idea, but acting and annoying characters have always kept me from enjoying it too much. I didn't really feel the need to see his sequel, but when I heard they were making a third film that would have been more of a prequel than the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would solve some of the original's problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters. Well, I thought it was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts pretty well by introducing us with the two characters in charge of observing and maintaining the infinite maze of traps that plagues people in the Cube. The directors manage to provide a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine. From it various questions are created regarding the reason why people are sent there and also the true nature of those who manage the whole operation. All this is left entirely to the viewer. The acting was a bit weak but all in all the first half of the film moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> With history in motion, one of the two "observers" begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing. And later he decided to go and help a group of trapped people. This is where it all starts to dissolve quickly into boring cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the people who run the Cube program, we are presented with the "Jax" character. Together with his two subjects he underlines an important reason why this film is a failure. The beginning of "Jax" seems and speaks more of a third-rate villain taken directly from a James Bond film complete with the "popular" glass eye, which alone ruins any atmosphere created by the relatively pleasant rhythm of the first half . What's more is that it starts to feel more like a comedy than a serious film. With some incredibly malign lines, perhaps the writer was bored and didn't care. The same acting degrades further when the former "observer" meets the group in the Cube. The whole interaction is painful to look at and everything else follows it. <br /> <br /> Once again they fail to impress anything except the weak characters, "Cube Zero" dialogue and acting is a waste of time for those looking for a good horror movie.
