Look at the original with the same title of 1944! This fact for TV movies is simply terrible! Although you use (as far as I know) almost the same dialog, it just doesn't work! Is it acting, bad direction? OK, so it's made for TV, but why look at a bad copy when you get your hands on the superb original? Especially because you will be spoiled by the plot and you won't like the original so much, as if you had seen it before! <br /> <br /> There are some things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but they're all worse! The actors who play the parts here simply don't fit the bill! Can't believe it and who could interpret Edward G. Robinsons's original performance? If you want, look at it only after seeing the original and even then you will be very brave if you look through it! It's almost a sacrilege!
