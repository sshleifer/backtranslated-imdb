'Blue Desert' may have had the potential to be even halfway plausible and the most entertaining thriller was the protagonist, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When he is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, the comic artist Roberts moves to a small town to the west. In his early days there he meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, playing this part well) who eventually won't leave his part. Fearing for his safety after having been in the situation twice before, he established a friendship and a relationship with the suspiciously friendly policeman, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose character does not seem convincing enough, leaving disbelief to viewers who otherwise should be convinced of the red herrings thrown by writers). Smith needs Roberts's collaboration because, as he tells her, Atkins is a former prisoner and guilty of sexual violence. But the cops lack the evidence to put it off before. <br /> <br /> The film has had enough tricks to make at least one movie interesting because soon enough, there is such confusion about who should trust Roberts. However, much of the expected suspense seems too forced because the character of Roberts never seems to react to simple things like we think any reasonable person can. And his delayed answers allow much of that suspense to present itself easily and unconvincingly, particularly in the finale. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; too small in front in a way reminiscent of the personality of Kevin Anderson evident in his character in "Sleeping with the enemy". Or, if Lisa Roberts had been written as a stronger character, that too could be enough. Meanwhile, the film is not that great, not even as a low-cost B thriller.
