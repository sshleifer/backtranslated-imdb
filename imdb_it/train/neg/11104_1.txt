I'm not one of those people who go online after watching a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made. If you doubt me, please look at my other reviews. However, for the first time ever, I saw a film so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it ended. <br /> <br /> I LOVE bad movies. For me, Ed Wood is a genius, I thought Bloody Murder, Jeepers Creepers and the most horrible horror film were good. However, there is not a single positive thing I can say about this film. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically non-existent. If someone who reads my review wastes their money to see it, they can discern for themselves what the plot might be, but I suggest that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects are bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad. <br /> <br /> The two protagonists are attractive, but that's all there is. <br /> <br /> I'm not the type to ruin a movie for anyone, but I INVITE anyone to write to me at foxbarking@yahoo.com to ask for my opinion on this film before wasting a penny on it. I'll tell you anything. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies, and I love horror and I love inventive new films. I also like horror movies like Hostel (which some reviewers claimed was, but obviously they only thought it because Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2). But this could be the most useless and stupid number 1 movie ever created. <br /> <br /> And before ignoring this review, this comes from someone who not only participated in the House of the Dead INTERNATIONAL but actually bought a copy.
