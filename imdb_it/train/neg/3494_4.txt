Considering his popularity, I found this film a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie. After all, it's one of the most popular martial arts movies of the 70s, but I never understood why. The story is not interesting. It is also a very talkative film with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the film was that the story doesn't offer a character for which I could root, since the designated hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and is unable to hide the obvious imperfections found in the narrative. I know this should not be a high art, but I found the film boring. Surely it is not the best example of this genre so beloved. His cult status escapes me. I suggest you skip it.
