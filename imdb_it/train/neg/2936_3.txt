I too was intrigued by the high rating (8.5) of this film, and I was very disappointed. I had just seen a couple of good foreign films and couldn't wait to make three in a row, but it wasn't. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. There is not much plot, if it exists. I don't necessarily need it in a movie, but it needs to entertain or get me in. The best I could say would be that it aspires to be an Altman movie, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. Of course, there are moments, but a few moments can easily be diluted by a slow 97 minutes of nothing. I don't understand the high rating of this film. I give him a 3. <br /> <br />
