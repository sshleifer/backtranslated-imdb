Reed Diamond plays a man who suffers from amnesia who has been in an asylum for over a decade after he was found to be asking for back roads with blood on his hands. The doctors want to test a new experimental drug that will return its lost memories if it works. But when drugs give him the hallucinations of a demon, he chooses instead to escape. While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother, he will not leave her near the darkroom in his basement and behaves wary in general. <br /> <br /> While the general "mystery" of the film is a bit easy to identify before it is revealed, I have found that the acting of Mr. Diamond is so compelling to keep my attention everywhere. (In the interest of a complete revelation, I have been a great fan of his since Homicide and his short but extremely important role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a great film or a good movie, but quite useful. Although I liked it better than the previous films I saw from director / screenwriter Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: a fleeting pair of tits in a hallucination <br / > <br /> My Grade: C-
