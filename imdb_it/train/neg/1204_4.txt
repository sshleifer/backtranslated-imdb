I remember that Devil Dog played on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends looked at him and laughed all the next day. It is not so bad for a horror movie created for TV, but it is derived (mainly from The Exorcist) and professional, due to the lack of a better word. It won't leave you speechless with artistic cinematography or great acting, but it's not even a waste of time. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you're not in the mood to think too much. <br /> <br /> However, if you go into the film in search of laughter, you win "be disappointed The first scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog like a cute puppy with the children of the damn eyes, are hilarious and non-threatening, and the climatic effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) They are pretty split. And keep an eye on the Satanist cloaked with the shades of Maverick in the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is not a great film of the horror from any part of the imagination, but I wish they still did things like that for TV.
