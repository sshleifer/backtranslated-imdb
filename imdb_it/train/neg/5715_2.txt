'Say Yes' is one of those films that you keep hoping will improve, but it never does. He's the kind of "psychopath without reason who decides to threaten an innocent couple", so much loved by video directors. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is clumsy and, in several places, poorly translated. The acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice he is making his character appear threatening, when all he really does is make it look a little simple. <br /> <br /> The plot deserves a special mention, as it is idiotic beyond belief. The "heroes" do not think it too odd that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The heroine twice fails to see the villain when he is no more than a meter from her. The villain passes a police checkpoint (while wearing a blood covered shirt and a bloody head bandage) showing the cops a burned body in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is stabbed, struck with a shovel and stuck with a pitchfork, but he never seems to be hindered by these rather serious injuries. And don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only extra point in this film for me is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very nice, but actually no more than a mediocre actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film looks like a poorly written, copious and foolishly directed attempt to copy "The Hitcher" and "Spoorloos", but fails at every corner due to the lack of talent in all involved subjects.
