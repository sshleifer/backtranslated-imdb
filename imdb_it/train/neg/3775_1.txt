As other users have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. Colors are in bold. I think the director was taken away with his "artistic vision" with respect to the appearance of the film, instead of paying attention to the much needed content. Despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story almost incoherent. Madonna was probably chosen as a feat to get a pre-release print. A positive aspect as his appearance here gave some credit to his album "I'm Breathless (Music inspired by the movie Dick Tracy)" which was a stratospheric success (due in large part to the inclusion of successful "Vogue" it is not, nor has the slightest relation to this film). I guess most of the money from this movie comes from the tie-ins on Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you look at it at home, from the end credits, you will do it "there are two hours of my life that I would like to have back." Save yourself the lost time - don't worry about it.
