Guy Richie's third film (not counting the terrible "Swept Away" is a complex action thriller based on gambling, gangsters and chess. Fans of previous attempts by Richie will probably hate Revolver as much as I do, with his twists and turns The wealthy supporter Jason Statham plays Jake, a former scammer who just came out, to take revenge on the ridiculously called Dorothy Macha (a superb OTT Ray Liotta), but instead gets involved with a couple of other cons, one of whom is Andre 3000 from the Outkast rap) who launch us and us the public, a series of false strings in the film, everything becomes extremely boring. The highest point of this chaos of a film is the part of the restaurant, where dialogue turns in favor of a superbly shooting and slow-motion shooting set at Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata: all in all, Revolver is imperfect work , not really horrible but far from the best of Richie, would still be Lock, Stock. If this film were a task for school assignments it would make it be ranked 'must try harder!'
