This film was almost intolerable to sit on. I can go beyond the fact that it looks like it was shot with a home video camera and that this film should last for weeks, but the characters don't change their clothes once, but the acting tore up the 4th wall. I saw him play better in a 4th grade game. Apart from that, the plot is not realistic. If the man suspected that the boy would transform him, I was also deeply disappointed that all the killings had been done with a gun, what kind of blood is that. This is not a script that the Zodiac did not kill using just a gun, the authorities would have known it was not him. Another thing that really bothered me is that they called DSM 4 Disassociative Identity Disorder when this is the name of the book used to diagnose people with mental disorders, not the name of the disorder. Overall, I think this film is not the kind of movie that could be made on a low budget, at least not as low as them, or that they could make sure they had better actors or more gore. A lot of people have chosen the low budget route without having to use horrible actors to watch Easy Rider who had Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson and a low budget.
