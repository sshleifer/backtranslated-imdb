The film begins with a scrolling text that takes about five minutes. Provides the basic summary of what is happening. This could easily be done with acting, but instead you get a scrolling text effect. Soon after you were bombarded with characters you learn something, keep in mind that this is EVERYTHING you will learn about them. The plot starts to take off and then crashes through the entire movie. The plot doesn't just change, but you might even ask yourself if you're watching the same movie. I've never played video games, but I know people who have. From my understanding that you've ever played or not, this movie doesn't improve. Save your money unless you like sleeping in cinemas.
