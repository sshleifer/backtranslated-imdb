This film was disgusting. Theirs should be a warning that a sadistic sadistic writer is trying to make a name for himself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching the garbage. What is garbage? The abuse of people's time, the abuse of energy and the waste of any kind of educational system that taught them to read and write. Talia you are a sick loser demented. Your psychiatrist must prescribe stronger drugs for your problem. <br /> <br /> The acting and the plot gave me no choice but to advance quickly through the garbage. I ended up in a scene that I didn't like. If you want to learn how to shock people, watch a Larry Clark movie. I have lost all respect for the entire cast of this film "there is no more support from me". How could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior are manifested by the mind of a psychopath? I'm sorry for all the actors who took part in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the writer of this film is; congratulations you won his attention.
