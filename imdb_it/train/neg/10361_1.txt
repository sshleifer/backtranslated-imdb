This straight-to-TV failure of ABC does absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Ms. Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into a magical, fantastic and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first of his "temporal quartet", is a beautiful interpretation of life, of the universe and of time itself. Yet it is easy for every child or adolescent to understand. His unshakable morality is prevalent throughout the book. This film adaptation can only be seen as a mockery of Mrs L'Engle's artwork. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects seem cheap and ridiculous, the plot is mushy and irregular, the dialogue is unlikely and almost all the magical features of the novel have been lost. This was a horrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that one day an intelligent and worthy director (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) will make another attempt to bring this book to the screen and understand it for what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to boring, fake and cheap hotel room furniture that has no basis and has absolutely no impact on its audience.
