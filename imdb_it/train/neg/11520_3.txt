I didn't like this movie at all. For one, I found it crude and vulgar, for no reason. I also thought he was a misogynist (against women). Besides, the film doesn't really seem to be anything, and I haven't found any of the cute characters. Really, there doesn't seem to be any point where anything could be missing, but for me, this movie is pretty much a waste of time, when it could have done something more productive and enjoyable. How to use my face as a pin. James Garner is in this thing, as are C. Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell. Everyone is wasted here, and I'm sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers. Jennilee Harrison (of the last years of Three's Company) is also in the film, and it's nice to see her in a non-ditsy role. But beyond that, she can t over the mediocre script. For me, Tank is a 3/10
