I actually saw this movie, I didn't expect much, I got it in a pack of 5 movies, which were all pretty terrible in their own way for less than a five, so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has some (and some are lengthening it) interesting points, the occasional view of the camera is a nice touch, the drummer is very similar to a drummer, that is damn annoying and In Actually, the problem is that it's just so boring, in what I can only think was an attempt to create tension, nothing happens and when it does it's absolutely boring (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for the most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the singer of the band that great at big, because they don't say half of how good he is hell, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I won't go in there either, it's not worth explaining. However, as far as I'm concerned, Star and London are the only reason to see it and with the exception of London (which was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've seen a lot worse, but I've also seen much better. Better to avoid unless you are bored watching the dry paint.
