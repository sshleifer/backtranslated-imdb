I voted 3 for this film because it's perfect as is the output of Greenaways. However, it was his usual mix of "artistic" sex and pretentious fiction. I know a lot of people like this movie, but I got tired very quickly. It's definitely not for everyone. The omnipresent McGregor obviously took the part for credibility, I think, but in reality he shouldn't have wasted his time. I hate to deliver someone to the pseud corner, but please ..... !!! The positive side is visually very attractive and I liked the music but I couldn't see it until the end and I can't say it for many movies. I usually watch everything but this is unbearable !!
