I was attracted by the title ... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I had a rather boring and uninteresting story about a turbulent Scottish. <br /> <br /> The protagonist does not have much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify poetry as adolescents like psychology. <br /> <br /> It was a pity, because the core of the story could be good, with a better effort to describe the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the general idea seems to be more like "I am the way I am because I am like this". And the ridiculous attempt to give a kind of poetic advantage to a man of the lower class makes things even worse. Making use of the overwhelming cliché of the "poète maudit" stinks of a quick solution, a cheap way to make a boring movie seem intelligent, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not very intelligent, artistic or meaningful ... The main character does not evolve at all and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just as the initial attempt happened rather unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The film heavily borrows classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but ultimately fails to regain their greatness, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson has given too much emphasis to the artistic side of the story, and has neglected the rest, giving us a film that is pleasing to the eye but insipid to the brain.
