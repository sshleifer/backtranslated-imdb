This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD was given to me for free with an order I placed online for non-DVD items. No wonder they were given away, surely no one could split up with the money for this drivel. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers may say they found it hilarious beggar beliefs, the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it right. <br /> <br /> How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could be involved in this garbage is incredible. Mostly humor in the toilets and badly done. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to be entertained should avoid it at all costs.
