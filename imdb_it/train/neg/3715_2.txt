The black guy becomes rich white boy, and the rich white guy seems to embrace hip-hop culture, and most of the "funny" moments of this movie play out of this. The problem I have is that it doesn't work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> OK, so no one would expect Lance to catch such a body and suddenly start behaving like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I'll grant it. But at the same time, it goes beyond the other direction. Should I imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely turning things upside down, playing like he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people * simply * accept it? And what about Sontee, who falls in love with him * like a rich white boy *, even if he doesn't care about his money or his power? This is so absolutely incredible that it's not even funny. <br /> <br /> I could not suspend disbelief and could not finish the film. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even with difficulty, a couple of times. But I just couldn't get over the whole "white guy doing hip hop" thing that was never done well in any movie I've ever seen. This was not an exception.
