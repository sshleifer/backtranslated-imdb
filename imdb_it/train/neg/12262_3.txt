Fans of creature films have to endure a lot of terrible movies lately. Blood Surf unashamedly joins the list of stupid and redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously large animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. The crocodiles are particularly successful because we have already had to fight through the abysmal 'Coccodrillo' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is as bad as these other movies and ?? what's more ?? loves to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old, over 30 feet long (!) And kills for fun! During the film, he enjoys devouring a group of completely stupid surfers and dudettes who have come to look for new emotions by surfing in an area congested by sharks. The only beautiful aspect of this film is the tropical location. Although it is a completely inadequate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature are wonderful. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There is a bit of cold blood but everything looks fake and ridiculous. The dialogues are definitely painful to hear! You won't believe some of the phrases that these actors have to say! I know surfers should be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope they're not that stupid for them! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as a "mechanical toy", but the croc here seems at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects of 'Blood Surf' are amateur and the massacres cannot impress. I won't say too much about acting as it's secondary in movies like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their tits bounce with joy as they escape from the beast. You guessed it: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad it becomes fun again. But "funny" for a completely different reason than James Hickox intended.
