This film had a good premise: 9 people who face their fears to win a million dollars. Unfortunately, it wasn't a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and really useless like the dance scene. Some scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at parts of the female body. Acting is bad, but some of the lines are fun in their terribleness. The really strange thing is that towards the end of the film it turns into a 5-minute western, and in the end, the twists, of which they were different, make no sense with the rest of the film. It seemed as if the director added something around because he thought it would be nice, while he was properly ignoring the plot of the film up to that point. It didn't make much sense. The only gruesome thing was the old people dancing along the corridor, but this doesn't even come close to remedying the rest of this mess.
