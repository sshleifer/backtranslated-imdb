1st seen 5/27/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir - Harold Young): The third film of the Universal mummy is almost the same as the first two for the final result from the viewer's point of view. The story is similar and the result is a ho-hum. This time the story is set in the United States, while the new follower of the Egyptian priest sends a mummy to our country in the hope that he can revive it to kill the descendants of those who opened the original tomb. This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney (which doesn't make much difference because he isn't really required to play much for this character). The new priest becomes a morgue in the city and sends his mother out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the juice of leaves. Once again, a girl intrudes, while the priest falls in love with one of the descendant's boyfriends and wants her, yes --- to be immortal with him (have we never heard of him before?). The plan is obviously hindered while the citizens hunt the mummy with torches (similar to the Frankenstein monster) and the burning of the creature ends the story ... how do they get a sequel? I guess you'll find out with the next one in the series ?? or not.....
