Films like these are for the originals what the album-oriented Rock stations are for what the music was once - repetitive, boring and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones. I'm glad that Aragorn was not typified as a psychologist waiting for this P.O.S. Go back and look at the 1971 version, count the things that would never be included in a modern version, and thank any divinity you love that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original conceptual film that was not based on someone else's ideas, and was not passed through a board of directors before it saw the light of day.
