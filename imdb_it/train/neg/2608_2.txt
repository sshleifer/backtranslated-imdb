My 10 year old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just a repetition of things from "101 Dalmatians". I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The best part was the credits at the beginning - they were nice and well made. The rest of the film is not worth watching. Thank you.
