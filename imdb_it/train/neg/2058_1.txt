I can find very little to say about this film. I'm sure the idea and script seemed good on paper, but the filmography and acting I fear are not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I doubt this works much in their CV Filmography. Michael Caine appeared in wood sometimes in his role as a Doctor, and at no time did I actually believe in his character. The plot was incredible especially with regards to the child of the victims. Some scenes were very reminiscent of other films, sometimes I wondered if it was a real thriller. The lighting was sometimes dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big stars, wondering why I had bothered to watch it for nothing.
