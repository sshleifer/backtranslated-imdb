For those who would like to see this movie? I would say: go! Without the narration it could be a great film / documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented plots make it very difficult to see a skeptical person like me. Following different animals, their life in different seasons has the feeling that it is an animal soap that we are looking at. But the melodramatic point of view doesn't do it for me, besides if a predator finally reaches a prey (an exception remained there) the camera zooms out or jumps on another scene. I wonder why it happens, if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that remains a melodramatic fairy tale? I think morality is important for the mass of the crowd, after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
