Much of "Over Her Dead Body" is so painfully little fun that I was really wiggling on my seat due to embarrassment for the actors. <br /> <br /> Eva Longoria proves that she can't bring a movie in this terrible romantic comedy, and besides, that she doesn't really have any comic timing. She is as irritating and irritating as a ghost that returns to earth to keep a kitchen psychic from engagement with her boyfriend. The boyfriend is played by Paul Rudd, lively and devoid of charm, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the film to any anemic energy he has. I felt very sorry for Bell, as he seems to have some comic abilities and was working overtime trying to make the material work. Unfortunately, she is opposed to the insurmountable task of making any film that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and is dragged down by the rest of the cast as Leo DiCaprio at the end of "Titanic". <br /> <br /> "Over Her Dead Body" actually disappointed me, due to his laziness and total lack of effort. I started thinking about all the interesting projects that can't be funded because huge amounts of money are channeled into bland junk like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid are they to think it's the cinema audience? <br /> <br /> Vote: F
