I had read some positive reviews of this film, and I was really surprised how terrible it all was. Positioned as a cross between an AIDS-related story and a sort of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" story, this film cannot always make you think of what it wants to be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous sex (even if secure) on the side whenever he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon no longer seem to have sex. When Mark dies, Simon - who has got into the habit of interrupting his emotions after being rejected by his father years ago - tries to erase his memory and continue to be a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Mark returns in a ghostly form and foils his various encounters, while causing Simon to open up and admit his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to empathize most of the film with him. The moment he should be more understanding, it's too late to worry. Mark, on the other hand, follows in the footsteps of Demi Moore from "Ghost", crying profusely throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre change of tone after Mark is back. All of a sudden we get some lame attempts at humor, a "haunted" television show. But this does not last long. Once Simon's emotional health is brought into play, the whole thing becomes more and more sloppy, with amateur attempts to jerk the strings of the heart. The ending, with a muscled gold plated boy angel driving a tearful Mark into the sky while a chastened and pained Simon greets the waves is simply amazing, especially since it is not intentionally funny.
