Mark Pirro's "Deathrow Gameshow" of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely poor in many parts, but sometimes very funny. This film could certainly have been much better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely poor scenes make it difficult to watch sometimes, but the concept is fun, and has some hilarious moments. <br /> <br /> the near future (1991), the game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a show called "Live Or Die", in which condemned men condemned to death have the opportunity to play for their lives and for money. Failed candidates are killed in the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs and others, more bizarre execution devices, followed by applause from the festive public. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made many enemies ... <br /> <br /> "Deathrow Gameshow" is incredibly shoddy and lousy in many respects, and the acting is terrible, but it is without doubt fun in many parts, especially if you are a fan of dark humor. You didn't miss anything if you didn't see it, but it's definitely fun and a good waste of time. 4/10
