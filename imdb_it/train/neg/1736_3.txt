Let me tell you that I really liked Betty Grable, particularly from "Down Argentine Way", but when it came to this disaster, she also "turned" and frankly the whole movie was embarrassing. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been desperate enough) the story was ugly, the colors good, and the film too long. There were some of the old standbys like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try to stimulate interest but without success. The soundtrack was painful, and I have to say that no melody was memorable in any way ... since I was such a Miss Grable fan, I always wish I had never seen it!
