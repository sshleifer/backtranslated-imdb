I don't believe all the praise for this movie. The comedy and the film were a hangover from Sleuth. Michael Caine wants to be Olivier and Reeves wants to be Cain. Caine even had the courage to do a remake of Sleuth with Jude Law playing his original part. Jude Law? Do you mean what the "Alfie" remake did? <br /> <br /> This film was made during a period of Caine's career when it was obvious he had to pay gambling debts. He would do anything for money. He would perform in such award-winning films as "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure". What seems to be a source of praise for this film is the death of Reeves. He deserves better than being remembered for this lousy movie. And also Caine. This movie can be found in the $ 5.97 basket at Walmart. Along with gems like "The Island" and "Blame it on Rio".
