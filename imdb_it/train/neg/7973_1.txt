I go to a lot of movies, I often take my 5-year-old son, I'm so glad I didn't take him to this. There are many references to sex and a meager dive scene, however, this is not the main reason why I wouldn't take it with me. The trailers lead you to believe that it is a carefree comedy; however, practically all the fun moments are in the previews. I kept waiting for it to become interesting, funny or anything but serious; however, I almost fell asleep while the plotless story dragged on. I understand that dogs can be a great company, that being said, the whole story focused on a poorly educated dog that the owners weren't expert enough to train. If a human being had caused so much damage and chaos, that person would have been banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of talent. The best way to summarize this film is that the couple becomes an unruly dog, the couple falls in love with a dog, a dog dies, a sad couple. The end.
