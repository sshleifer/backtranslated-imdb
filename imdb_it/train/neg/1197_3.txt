They really can't get any more stupid than this movie about 3 losers trying to capture the spirit of college during the annual spring break holidays in many of our high school learning institutions. The problem is that these losers are trying to do it 15 years after their college years, when one is tasked with supervising a senator's daughter prepared to be the next vice president. <br /> <br /> The problem is that you daughter is anything but popular, but obviously it comes out. The girls go through drunken rage, exotic dances and other absolute nonsense. <br /> <br /> It can't really be much worse than this horrible movie.
