We actually saw him twice in the theater because we couldn't believe how bad it was the first time. Maybe we missed something ... no, what's missing is since the beginning of pre-production. Actually, I went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I found out that what I thought was fun and exciting about that day is now just a disconnected and confused junk. <br /> <br /> So the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it, and the rest of the train disaster progressed from there. Absolutely nothing works, not a blessed thing. Some nice outdoor photography is steamrolled by the random positioning of the cameras in the internal shots. All the actors seem at least uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson seems positively mortified - with the exception of Rain Phoenix, which gives the impression of being too unconscious to realize how horrible her performance is. Dialogue is one, long, resolute cringe. The scenes do not make sense from the second to the second, and the connections between them are non-existent. Still, the film stumbles blindly, convinced that it is saying something profound. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to be fun too; it's just atrocious. Gus Van Zant has made other good-big films that I encourage you to see, and I'm glad he survived (and seems to have learned from) this mess.
