great mystery, but the film comes from there. The beginning is promising with a car accident and a woman and her daughter are burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized by this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter comes from an old girl who asks for help to find her missing daughter. Thus Ed travels to a common island mainly of women. They don't like strangers. A lot of filling is with Ed shown looking in town for the girl. This made the film too long. Finally he gets closer to the crazy rituals that the woman performs and finally the sinister plan in store for Edward. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a well written and too long story. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: I would like to skip this.
