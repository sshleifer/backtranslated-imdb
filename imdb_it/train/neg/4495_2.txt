Following are spoilers of both this and The Matrix. <br /> <br /> I really liked the original Matrix. It was not a profound film, despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize, but it was quite stimulating, amusing, and I have a weakness for Hong Kong's struggles. <br /> <br /> In the original, Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy Anderson cube. By day, corporate drone and at night, brave hacker. In the end, he is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - he becomes an outlaw who fights against the car, or returns to the safe and forgettable world from which he started. Interestingly, he finds that once he has no illusions, life rather sucks. He has his girlfriend by his side and his fellow charities, but he eats sodas, sweatshirts and lives in a really ramshackle piece of car. However, the truth makes it free. <br /> <br /> At least part of the fun of that first movie lies in the questions "what would happen if I were" raised in the mind of the viewer. And if I had succeeded in the impossible? What happens if I were "The One". It doesn't even matter what you are The only example of, with an interesting title like that. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Agent Smith made a wonderful bad boy, for he embodied all the fear of the authority we carry with us. He was unstoppable as a terminator and ruthless. <br /> <br /> At the end of the Matrix, Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom. <br /> <br /> This the film fails to completely complete the ideas of the original film, and it does so with such a lack of taste, with such poor writing and such poor editing that I can't believe they have planned these changes. When the dialogue is at the fifth level, with various long words dropped randomly, I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying. <br /> <br /> My short list of characterization errors: <br /> <br /> The oracle goes from slightly useful, if deceptive to completely obstructive without a real reason. <br /> <br /> The main "personalities" of the matrix are introduced without necessity - the keymaster, for example, was a nice idea, but not really an interesting character. <br /> <br /> Fishburne loses its role as "advisor" and gets nothing to replace it. <br /> <br /> Isn't the people of Zion particularly nice, and would you not really want them to run the world? <br /> <br /> Special effects problems: <br /> <br /> Combat scenes are useless and intermittent. In The Matrix, you heard that Neo could lose and that he had to become something bigger to survive. In The Matrix Reloaded, it is simply the point of view of a particularly ill-conceived video game. <br /> <br /> Highway combat seemed very false, and not so interesting. <br /> <br /> Pacing problems. <br /> <br /> As I said above, the fighting scenes were endless. <br /> <br /> The rave went on too long - everyone in my line at the theater was watching the clock. Not because we deal with good dances and good orgies, but because we didn't know about the people in the picture, nor did we care. <br /> <br /> Whatever the written trick, the soliloquy of the creator should be blacklisted by the business. It meant, he used words that the writer clearly didn't understand, and it was a waste of time and a crazy killer. The creator's speech could have been made in a tenth of the time and with more dangers such as "Zion exists to give the rebels a place to go so they don't destroy the Matrix." There are now too many people who do not believe, the matrix is ​​in danger of crashing and killing every person connected to it. Also, the earth cannot support even the people in Zion, not to mention these others. You can choose a person from Zion to form the new Zion, while cleaning up people's memories in the Matrix right now. "<br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long twinddle group. If someone claims it is profound, ask for a transcript and try to break down the sentences. Each is too long for multiple clauses and uses words with clearer synonyms. and shorter. <br /> <br /> So in summary, it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I've seen the third, and despite what a number of reviewers have said, skip it. save this turkey. <br /> <br /> Reviewers who believe the second and third films were "profound" should go see some really profound films. Maybe read a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and maybe a bit of philosophy. This film is not difficult to understand, but it is difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> Scott
