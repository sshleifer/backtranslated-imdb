I saw the Unrated version of this movie and realized about 30 minutes that I never had time to recover. Lost to the end hoping the dialogue would improve, the martial arts finally seemed realistic, the special FX would be really special. I was so wrong. I love Horror, I'm a blood-filled hound. I know some of the movies about the eighties splatters among the greats of the film world. However, this was not done in the 1980s, if this film was released in the early 1980s, the telefax could be forgiven for looking so bad. He wasn't like that he didn't have that defense. The dialogue is terrible, with so many nasty lines that I started for writing rather than writhing in torture. I don't like the hostel, I never did it, I thought it was over, exaggerated and I didn't feel anything for the protagonists, but it shines like a beacon for greatness next to this garbage. The back of the Live Feed cover promised a turning point you would never see coming, I'm still waiting for the promise that was promised.
