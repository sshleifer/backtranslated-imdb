Here is an independent film that I really wanted a lot, but in the end couldn't. The lack of script (boldly proclaimed in the main titles) really shows and kills the image. History is a meaningless disaster that is not worth trying to understand. I quickly got bored in 10 minutes, then I suffered for the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before hitting the chapters of the chapters for (mercifully) coming to the end ... this was also not worth the effort. OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be intelligent, raising its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in OZARK SAVAGE that has never been done before, and better. This movie would have been much more fun as a short 10-20 minutes, but as a feature, it feels just stuffed and forced. Of course, there is no money in shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons I assume motivated to be extended to 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and I wish him luck.
