On Christmas Eve the lazy and submissive housewife Della (Kim Basinger) receives some violent threats from her tormented and violent husband. Leaving his twins in bed, he ventures into the night for a last binge in the local mall. He is busy there and finding a parking space is almost impossible, Della teases a motorist who parks in two spaces, she leaves them a note that says a lot. Returning to her car after visiting the shops, she confronted some yob, Yup, the car owners, left a note, they are very angry and want to have fun with her, a kind security guard intervenes to help her, but the things are done By hand and the guard is shot, Della escapes with the horrible pursuing murders, they shoot her, she loses control of her car and crashes, quickly grabbing her toolbox from the trunk, hides in an abandoned construction site , but is soon captured, just before they try to rape and kill her, from his magic toolbox he produces a wrench, wounding their leader "Chuckie", manages to escape back into the nearby woods, one of the gang is killed in the brawl , it just happens to be the black guy Here the night gets worse for all those involved as a result of a deadly cat and mouse game. A plot similar to Eden Lake drew me to this, but this is where the comparisons end. This is a mindless and foolish film, shockingly scripted and horribly played by everyone involved, the twin Disney-esquire twins are horrible to look at, but its Lukas Haas in the role of Chuckie, who must take applause in the department of bad acting, although he is given a run for his money by her equally terrible husband. As a film, his plot is completely wired to the end, even in the early set up, Della's cell phone is dead and then her credit card has been canceled by her hubby in stores and she has no cash and her Christmas Eve , now where could they go with this I wonder ??? The only surprising part of this $ success is when, after killing all the bad clich√©s with the contents of his magic toolbox, he asks Chuckie about f @ ck, if my jaw hadn't already been on the floor in this terrible movie, surely he would have fallen and crashed on the floor. also the ending is messed up, all the feminist grandmothers who want their pound of meat to be completely disappointed .. I didn't think I could be further disappointed, but then I saw that Guillermo del Toro produced this dreck
