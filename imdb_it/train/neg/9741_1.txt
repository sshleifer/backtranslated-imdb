(spoiler) The only truly memorable part of this piece of British cuisine, otherwise quite boring and tepid, is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dyeing jobs ever. That and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the bad old guy who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a film sadly boring and gray fun. I particularly like when Crow kills Mike with his "touch of death", and when he brings him back to the theater, Mike shouts "Guys, I'm dead, I've seen eternal truth and beauty! disappointment, having to return from the beyond to see the rest of The Projected Man. The film could make a fortune sold as a sleep aide. Some of the film's word games were evil: police inspector - "electrocution!" Crow - "Shocking, isn't it?" police inspector- "That's lowe, okay" Tom Servo- "Very low, right at the bottom of the floor!" police inspector - "Can I get on?" Tom Servo- "He's dead, but get out" MST3K is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer.
