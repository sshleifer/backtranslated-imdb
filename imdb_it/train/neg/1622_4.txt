The only reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale's brilliant QUATERMASS series was broadcast. The trailers strongly emphasize that the main character had a mutilated arm that made me hope that he would be like Victor Caroon from the QUATERMASS expert who wandered the streets of London. <br /> <br /> I have not had so much luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather bleak thriller with the expedient of having a hero with a physical disability who tries to get to the bottom of the corrupt horse race investigations. I suppose if you are a fan of Dick Francis you could enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s, when THE SWEENEY was just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still in production, there is something missing in THE RACING GAME. A trailer featured a car to bring another on a car, if it was a trailer for THE SWEENEY you would have seen Jack Regan take a car and beat a confession from the dross that had made a turn while THE PROFESSIONALS He would have ended up with a car and wiped out the terrorists inside. I think it sums up what's wrong with this series
