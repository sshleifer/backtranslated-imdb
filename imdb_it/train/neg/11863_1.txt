I thought this film was a disappointment, I expected it to be much better than before. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie and I didn't sit in a cinema for that. Where to start this film, the acting in this film was average, the humor was terrible and only the overall plot of this film was not special. I thought this movie should be great, but it was nothing but a poor waste of time. I think the acting in this movie was terrible. None of the actors in this film had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think if we had a different actor, playing Kirk by Jay Baruchel would have been better, but all the time I saw this movie it looked up and I didn't have the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress, but there was no connection between her and Jay. All the actors in this film have no names and have had a small impact in this film. The humor in this film was not at all funny, there were some movies in this film that were fine, but nothing worth telling your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick to the Burger King commercials. I think this film could have been better if the writers had gone to a different director. The plot of this movie is just like any other hot girl OK boyfriend romance? Boring I think it would have been better if it had had more originality, but nothing disappointed. I honestly would not recommend anyone to go and see this movie. I think you would have more entertainment at the dentist than in this movie. So save yourself the agony and just don't see it.
