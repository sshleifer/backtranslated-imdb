I like watching western movies but this movie takes the biscuit. The script and dialogue are ridiculous. The acting was horrible, where did they get them from? The music was OK, I have to say. Fortunately, I didn't buy or rent the movie, but it has now been deleted. <br /> <br /> At first I was prepared when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. I must admit I liked the fight between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong shot his finger and told him to train for 40 years to reach his league. But this is where everything went pear-shaped from then on. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would improve, never done.
