There are some very talented black directors like Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel and many others who bring credit to the film industry. Then there are the Wayans brothers who once (15 years ago) had an extremely entertaining TV show "In Living Color" that launched Jim Carrey's career among others. Now we have the stupidity that replaces humor and gross gags (humor in toilets) as a standard operating procedure. People are not as stupid as those portrayed in "Little Man" who could not be. Is a child with a complete set of teeth and a tattoo accepted as if he were only a few months old? The child arrives with a shadow of the five that he shaves. The child is said to have sex with his adoptive mother behind their husbands, Darryl's, again. Oh yes, it's just fun. As a criminal master "Little Man" is the most stupid on the planet earth. He hides a stolen stone that is just huge in a woman's bag and then has to chase it. Co-star Chazz Palminteri, because Chazz offers the best line: "I'm surrounded by morons". Based, without credit, on a cardboard by Chuck Jones, Baby Buggy Bunny. This is too stupid to be even remotely funny. A clue to how ugly this movie is Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night, before the BAT awards and he didn't, mentioning even this terrible movie. When Hollywood stops the green lighting garbage from the Wayans brothers. When they will overcome their white man's guilt in all probability.
