I read the reviews before watching this movie and didn't believe it. I love shit movies and I expected this to be average. It wasn't. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 appear as big. The film contains a bad acting, a poor sound, a baffling storyline, a bad composition - and it bored me so much I turned it off. even nakedness was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I don't think they did it. You can understand if you will like this movie or not in the first 5 minutes. if you want a good gum film, look at the toxic avenger 4 or even the blood of the field. Avoid this garbage: I watched it on TV and felt torn, so don't spend anything. The best part is probably the end.
