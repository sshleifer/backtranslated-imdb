This film starts slowly, then thins out. After watching for about an hour and having seen absolutely nothing, I left. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. ZIP. Nada. There is no story The characters are vague representations of the most boring people that none of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in court if they try to sell it as a "moving" image. There is no movement. I could have said the same "story" with a couple of photo captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt any screenwriting doctor in the world could save him. My biggest regret is not having wasted 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in the Time of Money", but I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to leave, but I waited a little too long. Instead, I saw about 20 people coming out in front of me.
