How could I best express my feelings for this film: horrible? headache? lack of coherent writing? simple stupidity? Try all of the above for this parody. And that's just for the management. <br /> <br /> History? Well, I guess there's a story. Two stupid blondes look for a job after crashing a plane on a golf course. They are mistaken for a "renounced murderer in the world" (sarcasm) and are "hired" by two "mafiosi". One thinks "taking him out" means an appointment, and the other becomes the minor actor that she dreams of. And, of course, the turtle reserve for the fart turtle, which they build with casino winnings. <br /> <br /> It seems like this can be fun? Guess again. They try to make it fun, but it's not. The shooting sequences are not well done. I've seen the best shots in Hong Kong movies. The images are average for a 1980s movie. But the problem is that it's a 2007 film. <br /> <br /> It's not worth my time to see it again. He still hasn't beaten Danny Glover's "Out" movie of the early 80s as the worst movie of all time, but then again that movie is in a class of its own. "F"
