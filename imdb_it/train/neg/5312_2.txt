The typically terrible trash of director Fred Olen Ray about a female cyborg hunter (Teagan) commissioned by director Jan-Michael Vincent to find and execute the escaped foreign convict, Ross Hagen, who set the course for the land. Soon Forest Ranger John Phillip Law will have to protect a group of hatefully educated college boys led by the grating Richard Wiley who invested Hagen with his camper on a camping trip gone wrong. Soon the cyborg will shoot with its burning arm an innocent alcoholic doctor (Robert Quarry of the fame of Count Yorga-Vampire) demonstrating that no one will remain in the way to recover the skin of the condemned, whose collar is a tracking device that weakens his body. Law finds an ally in Leo Gordon, an old Vietnam War veteran with too many weapons hidden in his cabin. <br /> <br /> Perhaps intentionally made horrible, it presents what rancid cinema fans want. effects, acting and premise. At least, the film has PJ Soles for a bit of eye candy ... even in 1989, it was pretty smoky. That laser gun is definitely fun. It can incinerate some houses again when the Cyborg shoots Law and barely leaves a mark on the fired position.
