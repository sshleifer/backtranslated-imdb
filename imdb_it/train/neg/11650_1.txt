After leaving the first one, you think the wayan brothers could invent new jokes. Even if I imagine not. If the first one wasn't bad enough, this is so bad that it hurts to see. With all the actors in this film, you think they could come up with something a little smarter. Though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raucous, non-amusing jokes from the first one and somehow put it in this movie thinking that people would laugh again. Although the thing is that I didn't laugh the first time. They tried to turn these films into parodies even if they failed at every level. Most of the time they are just randomly inserted jokes, which are so disgusting and vulgar that it's hard to watch and enjoy it. Then, when they try to make scenes that are movie parodies, they end up doing a 20-minute recreation of the scene with perhaps a joke within the whole scene. Even for people who say it's not for the younger and more real audience, well, I adapt to the age group which should be fun. While people say that different people have different ideas about what's fun or not, if you find it funny, then you're probably not one of the most mature or intelligent people around. It doesn't take much skill to write that kind of script, but if you want a smarter and more fun movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It is a parody of movies that is actually good and well made and didn't have to use disgusting and vulgar jokes to make it fun.
