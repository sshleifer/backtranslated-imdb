I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so it wasn't my problem. My problem is that I felt like watching my neighbor's home movie. IMO all about it looked like a guy who wrote a short story, grabbed a camera and started shooting. I understand how difficult this should be to do effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I expect to watch some kind of professionally made film. <br /> <br /> John Schneider has a huge track record, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. The other people in it were not. I understand how it must be fun and less expensive to use friends and relatives like the cast, but it is not convincing acting. It looked like the way it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the script, the plot and the acting are there to begin with, that kind of style isn't necessary, and it's a distraction. <br /> <br /> Even on a technical level, it had digital artifacts everywhere. In the first scene of all those beautiful cars, when they performed a slow scan of them, they seemed to jump back and forth just a little. The problem is not in my display equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal) but somewhere in production, I have never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally produced film before, so there was sound. They don't have made no dubbing, which can be ok unless you look like the track of this movie, which resembled the camera's built-in microphone.
