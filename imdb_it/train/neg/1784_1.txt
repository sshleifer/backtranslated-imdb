OK, I recorded it via TV and got lost in the beginning. The film was about 10 seconds in the titles (I assume) so if something had happened before I missed it. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Mark Hammill is in this, I have not seen it. I recognized Clive Barker, John Landis and of course Stephen King doing a really horrible acting as a cemetery assistant. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is adorable apart from the scenes in which she has the face of a cat or is completely alien -up. <br /> <br /> Even with the opening titles it was never very well explained exactly what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence I assume that they are feline bipeds that live by extracting life force from humans. I assume they live long and these two details are probably the last of their kind. <br /> <br /> Add to this a very large amount of incest (Yes, I thought it was also a bit suspicious), shapeshifters, killer cats and invisibility and you have Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> It's a bad story that has no real explanations behind the 2 main characters and too many cameos to try to distract from the simple fact that it's not quite explained to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
