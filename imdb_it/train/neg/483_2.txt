I didn't think the French could make a bad film, but I was, of course, very wrong. As mentioned earlier, this film essentially uses its title character as a starting point; his portrait of his life and his person has little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The script is horrible - pretentious, pungent and silly - and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that too often earns a living by distorting, rather than telling, the story. Along with some pretty decent sets, Valentina Cervi's physical charm is the main resource of this film, and it is obvious from the beginning that even filmmakers were aware of it; they don't waste time inventing various "erotic" sequences that have much more to do with titillation than with the development of the plot or character. Unfortunately, the attractiveness of seeing a beautiful girl in a state of fake sexual excitement cannot and does not support this film. The acting is insignificant and the score is too general despite an interesting deal or two. Cinematography is OK, and there are some beautiful colors, but there are also some ridiculous sequences using effects with distorted lenses more appropriate for a 1960s movie than a costume film. In any case, the script leaves the camera too often in Artemisia's body, and too rarely in his paintings. <br /> <br /> All in all, an almost complete failure. He's not smart or tasteful enough to be a serious movie, and he's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography. So the French can fail after all!
