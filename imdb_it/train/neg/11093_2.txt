If this film was about a fictional character, the film could stand alone and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the film is based on "facts" that are very unfairly blended with Ruben Carter. Many of the minor facts were ignored (Carter was NOT the number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no evidence that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the most important facts, such as apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of "racist" judges, is unforgivable for those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Because Hollywood feels the need to make a hero someone who, at best, was in trouble and in trouble, far more than any normal person should be (he was arrested several times for beating women) is weird for me . Ruben Carter was never, observing his actions in the 1960s and even now, when he refuses to talk to his son, a person that people can watch. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but because they chose this story because their vehicle is beyond me. Does Hollywood have so much need of a black hero who needs to bend the truth in all his bio-photos to make them credible? (Here's a hint. How about Denzel who plays a movie about himself? Now this is inspirational) Based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I'd suggest moving on to this.
