I could not wait to see Kathryn Bigelow's film with great anticipation after the endless clamor and 6 Oscars that was awarded. Unfortunately, it's not a good movie. The representation of the situation certainly seemed accurate and credible from all points of view, but beyond that the story was simply incomplete and the direction of the film seemed uncertain and casual. The actors did a good job, but for me I didn't really understand what the film was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and compelling as Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as Band of Brothers, not so full of action ... well, anything. I certainly can't understand why he was nominated for so much, nor why people are "exaggerating" these epic proportions. Mind you, given the caliber of the movies over the past two years, I suppose there isn't much to choose from.
