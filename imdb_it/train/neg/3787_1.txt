I have to be that guy in America who didn't like this movie. I guess this wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating, this was * barely funny, not to mention one of the biggest successes in film history. <br /> <br /> It is a boy who comes from nowhere and continues to become a drug lord. A simple enough way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the whole movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias / drug trafficking / criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a fantastic movie, don't forget the good storytelling.
