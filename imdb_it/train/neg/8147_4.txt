This film was a confusing piece of trash. You never knew what was happening. The characters were poorly written and for the most part they were totally unpleasant except for Gus (masterfully played by George Eads). I hate this movie but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) he should have won an academic award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in a shameful and scruffy film. You have lived a new minimum. Someone has to make sure that this director never works in movies again. This was also supposed to be a horror movie because it was much more fun than scary. For the shame of life, for shame.
