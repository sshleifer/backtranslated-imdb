This film was written and directed so badly that I fell asleep for 30 minutes in the film. The jokes in the film are trivial and even if the plot is interesting from a certain point of view, it is too far-fetched and in some places - ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you neglect writing in the film and you will be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will catch your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which I might add are bad) and I would like you I was a warrior. The casting in this film wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to increase the tension, but it didn't fit at all. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is excellent, 1 is horrible) the acting in this film is a 4. Brenda Song has talent in comedy, but with this type of film, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When he made some of his "fighting" poses, I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the direction, for example, the part where its enemy turns out to be the person the evil enemy possesses, how his voice becomes dark and evil, I think it was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's teachers (Brenda Song) were all his monastic teachers at school, which was rather ridiculous. So to sum it all up, a disappointing movie, but it's okay if you have 10 or less.
