This is a terrible film, a terrible script, bad direction and a senseless ending. Also, bad performances, except from Clancy Brown who is abused here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you do it to download enough bad movie karma to really see a better one. <br /> <br /> The film features a father and a son who seem unable to possibly have been linked The male protagonist's part is not well written and seems inconstant in this role. You can see the plot a mile away. The actions of the female protagonist and that of her brother, the policeman, also make no sense. Thus, a great action on his part at the end of the film makes no sense from the point of view of the script.
