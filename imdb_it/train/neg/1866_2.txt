A film of economic exploitation on a mother who is looking for her daughter kidnapped by people who make porn movies. The track leads the mother across Europe as she searches for her son and we in the audience struggle to sleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of the countless soft-core films that are made for people who want the excitement of porn without the stigma or danger that appears on the credit card account. Personally I prefer to have the stigma, because those films tend to be more interesting and honest about what we are seeing. This should be a sexy thriller but it's not. Most people talk about things followed by a lot of walking from one place to another and lead to lead. Through the film, several people get naked and everything has more than a touch of S & M in the proceedings. Violence and fetish material are such to cause laughter rather than horror or even excitement, it's all so incredibly false. Worse, there isn't even enough nudity to make it interesting. (Basically par for the course for many of these films) <br /> <br /> you will forgive my lack of detail but it is simply a boring boring film with which I remained until the end hoping something remotely itchy happened, but there was nothing. The most interesting thing was the hairiness of the blond hair with the huge bite and the nose the size of a Buick. I watched her with morbid fascination asking me what she looked like when I was young and wondering if she had done plastic surgery, not the kind of things you should think of in a compelling thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
