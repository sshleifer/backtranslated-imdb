Now, I haven't read the original story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to follow this path here. <br /> <br /> But I learned some time ago that Stephen King's films simply - they're not horror movies, with maybe a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started pretty well, and for once I'm not going to complain about acting, even though Fred Gwynne was wonderful as usual .. I too will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were needed to advance the story here. .. <br /> <br /> But there was a consistent point that I couldn't help but bother. And this came close enough to the end of the film, and at least 2 characters participated in the stupid stupidity activity. The moments I refer to are like this: there is a tiny zombie that runs around the house. You suspect it's under the bed. (<br /> <br /> (a) Get as close to the bed as possible before blindly raising the duvet cover, exposing your entire body to virtually any damage an undead young cannon could inflict on you, or <br /> <br /> (b) move away from the bed a little so that you can peek under the fully open end from a slightly increased security position, or at least see the mini-terror coming towards you, giving you a little reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). Today I want to offer myself for the massacre. Bleh <br /> <br /> Fun enough movie though ... Just not very scary .
