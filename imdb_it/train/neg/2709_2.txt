The only way to get something out of this film is to approach it like a comedy. Seen in that light, it does. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. This film has absolutely no depth and offers little more than a superficial and superficial examination of "problems" without intuitions. <br /> <br /> Making a film about stereotypes and thus making every single character in the movie a stereotype is an extremely poor strategy, especially when those same characters break their mundane patterns in predictable and stereotyped ways. <br /> <br /> Busta Rhymes and Ice Cube make the film almost watchable and Michael Rappaport turns into a good performance, but the script is so terrible and the social commentary is so trivial, it's hard to find something that redeems.
