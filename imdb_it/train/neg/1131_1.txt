Too bad that even a talented director, Desplechin, failed to stage a decent performance by a gloomy-looking actress, Phoenix, Esther Kahn doesn't have the substance to convey a very concise and clear storyline. In an attempt to satisfy the concentric circle of an actor's difficult situation, the performance and presentation are too elaborate and poorly performed to draw compassion from the viewer. In an excessively long execution time, the redundancy of Esther's struggle is too melodramatic to be effective and reduces the plot in a fragile frame of a disastrous display. The content is inconsistent and free as Phoenix struggles to execute Desplechin's instructions, just as Esther is trying to do the same. Never feeling a convincing victory over Esther's pain, we never feel a victory in Phoenix's talent.
