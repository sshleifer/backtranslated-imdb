I saw him at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! Every clich√©, violent, rich boyish fantasy was on display, you only knew how it would end, especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the Q&A with the director / writer and writer / producer they tried to run into intellectuals, but it could be said that they are the types that descend on violence. I bet everything they go to brothels and drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time. I had to stop my boy from getting out.
