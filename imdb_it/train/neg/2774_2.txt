This is just a bad movie. With what seemed to be a nice budget, it could have been a lot better. They were almost. With the heroine beautiful almost like Salma Hayek, the hero who fights almost like Jackie Chan, battles and duels almost like in Crouching Tiger ..., almost like music, for example, Conan ... etc. Almost. But in the end it's just boring and it's hard to find something interesting in it. Perhaps apart from John Rhys-Davies who fights like those Hero warriors or the aforementioned squatting tiger ... I'm really ashamed of poor old John. After all he is a pretty good actor and deserves much more. Just like you - so if you still have the chance to look at something else.
