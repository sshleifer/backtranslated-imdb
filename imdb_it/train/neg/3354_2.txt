It is my opinion that when you decide to do a great film again, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a new point of view. Now 1963 that Robert Wise tells of Shirley Jackson's remarkable novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is worth the admission price even today. Now it advances fast until 1999 and the remake. I was left to shake my head and ask, why? The acting is of wood, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with the number of special effects that computers can generate. I had heard that this update was negative; but I couldn't believe it was so bad considering the starting material. I was wrong. After seeing this and telling my wife how horrible it was, he said; "Well they took your money!" He's right, don't let them take yours. If there are no profits in making crappy shelters, maybe they will stop creating them or they will reach a higher standard that does not offend their audience
