this film was not absolutely atrocious, but it was pretty ugly. the acting was really good! Jeffrey's combs did a great job as the mad scientist, which is kind of his specialty if you don't know these things: D. Bill forsythe .. well, I'm not exactly sure why it was in this movie. it's too good for this kind of thing, and his role wasn't exactly exacting. I rented it on the strength of those two contacts, and I wasn't really disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a film about a half man / half shark. They are not Shakespeare's people. Apart from the plot, which is full of holes, and poor dialogue, I would like to note that cinematography has left many things to be desired. there were shots where they tried to look "cool", but in the end they darkened the scene or simply came out of the cheezy. they also choked him many times when they had a decent dialogue and interrupted him prematurely before the person could even deliver the line. it was pretty bad but if you're a jeffrey fan, this is worth a try. gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. not even forsithhe is bad, and is the female protagonist. heck if I can remember his name though. bottom line, otherwise I would not waste your time.
