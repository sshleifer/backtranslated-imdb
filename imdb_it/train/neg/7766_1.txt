<br /> <br /> As with the other episodes of this bespoke TV series that extends the many adventures of the legend of the sea, the super-human infallibility of Horatio Hornblower spoils every possibility of suspense. <br /> <br /> When little Wesley Crusher ruined many seasons of THE NEXT GENERATION, Horatio Hornblower saves every situation invincibly. Every single intelligent solution inevitably comes from the lips of Horatio Hornblower. Immeasurably superior, Hornblower's main problem in this film series seems to tolerate the many characters dominated by errors above and below him in the chain of command. A perfect being makes history boring. So superior is our hero, that even those who try to help him are unable to do something properly unless Hornblower is there to direct and control their every move. <br /> <br /> What is the point in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every time? What is the point of looking at such a story?
