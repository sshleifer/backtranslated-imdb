I must say that I am really surprised by the high ratings of this film. I found it absolutely idiotic. Does the mother receive "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing he touched twice made his vision go on ... It seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible, I thought. It was very irritating. The girl who played Lori did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for the one they worked with. <br /> <br /> I usually love LMN and am very open to the movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous storyline and top notch and it wasn't just for me.
