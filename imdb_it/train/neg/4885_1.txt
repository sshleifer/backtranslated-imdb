I should have listened. I was warned, and again, I paid for it, after reading all the reviews, after learning that the original is "so bad is good", and that part 2 does not fit into that category, again, even then, I I couldn't resist. Exactly what happened here? The first part was hilarious, it had so much politically incorrect, and other Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this, there really couldn't be a worse sequel on God's green earth, not case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This it's really the worst sequel in history and this is really something that says considering the innovative, low-level quality of the original barrel. Part 2 of Criminally Insane was just a completely different brand of bad. Shot on video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original and, above all, Ethel has lost a part of its circumference. I mean, honestly, is it some kind of sick joke?!? Thank you very much, Nick Milliard. 1/1
