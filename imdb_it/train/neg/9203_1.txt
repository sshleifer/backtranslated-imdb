Many people like to focus on this TV movie when they argue with Hanks-philes' huge legions out there that Tom really made lousy movies (I think "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons-style game" that eventually leads our young Gump towards a hallucinatory madness. The story is fascinating in the early 1980s, focusing on the imminent threat to our youth represented by those evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> I prefer, however, to see "Mazes and Monsters" as the turning point in "Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace?" history. we all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and as the unfortunate Clifford in "My Bodyguard", where he gave us an indirect thrill by beating the shit of Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" On a regular basis) that great things were in store for him. <br /> <br /> And then Rona Jaffe arrived. The line between bad acting and bad writing is as thin as a razor, so I leave it to you to decide what is the fault of Makepeace's performance in this. All I know is that the last major I saw was "Vamp", and that was 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but at that time the torch of Brat Pack had been passed to others with more rights and loose curriculum hair. <br /> <br /> I cannot in good conscience recommend this film. Just watch it to see Chris Makepeace younger and idealistic, before Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul.
