Unfortunately it's true. "Legiunea sträinä" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of the irreversible failure of Daneliuc. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the author has lost the ability to merge his content factors and artistic intentions into a coherent form. Maniacally worried about the mechanical trick of randomly choosing news stories and joining them together without any legitimacy, he collects only a messy pile of events, unable to follow the slightest plot. The level of the script is similar to an amateur drama "Cântarea României" on the glorious achievements of socialist realism - alone, upside down: while the communist line dictated a concern limited only to positivism and sugary festivism, now Daneliuc is perniciously obsessed only by negativism and disgusting scatology. The content of the ideas is zero, and the "message", infantile and didactic, at the level of the nursery school. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he has also forgotten the most basic professional principles. He is no longer able to organize a dramatic situation, order it in a correct cinematographic scene, frame it correctly and modify it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His narrative level in cinematic images is similar to the phrasing of something like: "Holy man of tin is not bad at first, and all the people are a donkey!" What an enormous distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works like "Cursa", "Proba de microfon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
