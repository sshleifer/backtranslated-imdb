Sarah Silverman is really the "flavor of the month" comic right now. Is it really worth the whole advertising campaign? Yes and no. It's fun sometimes, sometimes hilariously (its standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always fun). Other times, you feel cheated by the media for overwriting another actor. She is one of those really nice comedies that men flock to in particular, saying that they dig her intelligence and intelligence. But if you put them on the corner, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they look at her. It reminds me of why many men poured on Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, although none of them is really "hot" now in terms of popularity. Sarah does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so it should be hot when she is 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> As for this show, it's a lot like his comedy. When it works, it's fun. When he doesn't do it, he is full of boredom and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It's always fun and contains good satire. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in one episode, and it's fun to see him in a T-shirt with a tongue. But in reality they never go anywhere and eventually wear out. Sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and some other guys) seem to be attacked and never do anything for the show as a whole, and supportive players (including Sarah's real sister, Laura, who doesn't look like something like her) I'm OK. When the jokes hit, they are brilliant. When they don't, they are horrible, and I mean really terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced the current humor and intelligence in today's comedy. So should you watch this show? If you have a crush on Sarah, try it. You can watch it and pretend it's yours. As for his show, it goes from good to absolute zero.
