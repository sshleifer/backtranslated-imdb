I read the other comment on this film and usually try not to be severe in my criticism because I try to be a good person. However, this film is one of the worst films I have ever seen (and this was the culmination of a terrible service in the USA Network and in the Cinemax evenings.) Anyone who has thought of this film should NEVER be allowed to create another one. This film disgusted me in a way that no other film has ever seen. I REALLY think these people are crazy. Save your time and don't watch this fllm. Please, I wish I had it. The acting is horrible, the plot (that plot) is STUPID and degrading and crazy. I really don't think this should have been turned into a movie. But this is my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.
