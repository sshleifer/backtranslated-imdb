Shame on the films of Yash Raj and Aditya Chopra that seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and provide constant amounts of tripe in this piece of cinematic shit that doesn't even apply to You Tube standards. I was gritting my teeth for the whole film from beginning to end with the schizophrenic direction, the plot that never materialized and in the last scene I was ashamed that my country and its filmmakers could create "spread the road" with such stupidity. Shame on the actors for taking this job and even commenting on it as a piece of work they may have. Saif Ali Khan - completely disappointed in the choice of the film. Kareen shows enough skin for puberty and Akshay looks like the dark brain. Anil another retarded with a pubescent charm for English. His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered over the last 15 minutes, it was enough to burst a blood vessel. DON'T REMOVE your brain cells, energy or your money to go and see this- Go SEE / Rent AMU -with Konkana Sensharma instead- a beautiful piece of independent film that came out of India.Intelligent, moving and a wonderful fairy tale that will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me the hope that not everything is lost in Indian cinema.
