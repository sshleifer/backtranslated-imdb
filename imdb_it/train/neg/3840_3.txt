I had heard about this movie some time ago by a friend and he recently did it on DVD. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement, as we both felt that this was a terrifying, really scary movie. How disappointed was I by ?? VERY!!!! Apart from that scene (we all know which bit) it happened NOTHING !!! I expected to see the woman in black a couple of times and make her some more lively scene, like appearing at the window or crossing the hall or something. <br /> <br /> Almost all the reviews here say that this is a scary, thrilling and atmospheric film. I haven't seen it, I'm afraid. Perhaps there is a difference in what people find scary in the United States here in Britain. <br /> <br /> A big disappointment after all the advertised reviews :(
