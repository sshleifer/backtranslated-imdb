The acting was horrible, as was the script. He was put together badly and almost made you want to laugh at the terribly recited murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone continued to die, but somehow the ending made it seem like everything was perfectly OK! They have not given enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The film needed more time to develop a better plot. The only reason I gave this 3/10 is that I feel bad for young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made this an OK movie, but the script and acting failed miserably.
