Honestly, before seeing this film, I had heard many people say that this film was a disgrace. I didn't believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took part in this movie, and I watched it for myself. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondered all the time during the film - why the hell did I watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course I didn't expect much from Justin since he doesn't really belong to the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I couldn't stop wondering why the hell they agreed to take part in Edison. To be honest, their roles are pretty stupid. <br /> <br /> Well, you might think that if the players suck, then I should pay more attention to the story. In fact, the story is the heart of a movie, but guys ... believe me ... this is not a movie you want to give credit for its history. Imagine this, a crafty journalist (Justin Timberlake) wrote a story against the system and at the same time learned how to become a "real" journalist from his boss (Morgan Freeman). All this was supported by an agent who still has a heart for justice (LL Cool J) and a brilliant investigator (Kevin Spacey). In the end, they beat the system with a happy ending story. <br /> <br /> Jeez, I could not continue with this. Just remembering the movie is already making me sick. My advice guys, don't watch it! Please save your money and time for another movie.
