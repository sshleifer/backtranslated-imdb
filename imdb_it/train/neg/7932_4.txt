Oh dear! What a disappointment. I've been watching old westerns on British TV for decades, and I didn't know about it until yesterday - most of Scott's other Westerns come around every few years and it's usually worth watching them again. <br /> <br /> The rich colors and the external settings were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. Several times I wanted to turn it off, and in the end I did, halfway, something I hardly do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusually greasy in charming girls, his two helpers were annoying and so was the Mexican banned boy. And I have the feeling that the army uniforms were 20 years or less too modern, not that this annoyed the producers of many other Westerners. <br /> <br /> Maybe it got better in the second half, but I couldn't be bothered to wait and see
