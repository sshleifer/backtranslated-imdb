This is an exclusive sequel to "A Christmas Story", originally titled "A Summer Story". Ralphie recounts his family's adventures during the summer, when they moved to a small country town in the middle of nowhere. The hilarity, unfortunately, does not follow. <br /> <br /> The original worked for its irreverent nature and its honesty: everyone could recognize it. This is simply stupid and not very funny. Charles Grodin's latest film - no wonder! It is one of his poorest roles. I felt sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen has little to do, everything is terrific, and you have to ask yourself why they took the trouble. <br /> <br /> And I mean, give a competition with spins ?! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
