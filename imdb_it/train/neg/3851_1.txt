I never thought I'd see a movie worse than "Lisa Picard is famous", but this came close enough. As often repeated in all the comments, it was predictable; five minutes after the movie, you know it will be an obstacle to the alter result. This film painfully / removes everything from "Something about Mary" to "Revenge of the Pink Panther". Screenwriter Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs new material. <br /> <br /> The only turning point is the deranged boy / policeman pursued by internal affairs, but even this opportunity is wasted. Lots of settings in the Seattle Space Needle needed to camouflage the obvious Canadian gunshot scene. Some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to hide the fact that the car is dragged through the city on a trailer. Damn, at least turn the wheel or put on the brakes once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and short haircut is a crime. $ 3M to Jason Lee, for what? Guess who beats on the skateboard! <br /> <br /> So here's who should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream'; People who can't get enough of Julia Stiles. 1/10
