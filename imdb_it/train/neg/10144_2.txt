As a film by Steven Segal, this is the bottom of the cane. His best was just fodder for bored teenagers. This points the scale, then falls. The characters are all made of cardboard. The story is doubly lame. I can't ruin it by telling you the ending. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end up if you've seen one. Here it is. He is an agent of the super-master government who knows too much to free himself, so they decide, instead of killing him, to take drugs on his brain until he remembers the squat. Flees, of course, is arrested and is located by his old general who needs his one man in a million experiences to retrieve an invisible plane that was delivered to a terrorist gang in Afghanastan by a surprising Air Force pilot surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, with the exception of the character of Segal and his dark girl, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in one fell swoop, or falls into a dive. Everything. Made with a twisted flying Air Force and Navy film. And a lot of boom-boom. Take Popeye cartoons instead.
