Well, what can I say, there are B-level movies and there are B-level movies and this is definitely in the second one. However, since it is obvious that even the film's creators know that it is not a credible film (take a look at the credits) it can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a convicted psychopathic killer is killed. He accidentally mixed his genetic material with an experimental acid that is combined and then lost in the snow. The killer now takes the form of a snowman - if you can believe it. The snowman, Jack Frost, follows the sheriff of the town that put him behind bars. Thus, Jack Frost ends up killing half of the city. <br /> <br /> This film lacks any real fear and the effects alone remind me of the B-Grade films of the 1950s. This alone is worth watching for a laugh. A movie to pass the time.
