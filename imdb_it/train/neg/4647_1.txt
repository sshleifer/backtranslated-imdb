Half of the reviews were good, so I took the chance for $ 10. Of course Priscilla Barnes had sexually talked about it but it wasn't much. The whole plot after she could be the other mother actress and the documentarian who falls in love with the young woman is stretching her. It's not funny, it's not so vulgar, it's just a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult industry and this is not based on anything that has ever happened in the industry. He could have been shocked with what is popular today in adult movies that mock today's gonzo videos and that big orgy that took 5 minutes to resume that joke a bigger orgy was made bigger and better decades ago in the early years 70.
