This is the most useless and boring piece of shit I've ever wasted an hour of my life. All I can say is thank God it was only an hour. Over half of this "film" is the footage of the original "Criminally Insane". At the very least, I was able to see the highlights of that rare classic of exploitation, since for some reasons that challenge reality, my video store only has "Criminally Insane II" (as in the case of "Crazy Fat Ethel II "). But the rest of this film is one of the worst acting films and short films you will see at home. Why does my video store have this and not the original? Why do things like that end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and do not immediately burn the copy once they have seen its pure horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? <br /> <br /> Unless you like to see annoying fruits eating an entire bar in an atrociously slow scene, or that the fruit hangs on the railing of the ladder in an even slower scene, or a character who comes stabbed from the side (don't ask) several times in the back, or monologues that kill brain cells about giving their wife poisoned tea and then complain that the whole talk has cooled their tea, or mentally- soup eaten delayed soup or just want to see the Crazy Fat Ethel dance with a bloody knife in a garden: don't watch this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Don't rent this movie. If possible, don't go past a shelf in a video store that contains a copy of this video. You can still be saved, but now it's too late for me. . .
