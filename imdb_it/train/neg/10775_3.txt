This movie is horrible! It is rival "Ishtar" in the number of ugly embarrassing moments. I would have rated less than a 3, except for a couple of funny lines; but, overall, this movie was crap! Looks like they had a weekend in some bankrupt village somewhere. Joe Roth should join Elaine May as director forever!
