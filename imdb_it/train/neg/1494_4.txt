Yes, definitely better than my vision of the Tunnel of death. Actually some of the deaths were quite original and the blood was good. It was a bit like Wrong Turn and Hills Have Eyes. <br /> <br /> BUT: 1.) When the "kids" (high school or university?) are discussing horror movies in the kitchen, all that Shae says is almost an exact quote from Scream (1996). The thing about big-breasted girls etc. <br /> <br /> 2.) Wasn't Steve a Scream bootleg of Scream? 3.) Besides the fact that it took place in October, what the hell did the film have to do with Samhain? Rather useless if you ask me. I find it funny when I see those horror movies of the 1980s that explain loose ends by pointing fingers at druids or a pentagram. <br /> <br /> 4.) Wow did they refer to Sam Raimi !!! 5.) Why were Gary and his sister in the movie? They are characters who have nothing to do with anything. And hes so psychic that he couldn't even see his OWN death? 6.) When Gary was killed in the bathroom (at which point the deaths simply became Troma-licious) how could he hear the screams when he was downstairs but didn't hear them when he was outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister commented on Haggis - this is primarily a Scottish dish, not an Irish one. <br /> <br /> 8.) So the lesson is whether you ARE like Shae and not having fun or making a smile through the whole movie, will you be the one to live? 9.) The mutants were very beautiful, but they looked like walking dishes of Chili with meat. <br /> <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister home, did they forget that Steve HAD was tied up there and wonders where he went? 11.) Wasn't there more than one killer? He beat him, but he never saw more. <br /> <br /> 12.) What was with those other people's flashbacks? Half of them didn't know if they were alive or dead, so what was there? 13.) Why didn't they kill Gary and his sister first? 14.) Why has no one ever called the police? And apparently everyone knew that those people lived in the woods, why did they never organize a kind of raid? 15.) As far as I know, they were not zombies or vampires, so how could he "transform" into one at the end? I'm with everyone else on the giant "eh?" at the end. <br /> <br /> Much better than the tunnel of death, but still rather sloppy. I still don't understand why they even put it in Ireland, considering that Samhain had almost nothing to do with the plot.
