Anyone who has said it's better than the hostel is talking about complete shit, believe me, I'm not a fan of the hostel, but this is simply ridiculous. This is just another shot on the camera, directly on DVD, waste of ideas about your time, I can't believe how many of these films there are and I still have to see a decent one. In the 80s video-productions, gore and horror films were made without a budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and, above all, the heart and soul of the director who had something to say. Now they just seem to be pumped up trying to trick people who surf Blockbuster into renting a copy, until people stop doing it, so I guess these films will continue to appear. This film is so low in ideas that it's simply amazing how it's ever been done, the acting is also terrible, the position completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying that it begs beliefs. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to do, unless you are looking for a list of the worst movies of all time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don't pull back, you can see that she's not even covering the trigger with her finger holding the grip. An absolute joke.
