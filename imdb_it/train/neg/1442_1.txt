This is the worst crap imaginable. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very funny and dramatic. The creators of this worthless movie don't follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has their own ideas. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and watered down clich√©s, you should stick to the original. Had they done so, this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if it had been shot in a studio with cardboard huts. BUt there is no imagination at all just fatigue. This should only be bought or seen by collectors of Victorian novels turned into films. <br /> <br /> Just a suggestion, and not a spoiler, I think, to make people who read the novel understand what happened and what you can expect if you decide to watch it on TV or, God forbid, waste money on buy it. Gagool has an old evil witch in the book and some of Gollum's precursors have been turned into a pretty girl!
