I've seen many good Korean films including thrillers and movies with darker shades, but this sucks. The director seems to be a sadist, which happened to someone to produce garbage. The film lacks any kind of entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can't believe anyone actually made a film like that. Even if acting is OK, the plot and the feeling it leaves is horrible. I'm sure, I won't see any of this director's films. No sense of film creation and total disappointment in having thriller moments. All this shows scenes with psychopaths who waste the reels with badly turned scenes and show more blood and violence thinking that makes it thrilling. Very disappointing film and I highly recommend skipping all the movies of this type.
