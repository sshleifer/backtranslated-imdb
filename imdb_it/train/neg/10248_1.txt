the end of the world looks like a good movie on a box set, but know it's a bad fan. A big fan of actor mega star Christopher Lee made me fooled. like tentacles (77) a good cast does not mean it will be a good movie. The beginning looks promising, then turns into tedium, many parts of the film are too dark to see what's going on. The rest of the cast is shown briefly as: Lew ayres, Dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as a security guard. I would expect better from Charles's band who made fun movies like the re-animator and the dolls. I heard that Christopher Lee was tricked into making this movie. he told his co stars that it would be Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger. Says Jagger is there, but the other two never did it (lucky) if you make a film about the end of the world, use a bigger budget and better plot. After Jagger continued to make two good movies later, alligator (80 ) and the game of death (79) to quote Lyon (Lolita) is also in the film minus his lollipop. 10.
