This film is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that have been put together by the most shameless fools to work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this film that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone who has ever participated in this production has ever gotten another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote this junk did it to attack a man who was claimed by history and the fear that someone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist jobs, Ronald Reagan took over from McCarthy and failed to stop him, then the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never watch this movie if you are looking for the truth about Senator McCarthy. Read the book by Ann Coulter, "Betrayal" for a better view of the truth about Senator McCarthy. <br /> <br /> It will also help you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
