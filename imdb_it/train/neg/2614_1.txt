A sequel to (actually a remake of the Disney 1996 live remake of 101 Dalmations. Cruella deVil (Glenn Close) is released from prison after being "cured" by his obsession with fur by a psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (ugh !) But the "cure" is interrupted when Crudelia feels the balance of Big Ben, and once again she launches into a mad search to make herself the perfect coat with the Dalmatian skins. <br /> <br /> This movie it hurts many levels, starting with the fact that it's a movie "Thanksgiving family schlock" designed to suck every last bit of money available from the Disney marketing machine. Glenn Close over-over-over-over-acts as Cruella. which she had to put up with in this movie - the lame script, the endless trick, cooking in a pie at the end - I hope they gave her an extremely big salary. <br /> <br /> (By the way, where in the world do you have planning to find a pellic factory ce, a bakery with a Rube Goldberg assembly line and a candlelit restaurant all located in the same building - how do you do in the climax of this movie?) Of course, the real stars of the film should be dogs. They serve as the "Macaulay Culkin" of this movie, pulling all the stupid "Home Alone" gags on the bad guys. (Biting them in the groin, running on their hands with luggage carts, spraying them with icing, etc. Etc. Etc., To the point of nausea.) I have to admit that the dogs were pretty good actors - much better than humans. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely wasted on this film as a French furrier out of his mind. The two human "dog lovers" - reworked from the previous film, but with different actors - are completely boring. When they have a spaghetti dinner in an Italian restaurant, the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home, watching the dinner scene from "Lady and the Tramp". I thought to myself, "Oh please, don't go there!" I had almost expected humans to do a satire on the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene - as Charlie Sheen did in "Hot Shots: Part Deux" - doing the "spaghetti kiss", pushing the meatball with her nose , etc. <br /> <br /> And don't let me start on the annoying parrot with the voice of Eric Idle. <br /> <br /> The costumes were nominated for an Oscar, and the costumes in the film * are good. But they are the only good thing about the movie. The rest is a drastic unbearable.
