The disappearance concerns a couple who take their family on vacation to New Mexico and find themselves in difficulty after taking a detour from the main highway to visit a city apparently abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. The town of Weaver seems harmless at first and has a tourist appeal until the family is stuck there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their own situation with fatal results. The Henleys watch a video diary of Blair-Witch-Project-esquire left by the last victim of the city, which ironically shows the best performance of anyone in this film. Although the performances of Hamlin and Dey are much better than the supporting casts, their emotional affection seems "flat" to me throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The disappearance has attracted most of the film as there is a lot of suspense and good direction. However, the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that apparently make no sense. Worse still, there's really no understanding of what's going on in the film, which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable. It seemed to me that filmmakers were so focused on creating a flow of suspense scenes that they threw away all the elements of good history: plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a coherent solution / result. <br /> <br /> The most difficult aspect of the film for me was the fact that the first three quarters of it were spent on accumulating tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were suddenly eliminated as if they didn't we had deserved an explanation: <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of Indian symbols on the walls? What happened to Weaver's original people? What was the connection with the people at the dinner? What did the sheriff know? What did the missing boy discover? <br /> <br /> This was, I believe, a bad move, since it caused some resentment. I had invested quite a bit in intellectual capacity in hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events, just to make sure that the filmmakers ended up simply without answering any of these things. These are some nice cliffhangers for the end of a miniseries that is about to start again next week, but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for an independent film.
