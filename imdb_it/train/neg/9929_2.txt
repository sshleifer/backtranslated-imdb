Watching it was like having a big mackerel slapped in the face over and over again. Even when you thought, "That mackerel definitely can't be around again," * slap * there it is. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the kind of pilot I saw and I asked myself, "Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be turned into a series?" Not only black but also Swedish and Indian stereotypes. And while "Blazing Saddles" turned these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were decidedly offensive. There was no plot, the ending was slapped, and the jokes weren't. However, if you're a comedy student, watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.
