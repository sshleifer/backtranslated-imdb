Right now I'm discussing if I should even finish watching this "poppycock" of a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea, with the movie set buried, and that's it. So far this incomprehensible disorder has no true story. There is the buried set, a monster with a wolf's head running around, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked by whatever it is. What I would have missed, if I had the good sense to expel this absurdity, is a pursuit of dune buggy, some bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialogues, other bad C.G.I., and heroes who fight paper cuttings. In addition to the original idea, this film has absolutely zero quality of redemption. My mistake to keep watching. - MERK
