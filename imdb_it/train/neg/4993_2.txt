I went to see this movie waiting for an action movie "nothing really very much", but I was very disappointed. The opening scene promised a small action with a touch of comedy. Keeps you hooked for the first half coz until that moment you're expecting now is the right time for the action to kick. Well, nothing like that happens. The movie drags and the ending throws you down to a point that annoys you. Think about what the director was thinking. It didn't make any sense. The film was missing in all aspects, it didn't have a real plot and it seemed very empty, even if "Rambo" was there, I don't think it could help the score. There is simply no logic to the film. A perfect way to waste time and money. By far the most irritating film I've ever seen and I'm sure there will be others who will have the same point of view after enduring it. Definitely not for people who have a little sense of cinema left in them.
