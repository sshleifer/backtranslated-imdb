The corpse of a young girl is found stripped of all possible means of identification. When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other, it is assumed that it is the body of the daughter who is missing a couple. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, he receives a call from his daughter! With the help of a former policeman and a journalist, he goes on a journey to determine if his daughter is actually alive. "Los Sin Nombre" is a plot mess, it moves at a painfully slow pace, and is completely contemptible. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an exceptional job as a desperate mother. The best part of the film is the ending, but I'm not sure the rest of the film is worth supporting. Beware of English subtitles on the recent R1 release - they are not very accurate.
