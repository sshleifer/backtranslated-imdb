Well, this film has certainly had a good deal of hype; From the buzz of the Toronto Film Festival to the exciting reviews on CBC Radio. Apparently a refreshing, extravagant, hilarious indie film. I couldn't wait to do it for months. <br /> <br /> How can I simply define it? He sucked in a very big way. An exercise in cinematographic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius. At best it was slightly fun and at worst inducing. A poorly directed Amerterian script modified into a rickety mess. <br /> <br /> And what was more with the 500 db music than the rest of the soundtrack? It was the only really strange thing about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a really funny and bizarre movie that involves aliens, try Repoman. There is no comparison!
