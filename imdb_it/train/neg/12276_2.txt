The film had great potential, unfortunately, it came to pieces due to a weak, implausible, miscellaneous and general lack of content / substance. One of the most obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, did not know how to pronounce his Arabic name! This may seem like a small flaw, but it indicates the apparent lack of effort to pay attention to details. The acting quality was evenly below average. <br /> <br /> The solitary saving grace of the film was the turning point in the plot at the end; and a French song (I don't remember the title). Overall, it was a pretty nasty movie where Sean Connery was visibly uncomfortable.
