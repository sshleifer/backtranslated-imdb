There's not much to say about this film, it's horrible. <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue are far from decent, the history of the hybrid werewolf is not very well explained and the whole thing has holes in the ground here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you don't want to see. It is so delightful to make me throw up. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the DVD was in the Extras. The gag reel. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope no one will buy this, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Stay away from me.
