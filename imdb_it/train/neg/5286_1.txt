I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just to see it without waiting forever for it to come to the United States. I really should have saved my money. What is happening to Anna running after Wentworth? The main point of the character of Anne Elliot is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? His speech was not normal, nor was his walking normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters that made their "love story" completely unbelievable. In the final scene they also have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress that Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes don't make the same film. In my opinion, they did not look at the 1995 version, which despite having its flaws, remained very close to the book. The book, I don't even think they read it. This is a bit like Cliff's Notes' Persuasion movie. Hit all the best points without explaining anything.
