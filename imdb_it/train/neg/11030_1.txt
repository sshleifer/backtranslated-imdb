I recently saw this movie at 30 minutes of the Gothenburg Film Festival and, to be honest, it was one of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are fun and funny bad movies (eg "Manos ?? Hands of fair") and then there are the bad bad movies. (This falls into the latter category). The cinematography was incredible, and not in a positive sense. It seemed that the cameraman had deliberately kept everything out of focus (with the exception of a free nipple), the lighting was something between "a boy running with a light bulb" and "not existing". The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as ugly as porn actors, and gave the impression that each line was a total surprise for them. The only thing that saved was the look of the masked killer, a classic Jason Vorhees look for "Friday the 13'Th". The plot was extremely poor and the end even worse. I would just like to recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of how a horror movie shouldn't be, or maybe a sleepless person who needs to sleep.
