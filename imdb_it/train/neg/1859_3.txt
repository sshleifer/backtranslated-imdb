This movie made me fooled. Honestly I thought it would be a horror campy movie with absolutely no sense of humor, boy, that time I had a cold shoulder. This film was, and I am sincere, damn good. It wasn't scary at all, but the witty campiness and humor were really crazy about this movie. Some of the horrible acting and cliché murders were so painful to watch, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but I liked it to some extent. The murders all refer vaguely to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more intriguing. The corners of the POV camera were fantastic. <br /> <br /> The film is about a viscous murderer who dies in a car accident with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. Later he rose in that same chemical with snow spliced ​​in the mixture. These were the ingredients chosen to make the killer snowman perfect. He took his revenge, like the snowman, from the police officer who sentenced him. <br /> <br /> This film had such bad acting, with the exception of Christopher Allport, which was fun. I must say that I am also rather disappointed that this film was not a horror film, but actually a dark sitcom. They had a nice story with a good storyline, but it wasn't done correctly. All in all I like the movie at the beginning, but now it's really annoying. But this film is definitely better and darker than the sequel.
