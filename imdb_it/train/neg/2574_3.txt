I know that movies don't necessarily have to reflect reality, but this got on my nerves. Perpetual ignorant stereotypes about "psychological traumas" and mental illnesses. The "psycho-mother" thing has been done too many times before (and usually has gone better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched. The acting was not horrible but nothing to get excited about. <br /> <br /> A highlight: I am a long-standing fan of the General Hospital and it was a journey to see one of the roles played by the former director of GH, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> However, if you can overlook the false psychoanalytic part of it, in the same way that a person has to suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this film could be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
