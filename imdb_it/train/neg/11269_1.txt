I must confess to having seen some screamer in my time, but this is up there with the worst of them. Worrying plot to follow. Sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the film put together badly. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look back at the final product and want to collect dust on a shelf to avoid being disturbed for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case, I have the DVD. He will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
