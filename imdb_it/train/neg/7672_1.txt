Obviously a lot of crew members behind the scenes have been working on this film, so don't even look at the end credits at the end, you'll only keep it against them. No one seemed interested in seeing this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two fainted after 10 minutes, and were the lucky ones. The "monsters" were the unemployed worm of Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected the designs for Alien's space creatures. The creators of the film obviously did not want to overshadow the monsters of third-rate films, so they hired actors who apparently failed to memorize their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before they started shooting. Some scenes are incredibly inept in transmitting only what should happen, if something is. If you are unlucky enough to find yourself in a theater where this film is shown, and you do not faint, laugh at what should be a scary or suspenseful moment in the film. The implausibility of different scenes will stun you and the regular shedding of Stephen Dorff of the "Queen Mary of the cursed words" conveys the feeling of one who pays to see it. If you have to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait for it to be in the business basket in the video store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main actors will be there to rent it.
