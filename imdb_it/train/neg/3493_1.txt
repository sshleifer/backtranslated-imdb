I rarely write reviews on IMDb.com, but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Simply terrible I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.), And I had high expectations for it since I found it listed in many "10 best Kung Fu / Martial Arts movies". (Now I am convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all, there is almost no action in the film. Most of the film is talking about the plot, which is an incredible feat because it is subtle at best. And the action itself may have been impressive in 1978, but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning for Netflix users: the DVD they send is terrible; the image is hideous and not even improved by 16: 9.
