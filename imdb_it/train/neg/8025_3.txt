Yes, even as a fan of shows like survivors and apprentices, this show is pretty ugly. I didn't mind for the first couple of shows, but then I realized how pathetic everyone was in the show in the first place. The antics of Alex and Aaron gave the men a bad name in the way they betrayed or left their choice at the first opportunity was not really a good idea for the show. <br /> <br /> Ryan, you can have Trista. He had the most annoying voice I've ever heard on television, and he definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very experienced in the media, but I doubt there's much more there). <br /> <br /> I haven't really seen any of the shows, apart from the occasional repetition of daytime TV. I think the point of TV reality is to treat it as "funny junk". Look at it as something you can laugh at and don't have to think too much (I don't look at CSI like it's a tired, clich√© reality TV, but you still have to think too much while you watch). <Br /> <br /> A couple of thoughts on some reasons for going to the show. At first 'the woman says it all' The woman like Amy (who had a lot of class about her) commented that she tried every scene, or the bar and club scene, to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her . Hey Amy, how about entering a club, doing a hobby? Do a charity job? Change your work into one where you meet more kids, all I know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner. <br /> <br /> Amy and many other girls seemed obsessed with meeting the "perfect man". Clue for women: he doesn't exist. There are, however, many good guys out there who would make fantastic husbands, some who might be right for you! they cannot earn six figures a year or be a JFK junior in the same way, but they are still good guys. The superficiality of the woman in this show is quite incredible. I'm still a young man, I was led to believe that the woman gradually grew out of their superficiality as they grew older and more realistic about their future partner. This show is proving the opposite. <br /> <br /> Overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes about how women see men in society. It's really a terrible sight and I think all these types of shows should simply stop being made. The best appointments for a country mile are Blind Date and The Fifth Wheel because they are fun. Nothing is better equipped than the "couples" of a simple night out. the bachelor sadly takes himself too seriously.
