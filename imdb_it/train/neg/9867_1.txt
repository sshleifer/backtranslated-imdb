I saw a screener of this before last season's award, I didn't really know why they had delivered them after the vote was over, but whatever, maybe for the show, at least, but the film was a twisted mess. Of course, some parts were funny in a way of black humor, but none of the characters seemed completely real to me. There was not a person I could get in touch with, and I think it was this that failed. Of course, the plot is somehow interesting and very subversive towards Scientology, WOW! What a great idea ... let's see if this has not already been undermined to the point of being unusable. The whole test is fake, from the lighting, the casting, the script to the horrible visual effects (which should be intentional, I can say it, and so also to everyone else, nobody laughs with you). Anyway, I hope it's on sale at least on DVD, I wouldn't want a project that many people obviously commit to doing unnoticed. But it is the tripe in both cases. Boring tripe to that.
