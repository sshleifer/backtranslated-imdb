What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was ok, but even at the beginning with disgusting effects to merge into a giant with normal-sized people (even the effects of Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But the really terrible part of the film is the dialogues. He's completely inconsistent, foolish and stupid. I felt like it was written by a student n. 9 in creative class and obtained a D-. I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie. <br /> <br /> I've had my share of bad and bad movies (I love the series of tremors), but this ... I don't recommend it at all It's stupid and the absolutely bad dialog boxes will make you shiver.
