What happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he realized the kind of typical fodder for summer action that could have been directed by anyone outside the film school ... and in fact, they probably would have done a better job. They would at least put half a thought into the terrible script. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who has crossed a sort of space tunnel and landed on a planet ruled by monkeys. (gasping!) Except this time, the monkeys are writhing through dialogues worthy of praise, senseless plots and flashy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could have been assigned to about 10 independent films that would be considered "masterpiece" beside to this tripe. <br /> <br /> Although I like Tim Roth's superb acting talent, his portrayal of the evil monkey leader Thade is nothing but an intense composition of heavy and heavy breathing. Fortunately for him, makeup allows him to maintain a certain dignity as an actor and most of the dialogue is hidden behind his moans and giggles. <br /> <br /> And alas, the tradition of Hollywood always reliable of taking the male and female leads and hooks them in the end without any relationship development or cause. And the "haha, we're so smart, aren't we?" how Hollywood links the original POTA references to this one. Sigh ... <br /> <br /> Instead of seeing him, he spends the night and calls some friends and rents "Ed Wood", "Edward Scissorhands", "Batman", or to a lesser extent "Sleepy Hollow" , and recalls the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality ... not ashamed and ridiculous.
