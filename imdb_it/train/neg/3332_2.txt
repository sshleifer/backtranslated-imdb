I bought this movie for the sale of a car, so I didn't expect it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977), but I thought it would still be nice enough to watch . However, it was not at all pleasant, but instead the acting and the general film were fake, like the way the "killer killer" kills his victims and how all the people killed are just young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. I say this for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women in danger, most of them killed. 2) One survives by crawling in the dark while being chased by the murderer. 3) Surprise surprise, help comes in the form of a gun! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I saved you two odd hours by summarizing this poor excuse of a horror movie, so now you're lucky enough not to have to watch it
