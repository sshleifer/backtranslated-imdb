An inconsistent mess with a deafening and deafening sound track, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry in the "who's dead and who's alive" horror film genre. Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, prepare to go to different colleges, but before they separate until Thanksgiving, they take part in a final adventure at a rave party in a burned out church at the suggestion of Annabel ( Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the other vampire slayer). The fearful and nonsensical kids start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons that are never explained, and in a short time the quartet leaves the party. Driving away in their SUV, they are chased and then passed by the creepy boys for no reason, who promptly and inexplicably make an intentional 180 in the middle of the public road, causing a bad and fatal accident while the SUV turns on an embankment and dives into a river . Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie spends the rest of the film facing loneliness and guilt (he drove) when she is not haunted by Sean's ghost or chased by those unsettling, senseless kids. A lot of inexplicable inconsistency follows when Cassie's mental state deteriorates further, until she reaches the predictable conclusion. So who died and who is alive? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who really cares?
