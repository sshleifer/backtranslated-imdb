What "Noise" fails to do is make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer manage the annoying city noises, especially the car alarms. It's a strange idea for a film, which has more creative credibility than "Death Wish". He is intelligent in points; especially a scene where our hero is trying to read through Hagel, "I'm too stupid to understand this." He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion, we read it and I don't understand it. Only then a car alarm goes off. Throughout the film the interference of city alarms and noise is constant. However, all in all it does little to help us understand our hero, which allows all of this to ruin his marriage and distract him with side plots instead of digging deeper into his person. <br /> <br /> The making of the film is too unconscious to notice its sound problems, poor editing and visible microphones. No, "Noise" is not bad at all. William Hurt is at least colorful. At least the ending does not collapse. Overall, take a logistical point home, which you probably didn't think of. At least I hadn't done it. Though all in all, ninety minutes, he couldn't have finished sooner. The plot dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> This is another movie you could see at a film festival, but it probably won't be picked up for distribution. Check it on DVD if you are really partial to someone involved in the project. Otherwise jump.
