Someone called Howard Koch a schlockmeister but he wrote the script for "Casablanca", didn't he? Or he didn't. Maybe there's more than one Koch that goes around Hollywood, and anyway I don't really like "Casablanca". Wait a minute - yes, there's another Howard Koch wandering around Hollwyood. That's what "Casablanca" wrote. It does not matter. I will put so much attention into this commentary as "Howard W. Koch" put into this production, which is just a little bit. <br /> <br /> Do you know how to play? Someone read Cliff's Notes on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and decided, since no original thought was on board the Inbound Inspiration Express, to update it and make it Hollywood with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> There are differences. Lear decides to divide his vast possessions between three sisters and asks them how much they love him before doing so. Two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and make a brown nose to get his money. The third is the good girl and refuses to become an operatic on Lear. But in the drama, Lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two conniver his hiding place and deprive the honest girl. He finds himself crazy and naked during a storm on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinations. Children can do it for you. (Take my son, for example, after all the effort I wasted to raise him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer?) In the end, everyone in the game dies. <br /> <br /> In the film, evidently, the good sister is dark and suicidal, but when she tries to break free, someone jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy. This is the difference between Hollywood and a real tragedy, unless we define Hollywood as a tragedy in itself.
