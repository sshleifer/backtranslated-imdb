You know the story ... Little boys alone in the woods, when BAM! Something starts to cut them. <br /> <br /> Well, this shit is no different. A group of boys returns to a cabin where the male leads twin brother who disappeared for years before. Suddenly an "UNKOWN CREATURE" reads by cutting them, and their only help is a doctor / biker. <br /> <br /> To say that this film was bad is an understatement, it's a hair! The acting was horrible. <br /> <br /> The creature seemed very mischievous. And like in all movies these days, they try to make you turn a corner, which they don't! <br /> <br /> There is a bright spot in this film: the star LOST Maggie Grace as the female lead.
