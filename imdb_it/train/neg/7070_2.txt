Boy oh boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the film was the hilarity of the bluescreen effects used to create the invisibility of the mother. They seemed to have been shot on cheap videos, and it seems totally unreal, and not even in a good way that is so funny that you find yourself loving the movie ... <br /> <br /> I did NOT end up loving this movie . Even "steadicam" attempts have been really pathetic. I mean, hey, if they have a low budget movie, that's fine. You can still make a fantastic movie with a small budget. But, a BAD film and a low economic impact. This represents a bad combination. In this case, a condemned combo created the craptastic movie, "Invisible Mom". If you have children, and your children have no taste for it, maybe they will stay awake during all this.
