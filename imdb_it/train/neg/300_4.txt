Robert Taylor certainly proved to be an excellent dramatic actor in his role as a gunshot buff in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times Taylor would play an important role in a film. Nevertheless, this photo was far from exceptional, immediately afterwards Taylor fled on television with the hit series The Detectives. <br /> <br /> Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned into a formidable performance as Taylor's partner. Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred of Indians really shows. <br /> <br /> Another very good performance here was the veteran actor Lloyd Nolan in the role of an old man, who drank old also in search of buffalo. In his first scenes, Nolan was indeed making an excellent take-off by Walter Huston in his Oscar role in the movie The Treasure of the Sierre Mother in 1948. Notice Russ Tamblyn's appearance in the film. The following year, Tamblyn and Nolan will join the phenomenal Peyton Place. <br /> <br /> Writing in the film is rigid at best. At the end of the film, it is the elements of nature that Taylor made into. What about the elements of writing here?
