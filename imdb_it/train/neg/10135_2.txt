I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through some things that I thought could be improved; acting, writing, directing, special effects, television crew, sound and lighting. It also seemed that the writers had no idea of ​​anything to do with the film. Apparently in 2007, when the dollar was stronger, you could buy a super-advanced stealth bomber that could become completely invisible for $ 75 million. Nowadays those things cost about $ 3 billion and cannot become invisible. Apparently you can fly from the United States to the Middle East in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I didn't mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to convince more guys to see it. The camera will perform random magnification of the actors and switch to random scenes. Oh yes, since it's a Steven Segal movie, it's predictable to die for. All in all I rate it right there with Snakes on a Plane.
