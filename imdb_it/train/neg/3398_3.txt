It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (mafia) character of the Russians, or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that the British police are so inefficient that they cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when they leave the country by air. Moreover, Nicole Kidman and the alleged Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by the Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far from the Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning the grammar of the Russian language and its pronunciation.
