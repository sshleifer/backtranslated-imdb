The only reason I'm commenting is because I finally understood why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because she showed these episodes in a different order than the one where she filmed them. The last episode in which our angry friend and lover of Jesus, Roberts, dies, Dr. Cox shaves her head. The must showed them out of order for some strange reason and they forgot to slip into continuity. For shame, Scrub. They made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and his hair is wet 2 seconds before the water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite program must intensify it.
