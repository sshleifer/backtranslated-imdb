This film had potential and I wanted to try it, but there are so many problems in the timeline that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow being treated like an idiot. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set between the mid and late seventies. In order for this film to be realistic, it should be set in the fifties, if not in the late forties. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, no sign of Rolando that Carlito allegedly ran on his "joyful day". None of the main characters of the original film was in this film. We should believe that Carlito met all these people within a few years. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power ends with Carlito walking along the beach talking about retiring to heaven which is what he wanted to do in the original film. Also, the pre-that creates the characters of Rocco and Earl - what should happen with them since they clearly aren't in Carlito's Way? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito can have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original film by watching the events of Rise to Power. Where are the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he spends five in prison. It's like trying to insert a square plug into a round hole. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in earning some money by making an average gangster movie and launching a character named Carlito Brigante in history. The film had some good moments, but I think it would have been better to leave this film to be alone instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you feel determined to see this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the film as a linear pre-that. Think of it as the spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's unnamed man, in other words two films that have the same character but are not necessarily connected to each other.
