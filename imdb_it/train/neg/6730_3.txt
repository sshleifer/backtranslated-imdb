This is a film about how men think women think about love. No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues I heard, only three really had some kind of truth going through them. I kept waiting for the movie to improve, and it worked a little, but never enough. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting concept, and I continued to want it to be good, but it never succeeded. Maybe if they were really love stories it would work.
