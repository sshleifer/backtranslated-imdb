If it weren't for "Oh So Gourgous", Natassia Malthe, this B-movie wouldn't be worth a single sector of my Tivo record! In what low rent deposit, back warehouse was the alleged space port turned? "Continuity People!" It is a basic principle in the making of real films! At night an alleged space port and by day (night and day on a space station?) A warehouse! ??!? Please! The only thing I will recommend this movie to is the wardrobe. for the continuous, keeping Natassia in dazzling shape, revealing clothes! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the clothes she obviously spent time with, every day of shooting! The science fiction channel would have been better to show SpaceBalls! At least there would have been real humor in looking at something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please fire your agent as soon as possible! You are much better than an actor, to also be associated with this level of film creation.
