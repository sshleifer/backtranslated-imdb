Comparing this squalor with an old low budget porn movie would be an insult to the old low budget porn movie. Animal scenes have no meaning or represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case reads in part "taking up the reticulation of the BTK Killer reign of terror". This is NOT a story. A rereading would suggest that you were told the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things is true. I'm an enthusiastic serial killer student and I've seen some pretty bad movies about them and honestly, this is NOT one of them. This isn't even the BTK killer. Save time and a few dollars and rent Dahmer. THAT movie serial killer is accurate and true. However, if you just have to watch this movie for yourself, take a free look at your local library and even then, you will still feel cheated.
