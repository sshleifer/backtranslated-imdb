What did the director think? All those who read Artemisia's biography were impressed by the courage to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture to prove that Tassi was guilty. This fact shows true independence and emancipation - in its most terrible hour it supports its MAN. Why do films depicting the Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the harder side of life or have Hollywood's happy mood? While I always defend the freedom of a director to create his reality in a film, I cannot make sense of the reversal of Artimisia's life story. Very disappointing choice by the producers of this film.
