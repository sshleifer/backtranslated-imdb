THE CRIMSON RIVERS is one of the most over-directed, over-the-top, over-all messes I've ever seen coming out of France. There is nothing worse than a French production that tries to make films in Hollywood and CR is a perfect example of a horror / action / smug film. I almost stopped him halfway because I knew it would be nothing but the French trying to show off. <br /> <br /> The film starts promisingly, as a sort of expansive horror film, but quickly moves genres, from horror to action, to the type of x-file, at a glance, to the fine, CR is all this and also none of that. It's so full of clich√©s that at one point I thought the whole thing was a comedy. The painful dialogues and those silent pauses, with fades and fades in the right expository moments, made me moan. I thought that only films made in Hollywood used this minced technique. <br /> <br /> The chase scene, with Vincent Cassel running after the killer, is so over-directed and overwhelmed that it's almost a thing of beauty. The peak at the top of the mountain, with the stupid revelation on the killer (s) with Cassel and Reno playing "companions" like Nolte and Murphy in 48 HRS, derailed the lack of credibility that the film had then. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that the director of THE CRIMSON RIVERS also directed GOTHIKA, which although it had its share of problems, does not even come close to the hurricane of this exaggerated and confused film.
