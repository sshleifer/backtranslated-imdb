I discovered this film because there was the Jew Ben Chaplin from Game On. Game On is a fun British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to join Hollywood and star in this movie. He failed thanks to God. <br /> <br /> The film is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo who plays an ugly woman who uses nearby Uma Thurman to go out with Ben Chaplin because she thinks that Ben Chaplin will not like it because it's ugly. The film is just bad for so many reasons. The plot is incredibly predictable from the bits openly dressed up to the serious mushy fragments: only that montage in which all three are having fun and then the picture is over. Those two scenes made me shudder! Janeane's character is incredibly arrogant (and guessing from his standing "comedienne" standing and even the arch-feminist is in real life). He says the film is "anti-feminist" when in reality it is only realistic. Men more often than not look beyond personality. It is also interesting to note his hypocrisy. She had been a feminist and "comedian" for years before playing this role and then suddenly decided that the film was bad. I guess you hated the idea and script of this movie before it was released, but made sure it kept you calm so you could get paid for this movie parody. I mean, come on! He recited us for heaven's sake! What this movie really was was anti-human, if nothing else. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with men who do stupid things to attract the attention of the character of Uma Thurman Noelle. <br /> <br /> There are other bad things about this movie, like the Ben Chaplin character who is the British man every American girl finds cute and Jamie Foxx is Chaplin's best black token friend and of course Foxx had to try to imitate his accent a few times for good measure. Is it the best that writers could come up with? Blimey has never done it before, except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore film ever made. There is also a really horrible phone sex scene that is simply grotesque and shows how cheap the movie is. The other comments on everyone here say that Janeane Garofalo is not ugly but actually she is beautiful. Erm I was watching the same movie as they were? He certainly isn't looking, and the only good thing about this film is that it was rightly chosen as the ugly one. Even if I said that, I can't see Uma Thurman's appeal: she is lanky and gaunt. I guarantee three things about this movie if you've never looked at it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what the ending will be; <br /> <br /> You will find the phone's sexual scene painfully awkward and <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
