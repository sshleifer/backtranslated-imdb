Start with the script. I've seen cartoons with more depth than "Envy". Every time the characters keep repeating what you've seen before, and it wasn't fun the first time, a movie is in trouble, which is definitely "Envy". A film that is based on a joke would be better to have a place to go. Here we have a film that is absolutely not going anywhere. In particular, Christopher Walken would like to forget this bomb, because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some beautiful black comedies, "Flirting With Disaster" and "Duplex", immediately comes to mind. Make sure "Envy" is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings, only total nonsense. "Envy" deserves its low score, because as if it were subject, it stinks. - MERK
