Could someone please prevent John Carpenter from continually and deliberately ruining his reputation? How low can you go? It seems that this man has lost all respect. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been done by a film student, it is not even worth starting to talk about WHAT, because it was just a borefest, directed by someone without talent as a director or without any motivation. .. <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retreat immediately with a little self-esteem and stop spreading garbage like this in a bad Escape from Los Angeles tradition to Ghosts of Mars. <br /> <br /> Get drunk instead.
