With a story and a script that seem to have been written by a high school student, "The Art of Seduction" fails to provide the romantic and sophisticated experience it seeks to assert itself. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female protagonists are "single sobbing (or in the case of the female protagonist, boyfriends)", but "The Art of Seduction" doesn't even try. Leaving a frank examination of the personalities of these two characters, "The Art of Seduction" avoids anything of substance for a base of thin and slender stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The Art of Seduction" is offensive, insulting to its characters, insulting to men and women and insulting to the expectations of its audience. It takes the wonderful wonderful people we all know and play their painful interactions while we expect them to worship us. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled and manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to like and forgive his faults because he is pretty. Min-jun, well, it's exactly the same. People are not beautiful either. The "humor" in this film revolves mainly around the bizarre attempts of Ji-wan and Min-jun to overcome one another in the honorable art of lying and manipulation. No character development occurs and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like that. We simply expect to take them as they are and not ask questions - they are cute!, And that's all that matters. The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in the reviews of azn cinema scenester can make you notice the superficiality of Art of Seduction. <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, you like Grease, or you're a victim of yellow fever, you'll like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the "Romance" tag, this is not a good dating movie.
