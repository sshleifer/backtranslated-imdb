What can I say? I'm a secret fan of "over the top" action and horror movies. Especially when it comes to a lot of humor and insinuations, but I'm not a fan of Snake on a Plane. <br /> <br /> There are three potential projects for this film: ?? The comedy of the situation; ?? Horror; is ?? The novelty of hundreds of snakes of an airplane. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this film is not written as an ironic horror or a comedy, and there are only 1 or 2 points in the movie you will be smiling at. If you want to get the feel of the movie, the trailer really represents the film, a horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you expect a film full of action and shock, you will not be disappointed. It does not stand out from other films, but always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, even if the novelty of Snakes of a Plane does not vanish, but leave the cinema to think "what all the fuss was about". <br /> <br /> I know this film has a high rating, but they do not add up. A) Many of the reviews written before the release of the film and, B) The user rating has a much lower variation than the normal 77% of people vote for the film 10/10, with only 7% of people that damage 9/10 - Why such a huge gap?
