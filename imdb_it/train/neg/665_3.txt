In Bridgeport, the late high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she sees him kill his family to be with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, traumatized woman feels better but is still under psychological treatment and is taking pills. During the night of the dance, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two pairs of friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has escaped from prison and is staying on the same floor of the hotel chasing Donna, stabbing his friends and hotel staff who cross the path. <br /> <br /> The forgettable slogan "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is superficial and silly, with a bad acting of Johnathon Schaech in the role of a crazy killer. The predictable script is surprising because it is possible to predict what will happen in the following scenes. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Death Convida Para Dançar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
