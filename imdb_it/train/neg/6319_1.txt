This film reminds me of how university students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if, after hearing some guys were doing without cheeseburgers at Cow Dung Collehe, the President would immediately change US foreign policy. The worst thing is that, although dangerous, the concept of a policy based on whether the USSR and the US entered the war could mean the end of the world, WORKED. The United States and the Soviet Union are NEVER GOING ON WAR. <br /> <br /> If we had only conventional weapons, the notion of another war, a "winning" war, in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I don't think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as a splendid example of "How not to make a movie". <br /> <br /> It should be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
