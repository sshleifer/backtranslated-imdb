I bought this movie for $ 5 in a used CD store, and I'm a little sorry. I'll start by saying that I'm a big fan of horror movies like that. They offer horribly bad economic entertainment. This movie had a good time for the first half hour, because it was so bad that it could be teased in a very simple way with an MST3K style. Then it became boring. <br /> <br /> Acting is the scariest part of the film. Although we can't expect great acting, this was ridiculous and, honestly, it provided all the entertainment that should have been done. This is the positive side of the film. Where the film is really fun in entertaining is writing, lighting and editing. <br /> <br /> This movie offers too many "What's going on% $ @ #?" moments. There are many moments, like the mother who has strange crises at dinner, and then the one that has absolutely no consequences in the film. In the wake of the dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat fine food for five minutes in a row without dialogue every time a meal was served. During meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene moves away from pure darkness outside. Then come back. And speaking of darkness outside, one of the most enjoyable parts of the film is the climate, where apparently it is not night unless it rains. And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the film is that it is so poorly lit that you can't see what happens in half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything else. In one of the climate scenes, you can't even tell what you should see that is so shocking. <br /> <br /> And when it comes to climatic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say "Wow, this surprised me, and that's good". I can say that the great revelation surprised me, because I didn't see it coming. The reason I didn't see it coming is because it makes absolutely no sense. I don't want to ruin it for you, but I'll tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding various parts of the movie to find something that would validate it, and all we discovered were other things that said it wasn't possible. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film is actually better when you watch it with the commentary teasing. I love shitty horror movies, but it was too much.
