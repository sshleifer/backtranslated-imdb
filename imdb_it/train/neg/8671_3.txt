I saw this movie on March 21st this year. I say I'm disappointed. Much better than "Tridev". Plot is chopped. Talk about Prabhat living with his father, Wife and his little brother. The film opens when it saves a bride. Anyway, Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother. He makes a plan by sending a few men. They come to school pretending to be friends with Prabhats. Kill him. His father throws him out of the house. Then come back. Ha and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. Dunny makes a good show, Chunky is at its most annoying, Naseerdun is wasted. Diva was good, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted but looked nice. The child who played Sunnys' brother in the film was nice. Sad had to kill his character. The girl was pretty but annoying. The other child did a good job. Alok did well. Kiran was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan did good. Cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya. Script is weak but has some good dialogues. Also drag the movie. The music was fine just liked a "Saat Samundar" song, the lyrics to that song were good. The other tracks could be forgotten. Don't look at this. Rating-3/10
