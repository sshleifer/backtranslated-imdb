City girl Meg Tilly receives a horrible phone call from her mother and, understandably shaken, returns home from her family's rural excavations, only to be faced with a mystery: why all the residents in the house behave in bizarre ways and disturbing? The radiation thriller, barely a nod to ecology, has the inhabitants of small towns going crazy, which (ridiculously) includes two women who look at each other with desire in a public place and Tim Matheson who receives the oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The image is too foolish for words, wasting Tilly's melancholy and the silent intensity of the garbage as he forces himself into a corner that he can't hope to get out of. A part of Thomas Del Ruth's photography is good (in particular a sequence of fire set in a garage), although he is disappointed by the disjointed editing - and by a quite touching ending. The simplistic script has no surprises or crumbs of originality. * 1/2 from ****
