Wow, I love and respect practically everything that David Lynch did. However, this film is similar to an early filmmaker's attempt to make a pseudo-artistic video. <br /> <br /> To give you a couple of examples: <br /> <br /> 1. David Lynch is generally a visual director, however, this has limited visual artistic content (empty walls, "photos in high "with the ceiling in the background) <br /> <br /> 2. Generally, David Lynch is very proud of the audio, in this you could even hear the hum of the video camera. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is very difficult to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless ... <br /> <br /> ... this is a joke, from David, to force fans to search for his website (for hours) just to find this drivel. I hope so, because at least that idea is fun.
