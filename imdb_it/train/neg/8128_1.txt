OK, don't let my summary fool you. This movie SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie ever? This film was terrible in the way people shouldn't have the courage to describe. But it is in no way worse than Manos: the hands of fate, hobgobblins, horrors of the spider island, or a small handful of films. As a review the film sucks, it's terrible. Don't see it without MST or you could develop health problems. But there are worse films.
