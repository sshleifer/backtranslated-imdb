ok, this movie f * ck in 'rules. is undoubtedly one of the most inept cinema pieces ever made. absolutely terrible, but you GOTTA see it. rent it with your friends and make an alcohol game or just have fun, it's fun. and the behind-the-scenes featurette proves it, you can do anything with paper plates and finger paint. awesome. ok, let's rent it just for this scene: two characters are actually WALKING IN PLACE for about 3 minutes in one click. the director (in the comment) says "yes, the tracking was so fluid that it seems they are ...". yes, right man, they are totally walking on the spot. it's so funny.
