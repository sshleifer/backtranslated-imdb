... but the key word here is "usually". I've been known to love movies. EVERYONE thinks they're stupid. But in the world of B-rated movies, THIS is ranked Z. Absolutely ridiculous. The thing I respect most of my favorite B movies is that they don't take themselves too seriously. Producers of films like this treat the film lightly, even if it is a heavy topic. I have the impression, however, that the producers of this film took themselves seriously seriously, as if they were putting together a 10-star classic, complete with few attempts at moving lines and stupid camera shots. Nevertheless, despite everything, I STILL gave 4 out of 10 stars, since I am biased towards films like this. If you are a fan of group B, however, I would try too hard to find it.
