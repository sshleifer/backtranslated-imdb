The story is very reliable and powerful. The technical side of the film is pretty good ... even the direction of this film. The main problem is with the castings, which have turned that film into another local and regular clich√© with a great lack of impact and a greater lack of impression. Besides the small role of the father, Rafael (played in an impressive way by Asi Dayan), all the other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the elderly Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh but without any intensity as a protagonist. therefore the figure who acted has become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that seemed more like a test, then a real movie. But after all, it's a good place to start and make big improvements in the future.
