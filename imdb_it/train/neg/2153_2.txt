The 3-D movie in "The Man Who Wasn't There" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This inept comedy features bad 3D effects that make 3D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" in a better comparison. Not to mention the film is asinine in the extreme. This was one of many films from 1983 with pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this mess, but at least he didn't kill their careers. Tambor would continue to star in "The Larry Sanders Show" by HBO and in "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" by Ron Howard, while Guttenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What do they have in those projects instead of in "The man who wasn't there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
