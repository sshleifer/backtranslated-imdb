There are bad movies, then there are the movies that are so bad, they almost become art. This is one of those movies. Me and my partner are still both types of shock bullets, you know, staring into space and drooling! It can be said that the people involved (I hope they changed names to protect themselves) were having fun, and they certainly weren't shy. I give this one three out of ten just because of free smoking and REALLY bad blood effect. I laughed out loud during most of the movie, so I guess you could say it showed me a good time. Attention to the viewer, the words above do not in any way prove that this is a good movie, because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass a movie with such a GREAT title!
