I waited for the film to be completely stupid. With such a low expectation, any form of entertainment would be a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack was the best part of the film, but it was also fun to make fun of the absurdities that happen in the individual sections. <br /> <br /> That said, there were many things about The Singles Ward that were completely annoying. The whole movie was badly nicknamed and made to look at the mouths while listening to their very irritating voices. This lack of professionalism has been overcome only by the cameos of Mormon celebrities who do not have corporate acting. <br /> <br /> This film will be good for the Mormondom, especially in the university communities where the individual department exists. However, the conclusion will offer no hope to the poor losers who find themselves unmarried. (Only the beautiful girls of the Singles Ward get married, the fat and ugly ones are not, but all the ugly men do it). Finally we realize that the whole film was an advertisement for LDSSingles.com
