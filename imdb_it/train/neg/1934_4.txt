Following is the usual formula to put a new recruit - this time the first African American (Cuba Gooding) after President Truman desegregates the Armed Forces - through the US Navy divers training program conducted by a racist fanatic (Robert De Niro ). If the program wasn't bad enough, it should be located in Bayonne, New Jersey. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with performances. Robert De Niro activates his southern accent and screams meaninglessly effectively. Cuba Gooding, raised by a strict father like a poor black peasant in the South, is the exact example of righteousness. The girls - they could hardly be called women - are Charleze Theron and Lonette McKee. They have minor roles and are mainly there to claim that their men should exercise common sense. Other decent artists - Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook - have even more superficial roles. <br /> <br /> That's it. Almost everything else could have been assembled by a computer. A ship is called a boat. Robert De Niro greets indoors, discovered. After a brutal assault on hospital staff, he is transferred out of his equipment instead of being arrested. Someone shouts "I'm out of here" in the early 1950s. (Perhaps it was a common expression at the time, if that were the case, "my evil"). People turn to each other by rank - "lieutenant", "boat mate", "commander", as they do in the army, while in the Navy they are simple "Mister" (if an officer) or addressed with their last name ( if you enroll). I didn't bother to check if there was a grade called "Senior Master Chief" in 1950. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a difficult row to hoe. Apparently, everyone in the navy hates blacks except a Wisconsin boy. He stutters and is held in contempt by the others in his class. It's like the scene in "Animal House", in which the candidate for a tony fraternity is invited to wait in a room with a Sikh, a black man and a blind child. <br /> <br /> Gooding is a recruited man, a second-class non-commissioned officer. He is able to marry a beautiful woman who has just graduated in medicine. In one of their arguments she begs him. He just wants to be a doctor and he should join her, leave the Navy and lead a quiet life. "And let life pass you by?" Yes. Yes, be a doctor's wife and let life pass you by. You can greet him from the Boca Raton golf course. <br /> <br /> These types of gestures were quite common in World War II. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner", that kind of thing. They were as cheap as they often were, they had some educational features. You learned something about becoming a bomber or a gunner. Here, the technical details are ignored, perhaps because the writer knew nothing about them (except the Boyle law, which we learned in high school chemistry). I could not follow what was happening during some of the emergencies without which a film like this would not exist. If I had mechanical problems, it's because I guessed. Management is not helpful either. The film abounds in close-ups, so many that they lose any dramatic impact they could have had. And the emergencies are confused because they are badly centered. <br /> <br /> Why go ahead? Want to see a better example of this type of film? Hardly anyone will - except perhaps "G. I. Jane", in which the abused hero is a heroine. Try the scenes of the training camp in "The Young Lions". There the victim is a Jew. Or try "From Here to Eternity", where simple sympathy buttons are not pushed and the victim is an adult man who refuses to bend and who is active in bringing the conflict, just like "Cool Hand Luke". There are no easy excuses, because easy excuses are too easy. <br /> <br /> Completely formulated and not well done.
