The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most horrible and amateur movies I've ever seen: ranking right there with Manos, the hands of destiny in terms of poor acting, useless direction and production values ​​at the kindergarten level. In this film, a clay-animated / stop-motion-animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum, California, and begins to dine on local barns. In the electrifying climax, the creature, described by a local as "a giant alligator with fins", drags its powerful mass on the ground to pursue its aspiring lunch, before a bulldozer hits it a couple of times and dies from boredom. Every character in this film is a complete moron. A useless subplot shows a hick going to a liquor store to buy a pint of Ripple of $ 4.75; instead of simply buying the bottle, the idiot shoots the cashier and another spectator, shoots a policeman, is chased to the lake, everything to be able to eat from the monster. The monster's unfortunate close-ups reveal that it is nothing but a piece of polystyrene. There is a fake magician grappling with a false British accent (to make it seem more legitimate), two renters of excessively clumsy redneck boats, some "prehistoric cave art" made of pastel-made cheese, and annoying banjo background pickin 'moosic. In a painful scene, the false magician and his smug wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to fill the film for another 4 minutes talking about how they can see the stars in the night sky, even though it is clearly still daylight. Even with a constant fast forward, this moovie hurts and hurts. MooCow says to call the fumigators, because this cow pie really stinks! : = 8P
