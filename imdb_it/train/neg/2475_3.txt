I was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and was not up to the plastered frame on the whole box. That said, the characters were well developed, the myth of Windego was used in a single premise and the house was rather ghostly but I missed it. I kept waiting for that big AHHHHH or BOO! But it never arrived. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the film was plagued by poor footage of poor special effects. Showing so much of a negative thing and not using the viewer's atmosphere and imagination to create horror and suspense. Try movies like Session 9 or Cubo if you're looking for a low-budget but well-designed horror film.
