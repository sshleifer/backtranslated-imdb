I was very surprised to see that this film had a good score, when I saw it on IMDb after seeing it. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. At first it looks like a good movie, but when it arrives in the operating room I can't believe how bad it was. This voiceover destroys EVERYTHING! Imagine being cut that way and then listening to what it says. I saw the film in German, so I really don't know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, right, it doesn't hurt .."? ... what is this? Telling yourself "think of something else" and then forgetting your pain just by thinking of your girlfriend is just ... stupid. And his mother ... how the hell do you understand something like that? Someone comes to tell her that her son died in surgery (the one she was expecting). He also found letters in Jessica Albas's bag. in addition that "you know the hospital" stuff ... and then it takes "a second" to understand it? What the hell? ^^ And the ending ... why do the police tear them apart? The patient died in surgery, that's all that happened. That drunk doctor knows nothing else ... and then they all tear them to pieces, even the girl ??? Why??? Despite all that I think Christensen has done a bad job, but that doesn't matter to me ... those mistakes and the stupid things I wrote above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were VERY disappointed ... Like I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Don't watch it at all;)
