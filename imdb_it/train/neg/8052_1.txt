I sat in this turkey because I hadn't seen it before, and because the premise seemed to have potential. It was pleasantly fun until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow the windows out of the house, yet the trees in the background are perfectly vertical and not a leaf moves! In fact, when the characters move out of the house, the light of the sun illuminates the tops of the trees. At that point, any of the filmmakers' beliefs had evaporated more quickly than the highly localized rain in their film. Too bad that all hurricanes are not like this, surely they would help our homeowners insurance rates here in Sunshine state.
