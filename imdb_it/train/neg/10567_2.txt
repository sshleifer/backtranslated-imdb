I thought this movie looked like a case study on how not to make a movie for the most part. Since I'm a director, I give him a 2 for consistency. <br /> <br /> The problems remain from beginning to end with the extremely predictable plot using fragments of many, if not all, previous successful war stories. The computer generated graphics were too similar to the display of a video game in points and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add a realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what he had to work with, but I couldn't find that information. <br /> <br /> It seemed that this project had pushed the limits of a low-budget film too far, resulting in a production that drags the viewer along with the story without their imagination. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
