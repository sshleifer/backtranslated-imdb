Well done Al Gore! You became the first to make $ 1 billion of the global warming lie! Just like all the other men have done fables in the world, this is up there with the best lies for sucking so many people. Of course, polution is not a good thing, and I'd like all the trees to continue to grow, but global warming is a business! It employs thousands of people who are all very misleading. <br /> <br /> Google it! There are only many things that simply don't add up, but well done Al, you failed as a politician, but you continued to make a lot of money sucking the world. <br /> <br /> What's next? Is Santa Claus Real?
