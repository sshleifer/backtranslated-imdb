"Die Sieger" was highly recommended for being one of the few good action films made in Germany. I saw him last night and I must admit that I am deeply disappointed. If it is supposed to be "the last best hope" for entertaining and challenging the German action movie, well, not much left. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" tries to be sexy, daring and furious but it's nothing like that. The characters are wooden and stereotyped and every time they do something unexpected (something that doesn't happen too much) the act against their nature. This makes it difficult - for me almost impossible - to follow them or identify them with them. <br /> <br /> Above all I think the film is a bad cast. There is no character in which I believe. Perhaps the top officer of the SWAT unit - but that's all. Those people trying to appear or act like special units, like elite cops - I don't believe it. Not for a second. <br /> <br /> The story is not so bad. But I think it's badly said. You don't know the bad guy at all - for example. And when, after a "very dark" show, Karl Simon (the good guy) asks his already dead opponent "why? ... for what?" I asked myself this question, knowing that Dominik Graf would not have the answer. I sincerely hope - no - I believe that Germany can do better, even with action films.
