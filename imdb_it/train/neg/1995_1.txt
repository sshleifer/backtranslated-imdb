Well, I just paid a dollar for a DVD of this movie, and it wasn't even worth it. It seems to be of poor quality and is in the public domain, I imagine. <br /> <br /> Neagle - despite his glory, his prizes and his reputation - is a homely English girl who can't sing or dance or act. <br /> <br /> Some of the good old Hollywood actors shown here must have thought they were making a classic. Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's husband) always thought that Anna was the most exciting and talented femme on the screen. He was wrong. It was unlikely to be popular in Britain before and after the Second World War. His "serious" roles are even more ridiculous than his musical appearance here. <br /> <br /> Only a couple of the famous songs are included and neither is well presented. Skip this and find the one that marks Doris Day. At least get real dances in a comic and professional style!
