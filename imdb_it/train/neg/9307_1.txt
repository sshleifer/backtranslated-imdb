I rented this movie about a month ago when I had nothing else to do on Friday night. All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH' Acting is so wicked that I saw children in high school do a better job. The whole cast seems to be just reading their lines, no feelings, no emotion and there is no space to capture the viewer. On another note the special effects were insanely mischievous and everything seemed to have been shot with a camera anyone can buy a radio shack. <br /> <br /> The clown himself does not resemble that of the video cover. Hell, he doesn't show up in the movie until the end and everything he does is humming songs and going around chasing some character. There is not even a real murder shown, so even this is not a real rocking movie. Since I saw it I have questioned some things 1. If it is "Serial Insane Clown Killer" Wouldn't it be a serial killer killing clowns? 2. If your friend disappears why should you go to the woods to have sex rather than look for it? Really sad. <br /> <br /> 3. Why is it the only REAL acting spitted in vain in the end suddenly? Has the cast finally decided to show an effort in their jobs? This film is as sad as they come. My advice is to avoid renting it so as not to waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than screaming.
