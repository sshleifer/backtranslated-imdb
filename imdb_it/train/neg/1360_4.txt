A reasonable effort is summary for this film. A good movie from the Sixties but with no sense of success. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was quite credible but not as good as it could have given, other actors were just terrible! A terrible portrait. It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really reach its genres as it wasn't particularly fun and wasn't dramatic. The only genre achieved at a satisfactory level was romance. The recipients were not affected and the film sent confusing messages. A very simple plot and a very simple plot were not drawn or performed at all well and people were confused as to why the film was not good and who the target audience was, etc. However Maggie was quite good and the plot was fine with capacity moments. <br /> <br /> 4.
