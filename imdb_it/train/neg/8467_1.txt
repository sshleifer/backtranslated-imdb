My friends and I rented it from Blockbuster because we saw the name of Nana Visitor on the box. This film is a parody I hope you deny from your CV. <br /> <br /> The "plot" was lost and flaccid, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable in some parts. The film made absolutely no sense. The approximate plot of a species of alien parasite that infects humans has been made many times by films with much better screenplays than this one, for example, the invasion of drug dealers and faculty. <br /> <br /> If you ever have the misfortune to come across this movie, I suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> How it ranks as a horror movie when there was no use of fear, suspense, blood, terror or any of the usual technical horror films I don't know, yet if you still find yourself if you want to watch this movie I suggest you have a lot of sugar in your hand, so you can find parts of it fun.
