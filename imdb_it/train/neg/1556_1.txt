I was Chinese in this film. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and could not correctly pronounce my real name, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was a lot of fun to shoot. They gave me "acting lessons" every morning (which obviously weren't useful). They nicknamed my voice (thank goodness). David and Peter were an explosion on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax that was canceled based on privileged information. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had "acting" in it.
