I see where some people involved in this debacle have written reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was useful for understanding it. The fact that they basically come up with excuses, rewritings, budget constraints, production formats, etc., simply underlines how bad this film is. And my criticisms in panning are not personally directed but simply a warning that this does not make the cut. <br /> <br /> It is watchable, but barely. There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram that interacts with a reconnaissance team is drowned in silly dialogues like a meal in the middle of what should be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would you have beaten us with the Hamburger Helper Sally, who were killed by these automatic street sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gadgets and red plastic wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once in the last rooms they treat the place more like a four-star motel than in a deadly meeting area. <br /> <br /> The rationale for meeting the fearsome Rook is that he cannot be killed alone. Yet, just one scene ago, the hero who made that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Eh? Vivian Woo was attractive and with hands down the best character played in the film. But it's not saying much.
