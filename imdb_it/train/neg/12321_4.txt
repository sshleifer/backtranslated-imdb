Since I hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and be disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this film was terrible. Really terrible. And not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I might agree with him, given that he gave the film the rank he deserved, but he was painfully scolded after reading what he said. I am ashamed to take the same side as someone who commented that the film "definitely lacks beautiful women". Let me be the first to say "Wow! This was definitely a serious in-depth examination there. My mind can barely understand the philosophical reflections on this film." Seriously, however, the lack of "good-looking women" should not be considered essential for a film. If you are desperate enough for "good looking women" you should really look at other types of movies, not necessarily fit into the science fiction category.
