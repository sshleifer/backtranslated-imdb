It is fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece. I am not a dullard with regard to quality films, and I agree that from the point of view of technical recovery, as with many of the characters portrayed, the film is in a class worthy of gratitude. But it makes no sense (to me) for this film to actually go anywhere; I mean, take the viewer anywhere. It's a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more from a movie. I look for history and movement and a fulfillment of the arrival, none of which I found in this film. Yes, it could be considered poetry on film. . . but there is a lot of poetry with which I cannot live together for the same reason: that paints images without going anywhere. <br /> <br /> One thing still to be said is that it documents a mid-century English childhood, which is necessarily limited in its universality. Personally I was upset about what a young British boy had to live, at that time and in that place. Having grown up in America only a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense. I can't help but wonder if this contrast had any effect on those who have reviewed the film so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its "filmic magic" (which I recognize to be there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of its recalled experience?
