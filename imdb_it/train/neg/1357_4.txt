* Can it contain a spoiler of sorts? * The mere mention of Crispin Glover is enough to send some panties of the geek into a pile. His landmark in Back to the Future as George McFly sealed him forever in American consciousness. More recently, he has tried to return to the subconscious of culture with Bartleby and Willard. <br /> <br /> This time, however, Crispin made a 76-minute dada movie, inexpensive. Sometimes he reminded me of genius, while on the whole he almost insulted me, but not because of its content. Satisfy? What is that? is a film in which, in one half of the film, all the actors have Down syndrome, giving it a strange feeling. The other half of the film includes Crispin Glover, Adam Parfrey and a boy with cerebral palsy. All this had the feeling of what John Waters was trying to do with Desperate Living, and at the same time feeling luckier and failing miserably. <br /> <br /> Even half of the actors of Down syndrome have many snails killed. This is a boy who has snails and ends up killing one. He's also tormented by a bunch of other people and a grasshopper. He falls in love with 2 girls, one of whom has sex with a cemetery. He also has a crisis with a friend who teases him. <br /> <br /> In a strange semi-interior set, Crispin Glover is the director of this show. It's something like controlling the boy's mind, and cerebral palsy is something like sexuality. Well, at least he masturbates in explicit scenes. There are other "shocking" images made humorous, like the Nazis Swaztikas crossed with Shirley Temple, and the minstrels in the black face who claim to be Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> In the outside world, the tormentor is still dealing with his love of killing snails and being beaten by other people. They beat him with stones and so on. Later, they beat the minstrel after processing him. <br /> <br /> Coming back inside, Crispin Glover is still the ruler of his set, and tries to control everyone, but fails miserably. <br /> What is it? it makes less sense than Dr. Caligari and has stolen more than one style of passage. The claustrophobic mental space is very similar to the way in which the wallless sets of Dr. Caligari felt claustrophobic. They also had absolutely absurd dialogues. And, it was all wrapped in absurd images of humor. <br /> <br /> The problem is, about 20 minutes in the movie ... maybe a little more ... What is it? runs out of images For the next 56 minutes, we continue to run on the same set of images, introducing only new images in the form of an absurd puppeteer. The film seems little more than a film that tries to push the envelope into offensive and taboo images. Try to mock and confuse the public. But the problem is that it only has a sufficient number of different images for a 40-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Worse still, the cinematography, the set design and everything else seemed very cheap and almost unexpected. It seemed "OK, this is how we can do it and get it out of the way". It didn't seem interesting, and it was rather ... boring. The dott. Caligari, on the other hand, had an extraordinary cinematography and framing. The difference between the two is quite staggering. <br /> <br /> evaluation: C
