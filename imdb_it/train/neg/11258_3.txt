I've said it in other reviews, without a story, you can give the public all the smoke and mirrors you want, yet no one cares. <br /> <br /> The director seems to have a great eye for the art deco of the 1930s (which I love), and I think the idea of ​​using all the digital backgrounds and the like could really be the wave of future in the cinema. However, it is obvious that the director was so interested in the digital rendering of his film, he forgot to film many scenes that would have greatly helped this surprisingly plotted film. (SPOILER) To shout loudly, they forgot they had a villain in this thing! OK, they have one, but he's been dead for 20 years when the movie takes place. Conran lacks the sense of having a villain. As for the action, let's see, Sky Captain (Law) shoots down a robot, two or three of the airplanes (before Dex (Ribisi) tells him to stop shooting him !!!), and a couple of robots, but for the the more he spends his time looking hastily and leads others to fight his battles for him. Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or all that is completely wasted in this film (the reviewer who comments on his and Law's lack of chemistry is so right) and I was the first to get tired of seeing repeated shots of the upper part of his camera, showing SOLO HAS TWO SHOTS TO THE LEFT, both of which turn off later in the film, one in a strange way, one rather amusing, even though I saw it coming 70 years later. No one except Law and Paltrow has significant time on the screen, and this is the real flaw of the film. An audience does not identify with robots, they need a hero to cheer for and a visible and despicable villain to hate. Without this, in addition to a beautiful compelling story, all the CG in the world will not help.
