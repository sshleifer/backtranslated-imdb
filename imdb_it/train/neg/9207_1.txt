This movie was sold for a dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD so I don't feel like I lost anything for watching this movie, except my TIME. Enjoyed the acting of Tom Hanks, (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young and gave an exceptional performance considering it was a horrible script. The story is about university students who have decided to play Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic context. Robbie Wheeling has had problems in the past playing this game in other colleges and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very pretty girl and has a romantic adventure with her and once he starts playing, he stops making love with her and behaves like a Monk. There are some scenes from the film that were filmed around the former World Trade Center and also the observation area and the roof. It is rather sad to see this part of the film where so many human beings have died because of evil in the world. This is not a great film, except for Tom Hanks who tries to keep the film above the entertainment level.
