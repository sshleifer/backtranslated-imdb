This film has some great noirish / neorealist visions, and tells a story that is refreshing without Hollywood's sugar coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some scenes continue for too long (marriage in particular), and I found exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialogue to be more suitable for the stage than for the big screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly annoying, and seemed to get worse as the film went on. Most of the characters were Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing the lines for a Shakespeare play while mixing cement and brick. Towards the end I was laughing, and not because the filmmakers wanted me to do it. I imagine that the poetry drawn up can be defended by stating that the characters would have spoken in Italian and that dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really speak. But it absolutely didn't work for me. Another line of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly takes a break. English accent. I only imagine that this has something to do with the fact that the film was made in England. I give this film an "A" for effort and intention, but a considerably lower degree for execution.
