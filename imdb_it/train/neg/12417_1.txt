Any film that starts with a cowhand who fucks a female calf can't promise much. As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it wasn't like that. OK every kibbutz had only a small piece of something shown in the film (like the young people who break into the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as full of all those - let's say - bad traits. Each kibbutz had its problems, but almost all kibbutz had all of them. The views of Israel were great. I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called Emek (valley). Yes, and the acting was good too, so you see that it wasn't all black - just a wrong portrait - probably intentionally too.
