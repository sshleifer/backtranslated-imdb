I found this movie quite strange. From the beginning I found it extremely difficult to appreciate this film, and now, after some reflection, I can see why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to death (I think Zentropa is one of the best films ever made) is quite uncomfortable here, and even if I can't understand who would be better for me, I'm sure someone could take his place quite easily and make this movie work. Everything else is fine, except for the stabs at the weak comedy (A Meet The Parents Joke is not really necessary, the directors!) And I really like Richard E. Grant as a British major. He only suffers from one thing ... Jean-Marc.
