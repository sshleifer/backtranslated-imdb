The fire of St. Elmo has no influence on life after university (for most of us ordinary people). Why was this garbage made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I'm really sorry for the actors dealing with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this "film" who have done a good job elsewhere. It must have been just a joke for them on the set. <br /> <br /> I really found this "movie" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I had from this is to hope that Sir John Hughes had a good laugh when he saw a screening of this same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was published. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made by looking at this because you like movies from the 80s. It is really so offensive to the genre.
