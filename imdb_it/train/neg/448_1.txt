What I hate about this show is how bad the leads are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is that they throw themselves at the boys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant in "All That" and in her show. Because they would have written her and Jenny Garth as lazy, listless, desperate, chasing men, aspiring "old maids" are beyond me. <br /> <br /> Their plots and dialogues remind me of "The Simpons", says Homer whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask, where is Poochie?" Everyone talks about whining about a boy, and then they complain to someone. Sometimes they change it and the boy complains. Then they come back together or separate at the end. The 2 women are either unsafe, stupid or sexed. The only word I can think of is "sucks".
