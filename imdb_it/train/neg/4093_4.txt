The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as "plot" and "character". The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark, blurred and blurred. The fact that Fulci has filled the entire film with fog doesn't help. On the other hand, the whole is completely bizarre and full of sex and violence. The inconsistencies are pretty funny, one of the main characters says he has no friends, yet he clings to the new guy in a minute on screen, and has a whole bunch of women on the side. Although he shows his antisocial tendencies by randomly putting an arrow into a poor b ***** that is just taking care of his business! The images of blood or blood flowing receive more attention than the characters, but what do you want from Fulci? . Maybe he ruined his career, but he wasn't much more stupid than Zombie. It's worth a rental if you like crazy Italian movies or you're desperate for sword and witchcraft or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone who gets sucked into a pit 2 meters from your head and yells for help?
