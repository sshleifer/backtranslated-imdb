This movie is so ugly, you can't imagine it. The acting is terrible, even worse than that of third-class soap operas. It is a pity that this film has had the most success in the last 20 years in Switzerland. The interactions between the soldiers made no sense. The story could have been extracted from a good photo story, the dialogues were wooden like Treebeard and the potholes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But nowadays it doesn't need much to satisfy the public. The actors were beautiful for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung (woah !!) and there was certainly a lot of drug abuse. This is a real cool man! Especially for teenagers aged 12 and 13. But the media created an atmosphere in which you were not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the dynamics of peer groups by implicitly saying that you are a nerd if you don't get along with the other "sheep" and you say. exactly as I was when I was in the army / this is exactly what I will do when I have to go to the army ... to any approximate action that has to do with drugs and coldness. And don't think I like the army. I was there and I hated it, but this movie is worse than cleaning the sticky toilet with a toothbrush (which I was forced to do because I offended a lieutenant). Not every film needs to be sophisticated. Sometimes you just want to be entertained for a few hours and forget the problems and I think it's not a bad thing. But this kind of film greatly influences teenagers by showing them a fresh lifestyle that is actually just stupid and turns them into ignorant and self-centered mindless idiots. But since now that my opinion is not very popular I will now be quiet and I advise you to avoid this terrible movie at any cost and for this to save your wits! <br /> <br /> 2/10 <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
