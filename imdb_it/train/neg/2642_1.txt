Slow, slow, slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you don't understand who the "mole" is, in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead. Even the secret service had to be, because it took the whole movie to put it together. There are no convincing characters in the film (not in the film). The rhythm of the film is slow, there is no tension. The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming for Michael Douglas at what he seems to be able to hit are large panes of glass. The most enjoyable scene in the film is when the presidents' wife says the code word to the anticlimatic ending. It's ridiculous loudly ridiculous. At least six people got up and left the film early. I would have joined them if I wasn't sitting in the middle of the line. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
