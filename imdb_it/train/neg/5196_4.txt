Although a little more technically polished than the previous film in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade both in a less exciting storyline and in a leading man who simply doesn't have the charisma of Ray Milland. <br /> <br /> That said, different actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to fly the flag. Also present is John Barrymore, who appears throughout the film in a variety of extravagant costumes. <br /> <br /> In any case it is another endless night for BD while he and his cohorts go around trying to save the poor girl he intends to marry. The clues are stupid but again the support actors often make them fun.
