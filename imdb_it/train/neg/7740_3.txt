This movie actually manages to be a carefree fun for 2/3 of the journey. Unfortunately, the film ends up being too "confused". While I know that some of the plot conspiracies are a standard for "cop friends" films, I was attracted to characters who intertwine with each other brilliantly but eventually the film relies too much on the chase sequences like a crutch and I lost interest. /> <br /> The filmmakers did a great job of taking the characters by themselves and doing their thing and we had the chance to see who they are and identify with both cops early on. We formed our opinion instead of being forcefully fed from a standpoint through constant arguments. <br /> <br /> In the end there are too many things that are detrimental to what could have been a pleasant piece of escape. Here's what's up with Joe Gavilan (Harrison Ford) at the end of the film: <br /> <br /> 1. His real estate deal 2. His relationship with a psychic radio 3. He is investigated by internal affairs 4. L Investigation of the Murder <br /> <br /> If you add the concerns of Casey, you become fond of wanting to be an actor and avenge his father's death. Now some of these things come together and unite well, but all the elements of the plot unite in the midst of this insignificant pursuit so long and pathetic that I hardly have time to break my boredom and give a shit to what happens. The awesome screenplay stunts can't get through the bad movie. <br /> <br /> As if a ridiculous pursuit sequence were not bad enough, one that had four separate sections and could last almost half an hour, it wasn't bad enough, Joe Gavilan's camps talk about his real estate deal while chases the culprit with a gun. All these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me if the criminal is captured or not. We have already forgotten or we no longer care about the plot of the murder, at this point because more lines of storylines and chocolates from the pursuits have numbed us beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> While I could continue with the chases and ruin a decent story, I will not. This may have been a very entertaining formulated film but it has outgrown its pimples and turned into a redundant waste of time. Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett actually did quite well and a small appearance by Gladys Knight is noteworthy. Unfortunately none of the actors can help this film to be forgotten hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Although this will probably be better than those like "The Hulk" and "Lara Croft II" that still don't make this movie good. Once I heard that Harrison Ford claimed to make only films that they thought could make money, I'm not sure if it's true or not. What is true is that to get a big box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither its main roles. My advice to Harrison Ford would be: stick to Indiana Jones because at least you can still run.
