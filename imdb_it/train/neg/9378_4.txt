This is another Northeast Florida production, mainly shot near Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised that the company was able to conquer the main street of Fernandina Beach for as long as it took to reach the street scenes. The film is cute and pretty ugly. Tami Erin is cute, but exaggerates. Eileen Brennan overhangs even more. Good for small children, or for those who love fluff in large doses. A 4 from the Miller-Movies formula.
