As some other comments show, this movie could scare you when you are a small child. (And that's probably all good for it.) <br /> <br /> However, if you're older, this movie only does one thing: suck it significantly - so I don't mean acting, its soundtrack , cut or s.th. how's that. I'm simply talking about the "plot" (if you can call it that). <br /> <br /> SPOILERS forward ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if after reading this, you really want to see this movie) but if you graduated from a school, this is just a great insult of your intelligence. While watching this, I was stunned most of the time, because what was happening was just THAT stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> - the formation of UNITE (a bad UN-association) <br /> <br /> -> we just have to believe that it is evil. Is it even evil? if so: why is he evil? <br /> <br /> - the mark of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> it is not necessary to impose this on the people, so why the hell (it is not a pun) they are doing it ? <br /> <br /> - invite Christ to your heart only as a service to the lips <br /> <br /> -> because there is nothing anyone, who in this film is considered "a true Christian", never, besides saying that stupid prayer. so ... just say that prayer before the kidnapping and you're saved - no matter what ?! <br /> <br /> So, vote 1/10
