Just kidding! This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was so ugly though, that it was fun. My friend and I rented it specifically because it looked so bad. The old cheese horror movies are always good for a few laughs. The plot smelled, some of the items were nicknamed, the quality was horrendous. But surely I enjoyed watching it!
