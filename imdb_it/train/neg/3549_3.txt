Do you like getting up? So stay away from this ... <br /> <br /> During the first few turns, there are actually good comics, but unless they have nice qualities, they have a chance at snowballs. Any controversial material and you are out! ... and I think I hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when I see who the rogue judges are letting in. <br /> <br /> 1 of my best 4 went beyond the preliminaries. Half + of the finalists gave me 0 laughs. Many of them raised their material elsewhere, something the judges don't seem to have problems with. <br /> <br /> It's a lot more fun than most on TV, but incredibly hard to watch without contemplating what could have been. <br /> <br /> If the producers changed the name of the competition to "Last Clown Standing", all my criticisms would lose their validity. Maybe an idea?
