"The Triumph of Love" does not triumph over anything. It is a tortuous, ponderous, 4-hour torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours in length, it just seemed a lot longer. It also pains me to think of amateur performances by actors as good as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Support players are not that horrible. Maybe they were trying to be so exaggerated, so as to be clownish, but, if that were the case, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino does not make an impression in one way or another. She (he) is there. My hypothesis is that the work of the same name, written by Marivaux about 270 years ago, is much better. It couldn't be worse. Clare Peploe, writer and director of this film, was inspired by a recent production of the show. I don't know what he was thinking when he created this bomb. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything got lost in the translation.
