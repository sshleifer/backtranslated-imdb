I bought it on DVD for my brother who is a big Michelle Pfeiffer fan. I decided to watch it myself earlier this week. <br /> <br /> It is a reasonably fun piece that contains two completely separate narrative lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the most interesting of the two. She plays an emerging Hollywood actress who has had many brief unsatisfactory relationships. He literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (a boy regularly married to children) after driving his car in the back of his car. After being initially hostile to each other, he offers to take her home because he no longer feels comfortable driving. Romance eventually develops leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happened at the end I was not prepared, but the slow pace and the normal direction of the TV bring out all the drama. <br /> <br /> The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the best cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer and Stella Stevens. They all want something from the head of the studio but in the end when asked to resign, everyone realizes that their careers will not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Time passes but it's not that interesting and I'm glad this wasn't bought for me. I'm not a fan of Michelle Pffeifer, but she was openly the only actor worth seeing in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress. Overall though, unless you're a fan of yours, avoid it because it's very routine.
