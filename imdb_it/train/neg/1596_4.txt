Not one of the best pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon enter history. You can see how strong Celebi can be, even if it becomes bad first. <br /> <br /> Even Suicune makes an appearance, it didn't seem so powerful. <br /> <br /> The Marauder didn They have many powerful pokemon, except for that taranitar? Some combat scenes with his Pokemon may have improved it. <br /> <br /> Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, even if they don't realize it. Misty thought it was over but didn't come close. I saw this in the credits. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
