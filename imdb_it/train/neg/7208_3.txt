I grew up watching the old Inspector Gadget carton as a child. It was like getting Smart for kids. A bumble boob cannot solve the case and all the work is done by the walking talking dog Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard that the live action movie was decent so I checked it in the library. I rented this movie for free and felt that I should have been paid to see it. <br /> <br /> Broderick is nowhere near as good as Don Adams' voice as the gadget's voice. His voice was completely wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like the Penny comic. It is brunette where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does a decent job given what she had to work with. Dabney Coleman gives a good performance as Cheif Quimby. Saldy never hid in some strange place or had explosive messages thrown at him accidentally by Gadget. <br /> <br /> The mobile gadget was wrong. He never spoke in the series and it worked well. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> Gadget was too smart in this movie. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had an intellect halfway. It would have worked better if he was a moron. <br /> <br /> Even the butcher has been completely struck down. Borderick says "Wowser". It is and should always be "Wowsers". It seems lame without the "s". I was disappointed when they showed the previews and didn't have the correct sentence. <br /> <br /> The only decent gags were during the closing credits. The deceased for Claw is in front of a support group for the recovery of henchmen / helpers. Seated in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil, known as Jaws of Bond, a film by Herve Villacheze, Oddjob, Kato and others. This is the only part where I laughed. <br /> <br /> The other one is at the end, where Penny is checking the gadget and telling the brain to say something. Don Adams tells the dog that "The brain is not right now. Please leave your name to the sound of the plot. Of course this is not a funny laugh, just a good piece of nostalgia for listening to Adams in the film. He should have at least dubbing the stupid machine. <br /> <br /> Children will appreciate this, anyone who is not older than 13. <br /> <br />
