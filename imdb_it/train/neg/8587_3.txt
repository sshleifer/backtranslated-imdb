This type of narration is unacceptable The only reason this film is anywhere above 5 stars on 10 lines is because George Lucas is behind it, with the words "Star" and "Wars" in the title. This is an insult to aspiring filmmakers and many others who have made clearly superior films with superior history, writing and acting, but have not had the merit. This is a parody. <br /> <br /> First of all. History. Anakin's evolution? There is nobody. Aside from a little makeup around the eyes, and a little scream, there is none. Become a young, stupid, arrogant Anakin Skywalker with Darth Vader in one shot. The only consistent thing about Darth Vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, calling him. The only coherent thing Anakin perceives in the prequel trilogy is his constant stupidity. He also loses his body due to a stupid effrontery. <br /> <br /> What part of the Emperor Palpatine who tells him legends of the Sith does not indicate that the Emperor is a Sith? Unacceptable! <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes used too many digital doubles. Everybody is flying everywhere like teddy bears in a fake doll house. Count Dooku, Emperor Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan, almost all the fighters had a double rubbery digital jump. <br /> <br /> In a specific fighting scene, Obi-Wan and Anakin in the climax battle, both have actually stop in the middle of parades and ripostes, turn their sabers a couple of times a few inches away. I realize that the fights are choreographed, but this made me shake my head in disbelief and disgust. <br /> <br /> The writing was horrible. The whole dialogue was of tremendously low quality. Good actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman did the best they could with their jokes, but it wasn't enough. I can't say enough bad things about this movie. Too many special effects, plot holes larger than the center of the universe and absolutely no intuition of any of the characters. This is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. We know the approximate image of everything, all Lucas did was color it. <br /> <br /> We knew that Anakin had lost his limbs. We knew that Luke and Leia were brothers and sisters, we knew that Luke was Anakin's son, we knew that Obi-Wan and Yoda went into exile, we knew everything. Nothing new is offered in this film. If that's all the fans wanted, then it's okay, Lucas couldn't have been wrong. <br /> <br /> But when Anakin finally becomes Darth Vader, and asks Padme, and feels that she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and shouts "Nooooooooooooooooooooo". That scene screamed B-movie all the way, and I almost expected Darth Vader to say "DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER" at any time. This is what it is. A B series film, masked by a huge budget and an ultra-loyal fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two films have pulled their standards to Earth's pits.
