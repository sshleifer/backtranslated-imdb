I had passed this title 15 or 20 times while I was in Blockbuster, looking for something halfway decent to look at. All I can say is that they were all out halfway through the decent movie the night I chose to rent it. <br /> <br /> I will give him credit for being a giant leap better than "Dracula 3000", but in reality it is so easy enough to say since this does NOT have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things that lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, an interesting story, a good dialogue and originality, but I suppose you can't have everything. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS AHEAD *** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of whom was a vampire ... figured) flew around from the mining colony to the mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires he could find. The crew consists of: the arrogant captain, ne'er-do-well (who dies soon), his first and inexperienced first officer, the aforementioned vampire hunter (not a typo), an aspiring cowboy and a really nice and bizarre Asian commando, a "tough" female ... it almost seems like the cast of "The Real World" by MTV. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a crowd of leeches (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of the human anatomy) his first officer takes over ... blah, blah, blah ... everyone hates him .. .blah, blah, blah ... I could go on, but like I said it's the same plot used in about a hundred other "movies" like that. <br /> <br /> The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this film is beyond me. The vampire hunter vampire (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but obviously if you're waiting for her to expose something more than her neckline, look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I can't say it was the worst movie I saw, since I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but I'm waiting for this to come on the science fiction channel.
