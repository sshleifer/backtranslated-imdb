I had a thing for this girl Kari for a while, and regarding her appearance in this movie, no complaints. But after capturing it last night in HIGH DEFINITION, I'm sure: this is the only thing in the film that is not below standards. The script is horrible, the acting is horrible, the direction is horrible. I saw someone else comment on how great the sex scenes were ... what? Not at all. When a movie is so ugly you could even turn it into a soft porn, but instead I see a white, pasty guy that prevents me from seeing the body and the Wuhrer scenes that offer me nothing but a provocation. They should have gone to the cinema so that the film wasn't a complete waste of time, but no. With such a horrible script they should have taken advantage of Wuhrer's appearance, since he is the only professional in the film. 2/10, just because it looked so sexy.
