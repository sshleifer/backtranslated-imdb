The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a campy charm: it opens with the creeping text of the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson plays in his next victims in "Pulp Fiction"), continues with two karate schools teachers from New York they discuss the eternal question of humanity (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?), and then appears Chiba, who plays himself; immediately stops an aerial hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, is soon crushed by the disconnected story, the lack of action for long periods of time and the poor quality of any present action. To simplify, here's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable film to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are almost all the fights. <br /> <br /> 3) The fights that are there are short and terribly filmed. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is beautiful. Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is glorious. It is only to them that I give "The Bodyguard" a second star out of 10. This film does 87 minutes to 5 hours.
