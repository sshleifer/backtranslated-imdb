It really impresses me that it was done. The director / writer / actor must be truly charismatic in reality. I can't think of any other way to pass the script. What I want you to consider is this ... while watching the films I felt sorry for the actors. It was like being in a cabaret where the boy is dying standing and sitting there, not enjoying himself, feeling really bad for him because he didn't try to try. I would really like to know what the budget is, I suppose it should be low since the quality of the film is really poor. I want to write 'I don't like jokes'. but the reality is that they appeal to you, you should be the man who wrote them. or a retard. So imagine it as a script ... and this guy is REALLY bright. What's awesome isn't it?
