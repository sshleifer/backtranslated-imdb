This could be the worst movie ever made, and maybe it's worth seeing just for this reason. Streisand is incredibly incredible as a young woman posing as a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortuous, with Barbara chirping some of the weakest bombers ever filmed. And don't even get me started on the plot. In this film you will get more laughter than many comedies because it is terribly terrible. Streisand's unbridled ego, thinking that she could somehow lift this stinker to the heights of Oscar, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame him. This film is like watching a car crash in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of "The Sound of Music" played backwards on an old record player. It's really that bad. I'm surprised someone from Streisand liked this movie at the level it was intended for.
