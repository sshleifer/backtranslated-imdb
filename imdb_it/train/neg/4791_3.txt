* spoliers * do not read further if you have not seen this movie <br /> <br /> Collecting after the depressing "Phantasm II" ended; The Tall Man kidnaps Mike, while Reggie and new son Tim spend most of the rest of the film trying to bring him back and not end up as a slave on Tall Man's "Red Planet." Pink funeral was there only for the comic relief, and the black karate chick (I don't remember his name) was so irritating that I couldn't wait to see if the High Man had killed his character. This sets him up almost as if he were the character of Tim, who arrives late and is the hero in the end, but ... it doesn't work that way. At the end of this story Liz is beheaded by the killer dwarves, Mike receives a silver sphere implanted in his skull, the balls become Reggie and the dwarves take Tim, and there is no one to stop The Tall Man. - now how is that for a twist in the end? <br /> <br /> This was shot in 1993 and unpublished until 1995, and the end of this was at the final hour, and although it was disappointing and anticlimatic it was also an appropriate and appropriate ending for this strange little series. But the fourth changes this ending and does not add new jokes, but more bad ones, and an even worse and meaningless ending ... <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on ****
