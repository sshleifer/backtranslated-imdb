This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw him at the premiere of SXSW and he was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even told the first one. This is a drama, but people were laughing about how bad the movie was. It is never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as roommates of Livien / bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself too seriously. The absurdity of the Beatles' text was simply absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the film. Unless you're one of those crazy Dominic Monaghan fans, don't worry about that.
