Before I go, I have to admit that I'm a big Bon Jovi fan. In fact this is what attracted me in the case of the DVD in the first place. Probably I would have bought it anyway being a big horror fan and having enjoyed so much of the first Vampire title. <br /> <br /> But it's not as good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it just isn't scary. Apart from the character of Jon, Derek Bliss, none of the other characters makes an impression and you can't care less if they die or not, especially the boring vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire is not simply scary or sexy. Rather, she looks like a 14-year-old anorexic girl, so it's no wonder she's so desperate for blood. Another huge problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or sense of terror. I know that the first Vampires set in New Mexico weren't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepy, but still managed to be obscure and an omen when it had to be. This film has no such tension. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically the same as before. Vampire wants the cross of Berzier to be able to walk in the light of day. However the story has fewer interesting pieces this time. There is no wonder factor in knowing that this is the master of all masters - the original vampire, as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this is. There is no army of masters. Instead it hides in an old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction and then a creepy temple. <br /> <br /> So you really do. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting stories. A real disappointment for me personally.
