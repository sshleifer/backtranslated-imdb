Steven Seagal's films have never been an Oscar material but with each release they get worse and worse. <br /> <br /> This starts with Seagal being picked up by the FBI because it killed some "self defense" people. the active military is thus saved from prison to save a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the clich√© "evil villain English" that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days. <br /> <br /> Suffice it to say that the film has terrible dialogue that is almost always delivered with a massive addition of cheese and the lack of acting talent. The story is not interesting and there are segments that make absolutely no sense and add nothing to the story, characters from the film as a whole as the "lesbian" interaction between the two main women in the cast that is there purely for the title of getting viewers and still not even titillate just confused as it makes no sense on why it happened when it wasn't needed. <br /> <br /> In short, a terrible script with bad dialogues, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and sometimes poorly choreographed action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse. <br /> <br /> Save 98 minutes of your life and give it a miss, even if you're the biggest fan of Seagal.
