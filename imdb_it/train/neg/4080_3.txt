This looks like one of those movies that we think we should like, but I didn't. It seemed to be too difficult to be "artistic". Everything flashes, without content. It has beautiful scenes, and each of them is pleasant to look at, but faces them all together and it becomes a difficult task just to sit down. I rented it because of the brilliant reviews on the cartoon of the video and the fact that I'm a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was very disappointed. I found it a bit pretentious and sometimes boring.
