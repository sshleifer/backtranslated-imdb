It seemed like a good movie, I thought it would be a good movie, and throughout the film I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time, and yes, I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Navale where truly commendable, but despite the best effort this film fails to effectively convey a meaningful message, which seems to have been what Somnath Sen is trying to do. The last point comes short and the ending seems unsatisfactory after all that happens; a bit like real life in this sense, but the films unlike real life end in about 2 hours and the ending should leave the audience satisfied, if indeed this was the intention of the director. This is not up to par, and that's what disappoints me the most. Another aspect that worried me was the national stereotypy of American characters - they all seem to be carved in the same block. It seems to me that most American characters in films in Indian English are based on how the same common Indians perceive Americans as they were and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the film . /> <br /> These two aspects together create a disappointing story.
