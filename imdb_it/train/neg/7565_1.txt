This film is the biggest waste of nine dollars I spent in a very, very long time. If you knew how often I went to the cinema you would probably say, it's hard to imagine, but in any case it's true! After seeing the trailer for this film, I realized I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and suspense, why shouldn't you? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting; unfortunately, the film is none of these. <br /> <br /> From film, to screenplay, to acting, this film is a complete flop. If you are reading this, thinking of going to the movie expecting shudders, mystery, action, horror or anything else that is not a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I'm afraid you're disappointed. <Br /> <br /> "Why is it so ugly?" you might ask yourself. Let me tell you. The film was neither mysterious nor full of suspense. Nothing in the film made me the least bit "nervous", scared or curious. The script was, at best, ridiculous. There have been many times throughout the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous that I started writing it as a comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't. The acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage but this was a lack. Without exception, every performance in this film was incredibly below average. The cinematography was terrible with not a single moment of suspense or mysticism. Finally, the plot is completely transparent. You can see the end of this movie a mile away. <br /> <br /> I am usually not a very strict critic. Frankly, when I go to see a play I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror, I just want to be surprised. This film was boring, misinterpreted, poorly written and an overwhelming disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go see something else.
