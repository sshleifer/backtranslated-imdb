I was crazy when I couldn't see it when it was shown at the Philly Film Fest last year, so when I saw it airing tonight, I put it in memory as soon as I saw it could. So was it worth the wait? Well, let's go back a bit because I haven't given the plot yet. Sean Crawley is a young man who does not know what his path in life is. Enter Duke (George Wendt) who introduces him to his boss Ray (Danny Baldwin). One night Ray was completely hammered and asked Sean to unplug the guy who had followed Sean. And it goes on from there. Which brings me back to the question asked. Was it worth the wait? Yes and no, the accumulation was quite good and George Wendt stole the film for me. He just took the ball and ran with it. But it's not even remotely violent as I've been led to believe and somewhere along the film in real time the ball isn't just falling, but tinkering and taken in the opposite direction. I know exactly where this point happened exactly, but I can't say without ruining the film. But needless to say, it happened. The ending does not even save the film. Poor Stuart Gordon nothing can be as good as "Re-animator" or "Castle Freak". <br /> <br /> My Grade: C <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Extreme <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Kari Wuhrer shows his ta-tas in a fantasy and then in the next other ta-tas and off and ... OH MY GOD MY EYES MY EYES !!!!!
