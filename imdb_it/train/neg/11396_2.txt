The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, finally makes a film that does not come directly to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily everything that came before from Nightmare on Elm Street in the Evil Dead, but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable ... barely. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the plot is very thin and the actors can't get out of a shopping bag. Put it all together and you have a mulch mush for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is very similar. Chewed for 90 minutes and you have a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
