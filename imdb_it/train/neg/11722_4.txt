The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summarized by the opening scene. The CIA wants a dead international terrorist, so contact the killer of Black Ops James Dial. The terrorist is appearing at the Old Bailey court in London asking the question why do they want to clash with a terrorist if he spends the rest of his life in prison? It is going to be out of circulation in both cases. Didn't the CIA have a chance before he was arrested? If by chance he will have an innocent verdict, kill him. There is no logical reason to kill someone who is about to spend their life in a maximum security prison <br /> <br /> Since the premise sets the story, an audience could choose to ignore the hole in the plot, but the assent itself spills over the fire. Dial's colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they are driving in accidents, but Dial manages to escape. So the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far to arrest someone from a car accident? The film of this kind of plot connivance. Dial later finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying "this airport is surrounded by armed bombs", but Dial manages to escape easily without explanation. The whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained. This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day. Why does he help dial Dial even though he is wanted? Your hypothesis is as good as my <br /> <br /> This is a pretty poor thriller and not to be taken by the cast of the "big name". Wesley Snipes used to become a movie star, but he killed his career by playing more and more unusual films. Charles Dance has also appeared in big-budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3, but again he is one of the best known for appearing on DVD directly these days, and he is practically playing a cameo role. Characters of the caliber of Lena Headey can become great actors of the cinema, but surely they will not succeed in putting IL CONTRAENTE in their curriculum
