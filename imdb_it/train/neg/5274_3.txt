If you like movies about gruesome cities, hotels, houses, states (eg "Hotel California") etc. Who own the people who are "simply going through", read a Stephen King novel instead. If you like the "Disappearance" setting, start reading King's "Desperation", but also check "The Shining", "Salem's Lot" and "Needful Things". <br /> <br /> The crow motif, the desert, the family that drives in desperation to escape or avoid possession is tired. Why didn't they just make the film from the novel "Desperation"? Maybe they approached King and he canceled? It must be. <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin seem happy to be reunited and have both worn well over the years, but they are still TV and direct-to-DVD likes.
