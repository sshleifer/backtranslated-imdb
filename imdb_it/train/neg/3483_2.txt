Christmas survived (2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. Downloaded by his girlfriend, a yuppie hotshot does not want to be left alone at Christmas, so he decides to return to his childhood home, imposing on the dysfunctional family that he now lives there and corrupts them to pose like his family. A hateful and one-dimensional performance by Affleck, which acts mainly with a flashy smile, makes his character come off like a mentally deranged, but Gandolfini and O 'Hara breathe some life into this mess. Even for the farce, his stupidity is heavy, it doesn't make much sense from one scene to another, and his sentimental messages are as false as Affleck's smile. 91 minutes, evaluated PG-13. * Â½
