True, there are many films much worse than this movie. This film was not Manos: The Hands of Fate, or Troll 2 (yes, I saw them both .. twice) but at the same time this movie is No Alien, Predator or even Alien vs. Predator (Yes, even that movie surpassed this). Movies like this make Battlefield Earth similar to a Star Wars, it's so ugly. Razzie Awards, your biggest competition has just arrived in theaters. This film I'm talking about is obviously Alone in the Dark. I will try to follow you step by step on why this film was so bad. <br /> <br /> Acting - I will start for the first time with what may have been the best component of this film (alongside the credits, which featured "Wish I Had An Angel", acting, Christian Slater must being proud of himself, he successfully demonstrated that it is possible to act decently in a film worse than drinking antifreeze, to talk, I wondered why he hadn't left the set halfway, perhaps because Stephen Dorff was in the movie (someone who would like to be but can't do it. "actress but good looking and that's all that really matters in films like these. That doesn't mean that the acting was perfect, it was average, not good, and maybe the only one what in the film is not good. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack- With the exception of "Wish I had An Angel", the soundtrack is useless and the heavy medal is pumped into the ears of the spectators, perhaps to unravel the story terrible (something that I will arrive soon) 2 CD long and very expensive sound is now on sale for those who have musical difficulties. <br /> <br /> Directed by the Hollywood director directed by Uwe Ball, who brought us the classic house of the dead. Saying "Yes, movies can get absolutely ugly and this is just the beginning of my deadly saga of terrible films." At least it is said to be directed by Uwe Ball. Without telling me that I imagined that a monkey had been kidnapped from the Congo, brought here and forced to form an opinion on how to make the film under pain of being shocked. The director of photography was probably a camcorder attached to a skateboard and pushed forward to hit a wall. In scenes where the camera should stay still, it moves continuously, not allowing us to stop anywhere and when it should move in action, the camera stops for some reason. <br /> <br /> Is The Producing-Who on earth stupid enough to spend money on this bomb? Too bad for the crazy ... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad he was taught a lesson like that to never put money on junk worse than dog dung tied up in a bag. <br /> <br /> The Writing / Storyboard- Trying to Analyze the story is more painful then jamming an icebreaker under a big toe and kicking a soccer ball as hard as I could with it soon after, but I'll try it anyway. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children go to scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in an electrical socket where he is electrocuted (this is where it became so bad that I started laughing out loud). Then he quickly advanced many years later, where he is a paranoia detective. It is attacked by some zombies that cannot be killed by gunshots, they kill and go on with life. Later he is attacked by a crazy-looking monster and discovers secrets that no one else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is ugly, really bad. The film comes with the expectation of reading about 10 minutes, which looked like 100, of a random text about a false civilization called Abskani. The film must not have one turn after another, more than the public can handle, more than the public wants to handle, more than the public can ever have at heart. This plot is very bad that even Double Dragon does better. <br /> <br /> Overall, you lose this movie. I gave a 1 out of 10, but because there is no 0.
