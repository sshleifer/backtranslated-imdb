I will not devote much time or energy to this comment. I just want to add it because all the comments were so positive that I felt like I just had to let people know that not everyone is so excited, let alone intellectually provoked by this attempt to create a catchy philosophical film enigma. Some scenes looked promising, playing with visual dimensions, but could not stand the rest. I felt as if I had been stoned for the first time again, having semi-philosophical conversations with teenage comrades. <br /> <br /> What a futile attempt to elevate Dutch cinema to new levels. I'd rather see Jesus is een Palestijn, without all pretensions and with direct humor, also raising questions about life and the realities we create for us. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard or Tarkovskij and apparently never will be.
