If Alien, Jurassic Park and the countless other sci-fi movies are your cup of tea, add a bag of sugar and take one. The film begins in ancient old England around 1100ad and then jumps to current California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new head of security and military adviser of a scientific laboratory at 400 feet underground. Arriva (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with the main scientist and we soon discover that it is a cloning laboratory and they have something new found to be cloned. Is it a dinosaur or what? As in previous films, all hell breaks loose and our characters begin to be targeted. The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a "direct to video" movie and Dean Cain does what he is paid for. But forget the rest of the group, because we find out why we have never seen them before. Once again, don't go with great expectations and you'll be alright.
