OK, another film bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK, this is not the worst movie I reviewed this week, but it's still sucked. we had a lot of fun watching this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> The Monster Jigsaw is a mixture of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just know you're in trouble when someone equips you with a circular saw and a shotgun saw, the movie wasn't so bloody as we hoped, I mean death is a heart attack. Even in this case I think that acting sucks, the sum of the actors must be a porn star and one enters his underwear for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is the ending, it leaves it open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2 but this never happened, let it show. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> fun 4/100 mock (how much fun we had to laugh at it) 73/100 acting 8/100 in general 12/100
