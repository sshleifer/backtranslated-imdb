Director Spike Lee is famous for making films emphasizing racism. In many films, "Do The Right Thing", most whites are all brutal racists. In this film, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism that once again is the whole problem. <br /> <br /> What Lee does, however, once again demonstrates his bigotry against Christianity. The double standard that exists in the world of cinema is incredible. If Lee or anyone else had ever produced this kind of prejudice against another group, he would have been denigrated, but Christians? Hey, it's "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoking gun on top of his Bible. They magnify it for another close-up in case they lost it. Hey, folks, here's another Bible reader and see how it is! Lee does this kind of thing in every movie he makes. <br /> <br /> Show the same hatred when it comes to race relationships. Who could argue with the portrait of racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards whites does not help the situation. Add only fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: start "doing the right thing" and leave the prejudices in the closet. Better yet, "surpassing them". <br /> <br /> It's a shame, because the topic could have been a stimulating film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
