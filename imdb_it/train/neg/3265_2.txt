I have no idea which director of the audience George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy of ailments. With Redd Foxx in the central role and with a sufficient number of outfits and polyester to be capped throughout the 1970s, "Norman" sounds like a blaxploitation combined with a number of stupid sitcom episodes that involve comedic misunderstandings, not to mention a elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this story of a married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way their son is secretly gay - and living with a threatening and rampant white homosexual - has enough lameness - he declared shameful jokes for any previous episode of "Three's Company". Bailey retains his dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a few laughs, but the rest of the artists are humiliated. * from ****
