Oh, brother ... after hearing about this ridiculous film for a thousand years all I can think of is the old Peggy Lee song .. <br /> <br /> "Is that all?" ... I was just a teenager when this smoked fish hit the United States. I was too young to enter the theater (although I managed to sneak into "Goodbye Columbus"). Then a screening in a local cinema museum beckoned - I finally got to see this movie, except that I was as old as my parents were when they enjoyed seeing it !! <br /> <br /> The ONLY reason why this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of the time was because of the obscene case triggered by its release in the United States. Millions of people flocked to this stinker, thinking that they would see a sex movie ... Instead, they got many close-ups of gnarled and repulsive Swedes, street interviews in blazons, malls, political assumptions ... and weak who if do not care simulates sex scenes with falling and pale actors. <br /> <br /> Cultural icon, Holy Grail, historical artifact ... whatever it was, destroy, burn and then put the ashes in a lead box! <br /> <br /> The elite extites are still trying to find value in the boring pseudo-revolutionary political thrusts ... but had it not been for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, so forgotten. <br /> <br /> Instead, the rhythmic title of "I Am Blank, Blank" has been repeated endlessly for years as a title for porn movies (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay movies, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc.) and every ten years or so the thing arises from the dead, to be seen by a new generation of windy who want to see that "bad porn movie" that "r evolved the film industry" ... <br /> <br /> Yeesh, avoid like the plague ... Or if you MUST see it - rent the video and fast forward to the "dirty" parts, just to end it. <br /> <br />
