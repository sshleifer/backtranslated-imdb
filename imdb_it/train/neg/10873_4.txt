Many people think this is a good movie but I don't agree with them. At the beginning of the film, a spaceship crashed into the earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship, then killed some people on earth, but for no reason. Besides, it's in a dark forest, I can't see anything on the screen, I can barely hear the sound. <br /> <br /> After a few days, the predator came to earth, but no one had sent him signals before, he should not know what happened on earth, so there is a contradiction. Eventually, the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed him for no reason. He wasn't alive on earth, it's none of his business for what happened here. Finally, the duration of the film is only 90 minutes, the summary is too short and is unable to clearly tell the critics the story. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I don't think this is a good movie.
