My original review of this film was simply the word sh * t written 2000 times. Although this was a very accurate criticism, I felt that my review should be a little more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the lead actress; his facial expression does not change once in this film, it does not show fear, happiness or depression. His abilities in body language have almost come down to glance left and right and he doesn't seem to know Jack. It is an emotionless shell that I imagine has had too much botox. His lack of facial expression throughout the film is however overcome by the deplorable love affair with the leading actor who seems to come out of nowhere and make them do it on a beach and fall in love in a couple of hours of meetings with each other the other. The main actor, whose hair requires more attention than he, was mediocre at best and didn't make me feel like he was genuinely in danger. <br /> <br /> The only thing that exceeds the horrible acting is the direction, plot and inaccuracies in the plot. I've seen swab ads with more structure than this movie. Development is not in the character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe in a real person. <br /> <br /> This movie wouldn't have been bad if it tried to be crappy on purpose like snakes on a plane but it was trying so hard to be a serious action movie that I couldn't even laugh. I think I now have a brain tumor watching this movie and thinking of all the different ways I could have used that budget and the CG team to create something far superior. If I had bought it on DVD, I would have cut the DVD to pieces, burned and then dissolved in hydrochloric acid for good measure. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM!
