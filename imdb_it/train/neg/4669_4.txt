It is interesting to note that a novel without plot has become the basis for two films. While The Heiress was a good adaptation, if not entirely accurate, Washington Square is a heavy and misunderstood hand, except for the part of Dr Sloper, a film that could have been much better. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to create "beautiful" scenes were so obvious that I actually got hurt. It doesn't have the discreet and simple beauty that a film without plot can have, like Onegin. I agree with the other comments on Catherine's portrait of Leigh as an idiot, instead of naive and shy; made me despise that she didn't try for her. <br /> <br /> Catherine's transition from childhood trust to adult cynicism, the whole point of the story, has been internalized, just like in the novel. But we don't have the advantage of a narrative voice to tell us that in a movie! I think someone missed the film school adaptation lesson. I appreciate the director's attempts to create a moving and beautiful film on a difficult text, but it didn't work.
