This film has some of the most beautiful cars I've ever seen in a movie, and certainly the hottest women, but I should say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here is the plot, and if you read it with a little inflection, you also have acting. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, he brings characters to the stage, singing hot woman (obvious lip-synching). The agent or music producer arrives, he thinks it's fantastic, he asks her to run. She turns around, too many bad memories. Flash for the war hero, back from the war, has several fights, and becomes a hero of the cinema with the attitude that he is best of all. Drive in an exotic fast car. Brother runs, then dies. Hero to avenge death, cut to get weapons from friends. (You've never seen this friend before or since, but he really seems to care about him.) Are you sure you want to do it? Yup; I mean are you really sure? Yes, give me weapons; you are REALLY sure; Yup; OK, I guess I can't rule you out, be careful, I love you. <br /> <br /> Now he goes to blow up his uncles who owned the car his brother was driving. He finds a woman, decides to save her, leaves and ends up killing his uncle. Now there will be a race to finish the film. Oh yes, you need to throw another scene with bad people coming in to beat people who don't really count, but maybe add a little storyline. The race isn't even that exciting, obviously it ends with two car races, and one that should win in a surprise ending. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me, because I should have given you the same amount of fun as this movie. Don't get me wrong, the cars are fantastic and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a terrible movie.
