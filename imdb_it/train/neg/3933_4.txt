A huge release success with the Australian public can still be fun today, but its exaggerated political exaggeration and blunt humor can make it a bit irritating. It goes on too long; some of the <br /> <br /> content could have been saved for the sequel, Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, who desperately needed some new things anyway. Sure, his Australian attitude is fun, but it also gets boring when the movie drags on. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best, and they are certainly original, but "hilarious"? The adventures of Barry McKenzie will go down as a benchmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that the public abroad does not see the majority of Australians like Barry McKenzies (or, moreover, Mick Dundees!) . Rating: 5/10
