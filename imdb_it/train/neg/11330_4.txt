"Giant" is one of the most boring and too long Hollywood gadgets ever. Many scenes seem completely false and lacking in energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted on this great Hollywood production. A central notion to this film, that a breeder would ever resist oil drilling on his land, is absurd, and I know it because I'm from Houston. A couple of scenes, especially Dean serving Taylor coffee, redeem this otherwise boring film. For a much more accurate and interesting representation of how modernism changed Texas ranches, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's great performances) or "The Last Picture Show".
