This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. Before coming from Kansas, this film has no truth at all. It's like they got the BTK name and did the rest. Moreover it seems that someone was like having only $ 20 dollars here, take it and make a movie and oh yes don't worry about doing research on btk, just invent something. Seriously pure Dookie, no one should ever see this movie. By slaughtering the scenes of the cows and making his victims eat stuff and describing the slaughter of animals, BTK did none of these things, but the film does it for the love of God who never sees this terrible film. TV products are definitely better and much more precise
