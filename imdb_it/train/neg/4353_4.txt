The Class is a comedy series that portrays a group of 27 former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That's why it saddens me that The Class isn't funny, even though it has the obvious potential. He's not corky enough, just crazy. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and the lack of really hilarious punch lines. Some actors also have difficulty with the times. <br /> <br /> The most invented characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but they too seem a little too square for the sake of the show. On the other hand, the characters I find most disinterested are the main character Ethan and the ex-couple Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothers me is that Aaron's only Latin character is being chosen for his accent (even if from a non-respectable character, but anyway).
