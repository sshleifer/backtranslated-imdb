Wow. Some films leave me speechless. This was undeniably one of those movies. When I left the theater, not a single word came into my mouth. All I had was an incredible desire to bang my head against the theater wall to help me forget the last hour and a half. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Honestly, this film has nothing to recommend. Humor was on the first level, at best, the acting was too silly, and the plot was astronomically far-fetched. I feel committed to never seeing another movie with Chris Kattan or any other SNL cast member.
