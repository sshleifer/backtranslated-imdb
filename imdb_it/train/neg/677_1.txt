I shudder to think about what people must have thought of environmentalists after seeing this piece of bully and preaching movie trash. Larded with enough Indian gambling nuts and buffoonery by his brother to supply a new age shop, Starlight makes anyone who cares about the planet look like an idiot who caresses crystals with feathers. <br /> <br /> The plot? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing the underwear model in a mystical quest to ward off the imminent environmental collapse of the Earth. But first they must defeat an evil alien who doesn't look much like a refugee from a Castro bar. Fortunately, they have the mystic grandfather Willie Nelson to help (which seems vaguely embarrassed by the procedure, as it should be) along with cheap F / X buckets and reams of unnecessarily inflated music. <br /> <br /> Of course, the awkward script helps to obscure the film's trivial plot and impressive pace, but this is just the tip of this melting iceberg. All those interested in this film should be revoked their union cards until the completion of a real course in environmental sciences.
