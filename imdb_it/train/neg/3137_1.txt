I, like many people, saw this film in the theater when it first came out in '97. It was a film below the average at best, not defiantly the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fans love to discover. First of all, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter which way you look at him. People like him because of his appearance. His acting "abilities" consist essentially in saying a lot of mischievous lines and trying to behave in a sexy way. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: the girl falls in love with a boy, the ship is on the sinks, many scenes of lousy love from then on. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize that this is not ingenious at all. Nor is it original. Furthermore, the director felt the need to drag him for more than 3 hours. I could compress it in a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, "Titanic" is the most overrated film to date. Because he has received so much attention and money is beyond me.
