I will not argue with anyone who claims that this film is execrable, as is the January Jones performance, but please check it out, if you haven't already, in the AMC TV series "Mad Men", starting later this month . as is the whole cast. I will acknowledge with charity that he has assumed the role of "taboo" exclusively for money, and, realizing how a putrid disaster would have been, he turned a minimum acting job to avoid hunger. I know if this is the case, but I (now) know for sure that she can act. <br /> <br /> At first, looking at "Taboo", I was convinced that his simple delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about his character or plot. He is not so lucky. Hard to believe that the director didn't suggest at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause trismus. <br /> <br /> Ironically, his winning performance in "Mad Men" comes as a character who, at least in his first appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of himself, and rather colorless, not unlike his role of "taboo". But as the TV series progressed, she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional role as a white mother from the early 1960s. I can't wait to see where he brings his character in the second season. <br /> <br /> To sum up, avoid "Taboo" like leprosy, but surely take a look at "Mad Men".
