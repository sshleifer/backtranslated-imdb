My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race, called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space), shown on the first channel of Russia from 10 to 13 April 2006. An incorrect translation may have ruined some details, but I doubt that it is. The number of real errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first missiles). Even the half of the United States of the film contains more errors and omissions. The public is not informed of any V-2 / A-4 launches from the United States. Three new Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same 'UE' serial number on board. Apollo 1 must be cast on the moon, etc. In the Russian half, each person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is a saboteur and a traitor, Mishin is an alcoholic etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life. Uniform and decorations are horrible. Gagarin sings a frivolous song awaiting launch (I think it was added specifically for the Russian version).
