.... CAUSE IT'S A MORTGAGE! The kind of movie that makes you want to go hit the filmmaker and say "WHY?" Horrible photographic work ... count the times when the camera tries to stay still on a person and cannot. Dialogue is ridiculous. The acting is comic. They seem to have conquered a ghost town to the west to see if they could make a film with the least amount of money possible. I would bet $ 10 they used home video cameras to do this. Or that, or most of the cameramen were drunk. Truly the trailers are more fun than the movie. If you want to host a "worst movie festival", bring this. Want more entertainment ... fix a wall.
