This film is a clear attempt by the Hollywood left to portray the administration of Reagan as incompetent and botched. Some errors may have been made at the time of the crisis, but I'm sure they are not interpreted in this lame film in this way. My first reaction was that this film had to be directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I was wrong. There are apparently many others.
