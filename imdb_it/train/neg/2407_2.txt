I saw it today, partly attracted by the cast of all the stars and partly because I enjoyed so many other films of this genre. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of poorly cut scenes where the continuity doesn't flow, the billiard challenge at the beginning, for example. The fighting scenes with the natives are about the same as those you would remember in those old black and white Tarzan movies, you know where you see a spear flying through the air and the camera cuts to a dead native who lies motionless on the floor with what comes out of his thigh. Is that instant death? There are also many completely useless scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, like the little girl being saved while picking flowers. Really badly animated clay toys are too painful to watch. If you see this film the crabs that advance about 5 km / h are the strong point. Somehow you manage to sneak on David Mccullum and pinch him. It is as if there was no time to get out of the way, like when the obelisk in the city falls, the native has all the time in the world to take a 2 step to the left, but he does not scream and falls on him. I only give a 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullums' voice develop a stutter while the movie progresses?
