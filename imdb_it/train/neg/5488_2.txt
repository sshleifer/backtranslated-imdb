Why on earth is Colin Firth in this useless film? Was he really so short of money? <br /> <br /> Is the film not clear on what it wants to be, pain?, exotic places?, ghosts?, a vehicle for Mr Darcy? It's a messy and muddy mess. There seems to be some sort of idea that Italy should be good in itself, and that Italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls only want to go back to Yankland. <br /> <br /> There are useless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what is it, or why would anyone care just isn't clear. /> <br /> There was also a slim woman in the film. It was not clear what the job was here, but he seemed to be there only to make vile, inappropriate and mushy comments to the girl. Should it be on paedophillia ?? <br /> <br /> A rather terrible mess, all in all. I gave 2 instead of 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an absolutely horrible movie.
