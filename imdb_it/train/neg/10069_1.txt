This is a horrible movie. Yes, the girls are nice but they are not very good. The plot of a cowboy involved in an Indian girl would be interesting if sex was not in the way. Well, okay it might be interesting, but it's not, because it's so rude and only partly acted. I can only imagine how the close-ups of ballads on a big screen were made, probably more laughable than they do on TV. (I won't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and they pass the whole thing from the chest to the chest. I never read it in the old west) This is a film that requires liberal use of progress fast. /> <br /> I like Schlock movies, but this is ridiculous. There is a reason why I don't go for this type of film and that I'm not very good, the plot takes a back seat compared to the breast. The original nudie cuties as they were called were originally nudist films or films in which they did not touch, but while the adult industry was starting to grow filmmakers were trying to be smart or trying to exploit something else to put the seats on the seats. There were very few clever ones who left only hacks that were of limited talent. Comedies often went better with humor approaching the first level, childlike but harmless. Something that rarely can be said of any other kind dresses like a nudie. <br /> <br /> The Ramrodder looks good and has a couple of beautiful pieces but is made without being either westerns or porn movies. > <br /> I don't need to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Probably interesting to anyone, the rapist and the killer in the film was played by Bobby Beausoleil, a member of the Manson family who was arrested for killing a teacher not long after the shoot. <br /> <br /> Obviously this kind of thing will ruin some people's lives.
