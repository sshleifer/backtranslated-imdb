As a former Kalamazoo resident with a passion for the city, I couldn't wait to see this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the values ​​of acting and production are not bad, the script is horrible, the plot is not realistic and the theme is disturbing. <br /> <br /> The main message of this film is that women are nothing without husbands and children. I can't believe how regressive I am in women's vision. Did the writer live under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment for the city from which it takes its name.
