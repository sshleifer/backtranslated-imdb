<br /> <br /> This film (not a movie - clearly recorded on an inexpensive cam-corder) could be one of the biggest stinking movie bombs in history. Attention: the package advertises the film as an erotic exploration of sex addiction. The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no longer erotic than staring at one's own warts. The script is useless and tortuous, with all the elements of the plot serving as a segway between alleged sex scenes. However, even the sex scenes are limping. Except for the first one, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically upset. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you don't want it. If you're looking for a movie to tickle sex, you don't want it. Whatever the goals, desires or perspectives of your life, you don't want to watch this movie. As they did to Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski and Ed Begly to act in this stink bomb is staggering to the extreme.
