"Scary Movie 2" is a disappointment for the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this was rather boring and not much fun. Fortunately, after this film they took their part and made two more science fiction films. <br /> <br /> This film is about a group of teenagers being tricked by their professor to go to a haunted house for a night. Things start to get wrong and then realize that they have to flee. <br /> <br /> This movie is not horrible, but could have improved a lot of things. It's a little fun and if you like the other Scary Movie series movies then have a look at this watch, but I don't think you'll like it that much.
