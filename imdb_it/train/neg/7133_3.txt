I felt like I was watching Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a slightly different storyline. I will say that the cars in the film are very beautiful. So if you like fast cars, you will probably find this film pleasantly fun. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from Days of our Lives. She's a really good singer, but it's a shame that they gave her such horrible songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs on machines; not exactly what you'd like here on the radio. Since this is a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little subtitle, but in real life I don't think an average joe came across a girl as sexy as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a racing car, repair a motor car, and be a solo singer. It's all very silly. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone wishing to wager 25 million on a car race is a fool. But in the end it was fantastic, when Natasha stops right before the finish line and takes out Michael. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: This film is for car enthusiasts. So, if you like fast cars, then I would recommend this.
