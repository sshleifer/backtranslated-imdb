By far the most important requirement for any film that follows trust cheaters is that they must, at least occasionally, be able to drag one onto us, as well as their stupid votes, the cops, the mobs and (ideally) the one another. But this film NEVER pulls it. Each cheat can be seen a mile away (especially the biggen!) Nor are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Maybe Mammet hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogues and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are fine, but they are pronounced in such a stylized, unnatural and stylized way that I thought maybe you were making a smart point about us playing all the time ... but it wasn't. As far as psychological complexity is concerned, the main character is a little repressed and makes Freudian ridiculously forced into his father, thinking she is a whore, but she manages to get past him. However I really liked the street scenes. It looked like a painting by Edward Hopper.
