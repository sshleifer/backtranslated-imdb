I bought this DVD because it contains kari and the mpaa charts said; "R rating for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> that correctly, IMO, should declare; "R rating for violent violence, sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> the word "sexuality" should come after a "comma", not an "e" because of the enormous difference in meaning it has. I think many people who have seen this movie will agree with me that sexuality and nudity are almost non-existent. my first impression when I look at mpaa's evaluation is that I will look at something like a "vivid" movie. this is why I felt cheated. as for the plot, it was so-so, after all who really cares about the story if there was the gorgeous kari. I know I don't know. <br /> <br /> obviously, this is just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
