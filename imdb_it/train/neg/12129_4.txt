Before this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the scruffy zombie film Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous among horror fans for his unforgettable performance by Peter Bark, man-child, and the very nice yellow Strip Nude For your killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were funny in their own way (and the fact that they presented a lot of blood and nudity didn't hurt). The massacre, however, is boring, boring, boring, despite some splatter and the odd point of free naked meat. <br /> <br /> The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and troupe of a horror movie are residing during the filming, is confusing and really boring: when the blood doesn't flow and the leather is not on display, the film is a real struggle to overcome (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikely characters fighting each other and doing very little note. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest in the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, has used many of his death scenes to fill his mega-movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert) . And if you've seen that movie before, then there's little reason to worry about Massacre.
