The script for "Scary Movie 2" was not yet ready. This is a problem with the film that is clearly evident, both for the actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many of the actors are funny people; and therefore the film is not completely devoid of a sense of humor. To their credit, the film has several funny moments. But overall, "Scary Movie 2" isn't even close to being as smart and fun as the original. <br /> <br /> The first "Scary Movie" was a laugh at the minute. He turned the smallest subtleties of the genre into the slasher movie into comic gold. The humor of "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy as it is not original. There are also obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movie stars are former cast members of "Beverly Hills 90210", and this was a show that demanded to be parodied! Ultimately, "Scary Movie 2" is like a nice bottle of wine that has been opened too soon. The script needed much more time to grow old. 2 stars out of 5.
