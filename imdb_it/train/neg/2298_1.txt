Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons who confidently stated "a decent track record" on forecasts <br /> <br /> in his comments widely circulated from the January 2 edition of The 700 Club of the Christian Broadcasting Network, during which predicted that there would be "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass killings" in the US in the "second half" of 2007; But a review of Robertson's predictions for the new year 2006 undermines the request. He predicted, for example, that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will strengthen". WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The autumn elections will be inconclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in office". WRONG <br /> <br /> * "The war in Iraq will come to a positive conclusion: we will begin to withdraw troops before the end of this year". WAY WRONG <br /> <br /> Furthermore, as reported by an Associated Press article on January 3rd, Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions: <br /> <br /> The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would have easily won re-election. Bush won 51 percent of the vote, beating Democratic Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would win after his second term. He said the social security reform proposals would be approved STILL WRONG! <br /> <br /> Supports to speak directly with God ... If so, the god has a sense of humor that looks at Pat who makes fun of himself again and again ..
