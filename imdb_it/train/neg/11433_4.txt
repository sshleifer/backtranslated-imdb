The first half of this film is pure delight. Novel. Funny. Wonderful shows. A narrow brother and sister living in Manhattan fall in love with the same woman! Adult. Bright. Humorous. What more could you ask for. As a romantic comedy this starts refreshing. He heads for uncharted territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> Switch from being a universal adult comedy to a coming-of-the-clos-out-of-the-closet story that has been done many times before. What a disappointment. Like a movie of people it starts with that promise. Because he needs to turn into a movie "I am who I am". The final freeze-frame shot by Heather Graham blowing up to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself" underlines the banality of the last part of the film. <br /> <br /> It may have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up being the same old old man.
