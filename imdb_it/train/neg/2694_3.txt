warning: contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene, then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This confirms the above word. The second scene is the center of rotation of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the film boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this is made more frustrated. To compensate for the resulting lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced the characters are. And oh yes, they have a lot to show. Andy (P. Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more ?, he is cheating his wife, more ?, he intends to rob his father, more? do you regret his complicity for his mother's death, more ?, he is a serial killer, more? etc. etc. there is not enough space to write here ... I wonder how he could have a great job. And because his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand, I really like actor Hoffman's performances. <br /> <br /> Even here PSH saves what remains from my $ 7 spent on this nonsense. Why the absurdity? Why doesn't it make sense, why should I take care of the despicable characters? Another broken headword is that a film should have a nice (at least pleasant) character. <br /> <br /> Furthermore there is a lot of sentimentality, for example we should deal with the suffering of the widowed father without knowing anything about the lives of the parents before the crime.
