This film seems to be a rip off of many films that have covered the same topic in the past. Make the future viewer realize that "Art Heist" adds nothing to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the film. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin continues to reappear in the films and, frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or that directors and producers love his unusual looks stupid, complimented by that strange hairstyle that he sports in most of his films. The only good movie in which he appeared is "The Squid and the Whale", in which he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his protagonist, does not get much better; there is no chemistry between Mrs Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A film to be seen at the risk of the viewer.
