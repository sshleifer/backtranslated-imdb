I can't believe this film was made recently in 1984. It has a laughable acting, not to mention one of the most stupid plots ever. Who would ask the fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian who was illegally arrested in Mexico to Italy? Not to mention the fact that the film's title doesn't tell you practically anything - in fact, it's a generic title for an action / crime film that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I only saw him on MST3K with Mike and the robots as a shield. They examine the similarity of the female protagonist with Elaine of Seinfeld ("None of them is spongy") and the non-stop riff on Baker's weight. This film is probably not worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation surely precedes him here: when his title appears at the beginning of the film, Tom says: "I would like to be illiterate, so I shouldn't have read it".
