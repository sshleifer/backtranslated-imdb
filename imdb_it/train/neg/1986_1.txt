Must agree with the other reviewer. This must be the worst movie, not to mention the western I've ever seen. A terrible acting, a dialogue that was devoid of imagination and pathetic (not to mention totally inappropriate for allegedly being in 1800), and oh, did I mention a battery clearly displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the boom microphone to fall in the middle of a scene. And the ending? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the film ... completely awful. And yes, it contained all the clich√©s in the book from the slow walk along the dusty empty street to the "remember when" laughter when a main character dies. Luckily I saw it on TV for free. Do not waste time.
