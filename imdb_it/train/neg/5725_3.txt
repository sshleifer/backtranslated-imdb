2005 gave us the hostel of the movie "gore porn" and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a non-decent rip-off of Hostel. Live Feed follows more or less the same formula as Eli Roth's previous film, except that this time stupid children are in Asia rather than Central Europe. The plot focuses on these stupid kids, and one of them bothered one of the locals, so they got into trouble. The locals decide to block them all in a theater and kill them. Although I had listened to some less favorable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped it could at least be quite decent because director Ryan Nicholson had already made the wonderful 45 minute rape and revenge film "Torched", but this film simply falls because most of it is ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to bring back to the good old days of the Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did, successfully), but it doesn't really come out. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work on special effects, even the blood is not impressive ... even though it is much better than acting! There is not much more to say about this film ... it is bad and not in a positive sense. Avoid it!
