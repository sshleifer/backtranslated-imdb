... but the problem with this production is that it is very far from a good musical. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can't always expect witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber witty. He is deadly boring and non-inventive (with one or two exceptions) and immediately after seeing him I could not remember a single significant melody - which is rather tragic to come from someone who has learned the whole Three Hundred People audience. <br /> <br /> It is strangely not theatrical. It takes place on an incredibly large stage (one must really feel sorry for those people in the front row who have broken their necks to see something that happens 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left) and does absolutely nothing with it. When there should be someone who sings on stage, that's just what you get - and the rest of the huge stage is empty. For me, aspiring theater director was almost painful to watch. <br /> <br /> The fact remains, Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these non-talents can ever bring. And I'm puzzled by the popularity of this unmissable musical.
