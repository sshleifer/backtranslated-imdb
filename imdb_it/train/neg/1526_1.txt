I could have seen movies worse than this, but if I had, I don't remember. Or maybe he blocked them. Who knows, if I were to undergo hypnotherapy, I could remember them, perhaps, with abortions of alien children or other traumas. If so, I will happily exchange those memories for those I have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I should give some credit to the film: it has produced an emotional response. Actually I started to get angry with scenes that falsified other movies and TV shows, that this parody was getting them dirty by association. I'm terrified that I might not be able to watch movies like Dr Strangelove without this movie going through my mind.
