This started badly, got worse and when the girl attacked the old lady I finally wanted to bring the DVD to the person who borrowed it and choke the C ** T with death. Avoiding this movie, some good cinematography and some naked shots, would be almost acceptable if I were 14 and hadn't seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If anyone feels the need to watch this movie, I strongly recommend that you spend your time more appropriately, for example I would say that trying to cram a Lego house in your ass without lubricant would be a good start. I heard that this film was not the original version, I would love to see the original, since it seems that this cut version is devoid of any plot, and apparently most of the nudity, can anyone tell me how I can get in touch with Christian Viel , owes me an hour of my life!
