I wanted to like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories coming together but Magnolia took a wrong turn in the middle of the film and I was lost. I almost turned it off immediately, but I felt I should stay there until the end, I knew it would be another tortuous 1 hour and a half. Thank God I rented instead of seeing him in the theater. I almost screamed in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the final scene of the frog. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't blame it a bit. It was a unique film, but a bad film, boring and useless.
