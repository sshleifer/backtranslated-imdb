... luckily he hasn't done it yet! This is a crude and simplistic student policy, transformed into a drama. He needs the viewer to buy into a series of presumptuous reports. Concept 1: that a British electorate could be moved from being basically in the center-right to being overwhelmingly on the far left. Conceit 2: The whole debate in the media and the general public is unanimously closed and the only critics of the new Prime Minister are the sinister public officials, MI5, big business and the Americans (of course). Conception 3: That this radical socialist can solve all trade union, economic and social problems with extreme ease in a way that unites the nation. Conception 4: that cutting all ties with the United States and NATO is a good thing. Conception 5: that the Soviet Union is not a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them in the 1980s. And finally, Conceit 6: That the reactionary forces of the United States would actively seek to launch a coup against Great Britain. <br /> <br /> It is ridiculous and the show has only earned the reputation it has felt trying to cash in some anti-Thatcher feelings in the country and having left winged TV critics sing its praises. When it was realized, television was still a very popular and influential medium, with shows that got huge appraisals, so a much discussed controversy with a bit of controversy had a good chance of getting a large audience. Ray McInally's performances have been fantastic, which is one of the few extra points. History and time have shown the enormous weakness in the premise and in the plot of this show.
