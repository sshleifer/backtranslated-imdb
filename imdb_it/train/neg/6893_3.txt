I had high hopes for this film. The theater monologue is fantastic and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting man, with a lot of experience and knowledge when it comes to movies. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian films, but this film is bad. It is absolutely amazing that 34-year-old actors are suddenly playing the roles of teenagers. The "language games" were horrible and exaggerated. Nothing in the film seemed real to me. The ending was too deus ex machina for me. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed and I think I wasted an hour and a half of my life.
