The idea is to make something interesting happen in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer. When we get to a point, it's so monumental that I kept thinking I misunderstood it. But I didn't. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an owner of Osaka who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time who worked on different shifts and therefore didn't realize they were sharing. His friend asks "But what about the weekends?" Sean does not have an adequate explanation. Sean tells the story of his own problem, which is that he's not sure his girlfriend is still living at home while working during the night and working during the day so they never see each other. This went on for three weeks. But his friend doesn't ask, "Yes, but as I said before, what about the weekends? You have to see it then. It doesn't make sense." What are you talking about, Sean? ? "But we are generous and suppose that they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean check if soap and towels have been used. (Indeed, bizarrely, he starts taking the soap with him.) what about the balm and shampoo of his girlfriend, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Missing? Has anyone been bought? "No? His clothes are used and exchanged for clean ones? Is the laundry basket full? In the bathroom, is the seat raised or lowered? I mean, good pain! <br /> <br /> And to close everything, Paul decides to quit his job early to see if his girlfriend still lives at home. Why not just call her? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse In the last act though no one told Vincent where the rest is going of the group, he manages to find them, Lenny's love interest and Sean semb's girlfriend They can be the best friends and they can even find the group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain these extraordinarily unlikely coincidences. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the dialogue is OK but not good enough to compensate for the weak characters or the boring boring story. <br /> <br /> I heard one of the actors interviewed and promised "no guns, no drugs, no corsets". I thought, "fantastic". But after half an hour of boredom I was screaming at the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> It would not have taken long to solve these problems but on the official website the director boasts that the film was not written from a script. It's all you need to know.
