I know the plot of Alice, who survived the previous episode of the Nightmare series, finds the mortal dreams of Freddy Krueger that starts again. This time, the provocative killer strikes the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to "be reborn" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her child? This movie started really well while we see Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger who gets stuck in the room and is raped by 100 Manics, then she is hospitalized but then she is no longer the pregnant woman but then Amanda who gives life to Freddy again . <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people to come back from the 4th movie and then they received some new friends, not long before Freddy starts killing again, I liked the first death, okay, not good like the other dead or dreams. <br /> <br /> Freddy himself didn't look scary in this movie at all, the nightmare was just boring, in reality they weren't scary or scary at all. /> <br /> Acting movies was ok for a fifth film in the series, but overall I think this movie was really boring. (Still not the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
