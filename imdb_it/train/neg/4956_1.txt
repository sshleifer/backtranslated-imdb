When this cartoon was broadcast for the first time, I got the impression that it would be at least halfway down, boy was I wrong. I have to admit that watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I saw some episodes and two of them literally had Batman beat right and left by the penguin who fought as Jet Li and beat Batman and saw another episode in which Batman kicked his ass from the Joker, who apparently he was using the moves of Jackie Chan as he launched into the air like a ninja. Since when had the Joker or Penguin ever been a match for Batman? and worse when there were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the image of Batman is depicted in this show. The entertainment is terrible and the dialogue is terrible. Being a fan of Batman since my adolescence, I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs, because it does not project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like an aspiring Kung Fu Flick and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon I highly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing but a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.
