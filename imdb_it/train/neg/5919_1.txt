I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little Laura Ingalls for being involved in something so little realized. I'm not sure it was a horrible writing or a bad direction or both, but it leaves a spectator very disappointed in wasting time looking at this ugly one. It consisted of a naive narrative line, very poor lines, and relied solely on pretty landscapes and nice people who sold it. Unfortunately this was not enough. You'd better rent a tape full of static rather than waste your time with this shit. Lindsey Wagner also played a rather pathetic role as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard without doing anything, anyone who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world.
