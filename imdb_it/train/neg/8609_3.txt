If you've seen previous films and Rodney Dangerfield performances, you'll recognize many of the jokes made in this strange piece of dreck. Written as a sitcom, this film fails to hit any kind of agreeable arrangement in everything, from the self-help doctor played by the sexy liver to pieces, Molly Shannon, to "I'm fat, and therefore amusing" John Linette. The 5 wives are pretty nice and, if he had been made as a pilot for a series of adventures and actions, he could have worked. Instead, it presents itself as a male fantasy that strives not to be politically incorrect.
