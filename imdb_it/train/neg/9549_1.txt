I wondered why John Wood was not playing Dr. Falken until I watched the film. Plot BAD, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad movie. Please don't watch this movie. Rent the original "War Games" if you feel nostalgic. <br /> <br /> I didn't even like the idea of ​​bending the plot to beat the terrorist. In the first film, W.O.P.R was built because Russia had thousands of newspapers aimed at the United States. In this film the idea behind the computer was to kill terrorists during training before they became a threat. Politics aside, one of the positive things about the first film was the highlight that even a stupid computer could grasp the idea of ​​the uselessness of war in the end. No such view is offered in this film.
