This is really a weird movie ... First, we have a former US gymnast trying to transform the actor (or something), and this seems to be the only role I've ever had (that I know anyway) - and for good reason While playing the role well enough to maintain some interest, it's a rather bland and flat performance. Second, we have the worst sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the film extremely comical, but in that annoying way. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally acceptable acting cast (including the necessary hot chick!), a story not really that bad, and some interesting pictures; dialogue, combat scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and general execution of the plot are weak. This film would have been barely better as a network TV movie (too ugly Fox was not present in 1985). It is one of those films that is simply ugly, but you can't resist looking and even enjoying yourself when you get used to it, especially now that you have found the perfect eternal home late at night TV and cable.
