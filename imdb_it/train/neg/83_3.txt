Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive and likeable woman, overwhelmed by a teenage daughter with an intelligent mouth, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a petty husband, Sean (Rick Roberts), both of whom were boringly selfish and hateful . <br /> <br /> This was advertised as a family in difficulty pursued by a mad assassin during a relentless storm. <br /> <br /> The storm does not occur even until the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it is nothing to send someone running into the storm cellar. <br /> <br /> Stalking, in the same way, does not become intense until almost the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Much of the film we pass by listening to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, argue until I just wanted to slap her daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she took up with Zack, a questionable guy, and they do it constantly - in fact Jill comes home to find them in Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we pass listening to Jill's husband, Sean, or complain about Jill or criticize her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all attractive, since his face is so covered with freckles that you could play to connect the dots. <br /> <The story begins with notifying Jill of a pending account on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and who thought Sean had never been to anyone. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where he meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, old, divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he sees her husband again, he calls Jill and gives her in order. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is angry, lets Sean go without seeing her and does absolutely nothing. In fact, he doesn't say anything to Sean when he gets home. This made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill gave Richard his business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in the real estate business. She shows him an apartment. Then they drink something and things become more welcoming to each other. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill are doing it, hot and heavy. In fact, he looks a little more aggressive than necessary, when Jill suddenly decides to cut out. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his scam. Sean complains about how Jill has disappointed him since his father died. Apparently his lack of any moral is all his fault. In the end, Jill confesses his lack of morale and adultery towards Sean - and of course this too is his fault as far as Sean is concerned. <br /> <br /> The small family decides to go camping - this means more whining and grumbling among themselves, especially from the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was cheering for the stalker to get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
