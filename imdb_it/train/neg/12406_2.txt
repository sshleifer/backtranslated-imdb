The Treasure Island DVD should be required for viewing on any film production course! It is a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the film and then listening to the writer / director's comment graphically shows the huge gap between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to the public about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the public doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's stated purpose is to make the film devoid of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, there is consistency of character and conceptual clarity. The director himself realizes that the public often does not understand the points in which he deliberately avoided a "cliché of Hollywood". However, it never seems to capture the idea that clichés exist for a reason. They are a shortcut for transmitting complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they must be replaced with another way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, full of potential. Two puppets are in charge of fabricating a personality and a background for an unidentified corpse that must be used in a disinformation mission in the last days of World War II. Soon everyone starts to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes more and more real for them. Someone with less contempt for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This movie certainly isn't! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are too often defeated by the confused and confused script. In particular, I am increasingly struck by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
