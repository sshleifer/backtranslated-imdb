This film is essentially about Dr. Claw, the archenemy of Inspector Gadget, who returned after many years to the city of Metropolis, now peaceful. Claw's plan is to foil Gadget once and for all using a new "colder" criminal to help destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived almost 20 years later with tragic results. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, he does not do it anymore; Dr. Claw is not only visually less frightening, but sounds more like a wrestler with a cold than his original intimidating self. Sure, it's a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (I can't name the animation), which pales in comparison to the original series. Someone decided to update Penny and carry on her twenties, now has a quasi-punk rebel clothing style and doesn't play the role she had in the TV series. The Gadgetmobile speaks, as well as including a plot angle that concentrates the entire talking machine. Maybe I'm just a guy who loved the show that grew tired, but I thought the live-action version was more painful than I could bear, but now this complete series of quality TV series we go on and come out. It's more than I can bear.
