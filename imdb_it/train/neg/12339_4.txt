This comedy has some pretty tolerant things, surrounded by a lot of little fun things. Almost every scene involving castle servants and their stupid antics is a waste of time. And the plot is so sloppy that I ask if they were actually ready for the script before they started filming, or were simply doing everything as they went along. (* 1/2)
