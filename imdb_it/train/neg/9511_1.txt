I wanted to see this movie since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see him last night at 7:40. I'm sorry the day I lost my ticket on this garbage when I could see something better. The beginning was all a bunch of garbage and clich√©s. They have exaggerated the way love works in reality. All the girls were stereo type. The boy was too stupid for his own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl barely endured. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that were used in other films. Their escape car was an old damn Chevy who claimed he had no breaks. Hey, why didn't they get a nice girl robbery instead? He may have raised the public's view of the film. This film was very low, low, low, low, low, because nothing was damaged or destroyed. This film contained many things that would have made Christians crazy. Hey, I was even expecting a car chase scene, because all the bank robbery movies have car chases, but there was never any. So I consider this film b which means cheap budget and 1 in ten stars.
