A typical Goth girl (Rainbow Harvest looks like a cross between Winona Ryder in Beetlejuice and Boy George) gets involved even with people who think she's wrong with the help of an old haunted mirror that finds her and her mother in the new house backbone, Karen Black, the only thing far from this disguise) buys. The acting is rather ridiculous (especially when Rainbow interacts with the mirror above) and there is neither fear nor suspense. This film is inexplicably generated for 3 sequels, each slightly more atrocious than the last. People looking for a similarly but dramatically themed cinematic endeavor would be well advised to look for the episode of "Friday 13: the series" in which a geeky girl finds an old damn mirror. This results in a more intense 40-minute thrill than the entire franchise has provided in all 4 of his films. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Charlie Spradling provides the mandatory T&A
