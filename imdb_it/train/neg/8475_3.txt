(NOTE: I thought I would be the only one writing what I did below, but I see the others here agree. I guess it was pretty obvious - this was exaggerated with the bit bait-the-cat. He had written :) <br /> <br /> The owners went on vacation for two weeks - a trip to California - leaving the cat (Sylvester) all alone and locked up at home. That means no milk, but the cat, to his great relief, finds some canned tuna. However, to his dismay, he cannot find the opening. <br /> <br /> It turns out that the little mouse in the house has it ... and the cat comes out with it. This is a bad rodent who continues to tease Sylvester with the opening and then pulls him away at the last second. Sylvester looks for everything he can to open the tuna can but he can't. <br /> <br /> This is a frustrating story, and because they make the sadistic mouse the "good guy" is beyond me. It's like some of Tom & Jerry's cartoons where poor Tom always gets the worst, even though the mouse often starts the conflict!
