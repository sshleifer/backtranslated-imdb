Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nickname that the romantic protagonist of Donna Reeds played by Tom Drake labeled with her! Then clarify it immediately. From her first role in The GET-AWAY (1941) her latest DALLAS (1984-1985), Mrs Reed, can NEVER be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slim actress. His roles in M.G.M. He rarely experienced his talents. <br /> <br /> Ms. Reed is supported by a cast of actors with competent characters, who unfortunately have to go through this alleged "ball screw" comedy. Clearly M.G.M. he was out of their depth making this kind of film. A best product type at COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the "touch" of Ernst Lubitsch nor the ingenuity of Preston Sturges could save this film. A rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the signs of a prewar effort (WWII). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg were still alive, the script would have undergone a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. It adapted to the "safe zone" of Louis B. Mayer of no stimulating family entertainment. A form that could not stand the post-war challenges of the "DeHavilland Decision", the loss of their theatrical chains, television and would contribute to the decline of M.G.M. Fortunately for Donna Reed her best days are in front of her, culminating in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.
