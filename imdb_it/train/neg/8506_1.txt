This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. Inconsistent would be a compliment. Even the end made no sense, but it was a huge relief that it was finally over. I looked at it with a sort of fatalistic charm to see if it could continue to deteriorate and so it was. At the end of this mess I was sorry that none of the characters had survived and I didn't feel too charitable towards the actors. If you want to see a train accident, I suggest you go to a train station. Even waiting on an abandoned train platform beats this mess. Apparently I didn't vent enough to fill my ten prescribed lines, so, at the risk of redundancy, I'll say it again. This film is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?
