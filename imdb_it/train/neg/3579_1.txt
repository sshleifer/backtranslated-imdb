Immediately after renting and watching this film several years ago, a friend of mine and I decided to define the absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing in the film that could have been made worse than it was. Even today we evaluate films, even very bad ones, than they are better than "The Lonely Lady". <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenplays for, among other things, "Last Summer" and "Diary of a Mad Housewife", and says she is was asked to write a screenplay for Harold Robbins' book "The Lonely Lady". He said he sent a treatment and was rejected because they didn't think they understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then he said "I think they have someone else write it." The interview was filmed before the film was released. He died in 1981, and I bet that the first thing he did when he arrived in heaven was to personally thank God for saving her from being involved in the result.
