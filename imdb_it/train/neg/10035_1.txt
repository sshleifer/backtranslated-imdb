Absolutely awful movie. Absolutely useless. <br /> <br /> the background music is so loud that you can't understand the word. Well, if you listen closely, whatever you talk about is actually incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> Camera work is bad, editing is not present, background score gives headaches, action is poor, dialogs are incomprehensible, Acting is abysmal and well Kareena looked like wrestler, now he looks like a hungry wrestler. Hell you can lose weight but you can't get grace. <br /> <br /> After spending three hours watching a movie, I would like to, but this film would not even allow me that pleasure. <br /> <br /> Please, if you want to torture yourself, go ahead and watch this.
