I went to see D-War on a whim and with very low expectations. The film failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I don't mind stories that extend credulity - remember Reign of Fire? - but I expect them to be internally consistent. This film jumped from screaming to howling without stopping to breathe, all interspersed with special effects that have lagged far behind LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A mystical warrior from Korea changing, transformed into a strange metamorphosis A Caucasian antiquarian and popping up as a deus ex machina to bring out the unfortunate protagonists from their last mess. A special FBI agent who seems to be completely boned on ancient Korean folklore due to the excellent "paranormal division" of the FED - which so far has remained unnoticed. Lovers who kiss on deserted beaches where one exclaims "I never wanted this to happen". A couple of dead and reincarnated Koreans who "died as crossed lovers". Mystical pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (who owe a lot to the orcs of Peter Jackson) and a snake that loses so much time roaring that whenever the chosen prey is at hand something arrives to distract it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrifying, the acting in wood and the effect of everything have been, to be honest, boring. However, for me the crowning was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the credits was - Arirang! This is rather like Akira Kurosawa who closes "Ran" with a karaoke version of My Way - and I'd like to be clear that I'm not at all comparing director Shim with Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> In short, a self-indulgent, lackluster collection of narrative clich√©s and non-sequences that can attract the sense of melodrama so prevalent in Koranic popular culture, but should not be worth the ticket price for any enthusiast of serious films - or even a not so serious film-goer. I would suggest bypassing the cinemas completely and going directly to the video, but I'm not even sure it's worth that much.
