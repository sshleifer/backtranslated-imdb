After the discreet success of MASTI which was slightly better Inder Kumar is back again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood movie SEE NO EVIL, DON'T LISTEN TO EVIL <br /> <br /> The film reminds you of HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) where Kader and Anupam play the blind and the deaf <br /> <br /> This movie is a boring exercise <br /> <br /> The film has such nonsense jokes that you don't want to laugh like Snehal Dabi's head get stuck in the back of the horse and all those comedies of a kind we don't laugh now but end <br /> <br /> The film starts in a clich√© way and some scenes are fun, unfortunately these moments don't last for a long time because history never moves in this half, even comedy becomes boring. The turning point is well managed and the second half becomes an action movie in which the blind and the deaf go to save the heroines and we have all the OTT hunting scenes and fighting scenes <br /> <br /> The direction of Inder Kumar is bad Music is okay, a song stands out I LOVE YOU MY ANGEL <br /> <br /> Vivek is horrible in the comic scenes, his timing is bad and goes well in the serious scenes For some reason he continues to do comedy and ruin his career Fardeen Khan is a little better but too much of wood Among the rest Esha and Amrita are the heroines that Boman Irani annoys here Snehal Dabbi is fine
