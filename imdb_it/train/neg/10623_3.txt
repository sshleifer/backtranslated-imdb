"Three Daring Daughters" is a sickly, pink-colored look at divorce, new marriage and life as single parents. Obviously, social issues and economic difficulties have no place in the perfect image of a single mother mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then goes out and marries a conductor. Even when the phrase "it's just a movie" excuses the script from facing the problems of real life, 'Daughters' suffers from too many inconsistent songs and high notes, children whose personalities are not based on real children and the leader of the band Hose Iturbi playing himself. Isn't it bizarre that a real person can act in a movie where their supposedly true self gets married? <br /> <br /> Of course, this film was released in the 1940s. Only a love for romance and old-fashioned Hollywood comedy could make "Daughters" a tolerable film.
