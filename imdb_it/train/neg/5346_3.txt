I had to watch this movie because the plot was so outrageous and the film was up to expectations. In fact it sometimes makes the vision quite uncomfortable. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual antics are kept to a minimum. Some scenes of violence are unnecessarily free and offensive. The plot is chaotic and part of the acting and the jokes are terrible. <br /> <br /> The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window on the brutality and immorality of slavery and fails on all fronts. It is as if Meyer was trying to make up for sexual exploitation / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty for being excited by the showy dominating connotations of the first scene that show Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative dress. He then tries to return to the right path, transforming it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, since they cancel each other out, you don't end up with anything. <br /> <br /> Because it's so ugly in so many ways, it's worth watching if you appreciate the art of making a terrible movie in the worst possible taste. Maybe, because it's so ugly, we almost let Meyer get by with the unacceptable.
