The film starts with 3 people meeting at the bar. OK. They are talking about their imaginary lives, lying all the time, for no reason. Still OK. From time to time, they even make you laugh. Interesting. You really like the first 30 minutes! But then ... things get worse ... Nothing has been happening ... for a long time ... and then, when something happens, all you can see are the old naked "ladies" touching each other! Not well. Disgusting! By the way, this part should be the top of the film, but that's all but that! The film makes no sense, it's boring and sick! <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that here (Belgrade, Serbia) on FEST (film festival), this film was the most popular according to research, of course, before people looked at it! I even thought (before looking): "Hay, it could be interesting, even if it's a Russian movie"! But, God, No !!!!
