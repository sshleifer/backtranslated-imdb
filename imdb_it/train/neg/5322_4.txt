There are two types of musicals from the 50s. First of all you have the MGM productions coated with big names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second rate directors. 'The Girl Can not Help It' belongs to this last category. Neither Tom Ewell nor Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, it doesn't matter. It seems that every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is as thin as a razor blade and one cannot help but suspect that it is primarily an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or other 50s rock artists that appear in the film. If you like this music, it's worth watching. If not, don't worry.
