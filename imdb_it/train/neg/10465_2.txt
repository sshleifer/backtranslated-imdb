I really wish I wasn't writing this review. I'm a Christian, so I waited anxiously to see this movie. It seemed fantastic - a Christian movie with some pretty famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing (not that I bought the Biblical Code itself - you can make it say whatever you want. Anyway, I believe in everything in the Bible ). So I'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews, when the movie turns on and manages to destroy my mood in minutes. I had to bite my lip to stop commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater (I would have been torn to pieces by the people who applauded the rather clumsy but basically uplifting and panting scenes for the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scene, I am sure). Once the credits began to turn, however, I could reflect. There were many parts of the film that I liked - some mostly unexpected twists, some effects that were really special (I'm not counting the Visions, those were badly done), and some interesting technical work - fades, sets, that kind of thing Unfortunately, I had the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and put the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour, I could get a better script. And the music was beyond bad taste (even for a Bond fan who loves some cheesy music in action and intrigue scenes). So I wish I could be like anyone else in the theater - like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was - but I'm not a person who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words on a Biblical Shell and slap on it a Christian brand. I need a good storyline and a credible dialogue before I can enjoy most of the movies, and I didn't get that either. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. And this is the tragedy. When will we see some intelligent Christian genius? It must be out there somewhere ...
