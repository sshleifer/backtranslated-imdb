The film looks super on paper. A romantic comedy in which a frenetic lover is dragged into a smuggling thriller should be a generic crossover gold, especially with this excellent romantic cast. <br /> <br /> I fear that Lawrence Kasdan simply gives too two stars to his two rope stars however and they go and hang themselves. Adam Brooks's script could be to blame, but you would expect better from Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda. Instead the two ping-pong tables against each other and the unlikely flourishing romanticism never satisfies satisfactorily with the reason why both are around France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno co-stars amiably like the cop-at-heart and I imagine he wanted to be a star-with-a-part. Mind you for the remake of Pink Panther (s!), So maybe he was fine with this ... 3/10
