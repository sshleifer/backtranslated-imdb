I liked it, I really did it. Please don't think I'm an idiot but I have to admit I liked this movie. I expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes it's okay to relax and watch a lousy movie you don't have to concentrate on too much, do you? I didn't expect hidden meanings or morales, and there wasn't, but it doesn't matter, because I just watched it for fun, and entertained me all the time. Movies like this are why Ben Stillers (excusing "there's something about Mary" and Vince Vaughns (however you spell his last name, I couldn't be bothered to check) have a job. It's okay to watch a shitty movie until you expect too much from it, and I will first take a position, jog, maybe run, but don't drive because I don't have a car, for Blockbuster Video, or even the Choices, and we hire a series of these humorous toilet films and we look at them overnight. Good day to you reader. If you do not say that this comment has helped you, then I do not like you, if you say it was helpful then God bless you, you will go to heaven.
