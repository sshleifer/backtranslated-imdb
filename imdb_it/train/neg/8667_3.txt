This sports a beautiful and deep cast, but for a thriller it's better to offer more than the names of the actors and talk. The first third of this film was nothing more than talking and talking more. Most of this was a group of women complaining about each other. <br /> <br /> The first five actors listed here are women in a way that verifies that it really is a "chicken movie" and little else. This probably plays on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> There was a scene of quick murder and then more talk. Halfway, they had lost me. <br /> <br /> By the way, Sally Field was about 15 in here.
