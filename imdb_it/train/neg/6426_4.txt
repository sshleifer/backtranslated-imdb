I found the documentary titled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control as a rather interesting documentary. The documentary contained four "mini" documentaries on four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in his work, showing pure love and fun for his work. <br /> <br /> The sad part, I must say, should be the subjects in which these people worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, then they became boring and last too long. <br /> <br /> The video was shot in a very creative way. I really liked the movie of one thing with a double voice compared to another. It turned out to be excellent and also coincided well with the music.
