As a child the first episode ("La sirenetta") was my favorite movie. It was full of great characters, songs and a fun family movie. A week or so I watched this movie for the first time. I believe this film was like most sequels and did not exceed their original. I think I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I grew up. However, it's not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful baby boy, Melody. Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana (the sister of Eurselas), so they build a large wall around their house which is on the sea. As Melody grows, she begins to wonder outside the walls where it is forbidden to go. The problems are set in motion when Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away any of the movies, so you have to see it to find out. I liked that the voices were the same and again a wonderful song. I think this is a good family film, even if it's a whole one!
