This movie was a stupid piece of shit. Evil all Why are we the ones who love westerns to be caught nine times out of ten when we rent westerns? It seems that if you don't see names like Robert Duval, Kevin Kostner or Tom Selleck attached to the cover, it's not worth joking. For the most part the main action of Shiloh Falls was in progress in 1892, but the used revolvers were models of 1860. The shot was also bad - in one scene the marshal waved his shooter six times about nine times he couldn't hit any of the three big men who were only twenty yards away. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes of this inanity. Perhaps those who participated in this film could have taken some lessons at Sunset Carson School of Acting.
