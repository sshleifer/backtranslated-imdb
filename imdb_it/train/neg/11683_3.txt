Three narrative lines and not enough tying them together, "Inside Man" was very nervous and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic. Despite having his moments, the film started to look like a fast thriller that quickly approached a slow scan, quickly jumped between ups and downs, and only barely resumed steam in the last 20 minutes. I will credit Denzel Washington, he played his part extremely well with a full understanding of his human side and not just the typical "super-detective" with all the answers. Even Clive Owen has done quite well with his part of duality as "evil genius" and "criminal mind" (both are not the same in retrospect). Overall, however, each person individually created a large subsection. Yet when the parties finally came together and counted, there was no sudden "ah-ha!" or the sum of everything. Everything ended up with very little energy started, with lots of holes in the plot, tons of questions and, as I said before, it's not close to Spike Lee's normal level. I have to completely disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... this is not the film they play.
