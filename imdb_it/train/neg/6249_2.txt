(r # 97) <br /> <br /> There is a good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (do what you want): the opening theme. It must be the coolest theme music on any Japanese anime TV show damned made for consumers-oops-or-young-the-young-fans. Unfortunately there was a need to add some sort of show after the opening theme. And they couldn't find anything more interesting than the people who talk loudly about which cards are better than the cards of others. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can't imagine why children want to attend a show in which the dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the execution time. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your paltry Animal Diamond Pyramid in one shot! Don't you see you have no chance of winning this battle, mad?! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA!" <br /> <br /> "Oh yes? Well, look at this! I'm going to use my Delta Destruction Force Pie Card Dexterity that eradicates each of your Power Munchers and makes your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom's useless Destroy Beyond all Significance Attack! I bet you didn't see it coming! "<br /> <br /> Seriously, that's all they do on this show, talk. While in another show of disgusting children I was watching, namely the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (the concern of every soccer mom), at least the monsters had the courtesy to pull it out every once in a while, "Yu-Gi-Oh" is simply , with the quiet words of Roger Ebert's review of A Clockwork Orange, "talkative and boring". Not to mention long-winded (I realize I am a hypocrite here considering the sentence I just wrote). <br /> <br /> This show goes on forever. I don't know if there's a plot, and static monsters don't have the character of Pokémon. Although not compared to my favorite comic strip, this show sucks. It's unintentionally fun, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Hi, sleep strong, dreams wet dreams.
