An actress who makes a film in Africa is kidnapped and taken to the jungle where she is detained for ransom. The producer hires someone to go and bring her back. Complicating everything is the cannibals in the jungle who adore a really ugly-looking "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is an unpleasant film. There are abundant amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It is an exploitative film designed to attract the darkest parts of our being, and if the film were not so boring this movie would be a classic. We face it, despite the blood, the bad sex and the abuse, and the ugly monster that this film is a snoozer. The pace is crazy and puts you out of the game. There are more plot lines that seem to happen separately from one another, even if ultimately it's all a story. Worse still, almost nobody says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue is about the cruelty or protests of a character who "will do what I want". It is such a silent and boring film that if it were not for the frequent screams of the victims I would recommend it as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need to sleep, or unless you need to see all the Euro-cannibal movies. <br /> <br /> (A part.

Their print is strangely letter-boxed which seems to be the result of their printing from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that has been cropped to remove subtitles.
