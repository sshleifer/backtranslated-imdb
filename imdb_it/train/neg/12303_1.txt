This film is so bad that it's okay - in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn't stop watching it, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, a wife of an oppressed preacher who falls in love with Luke (Corey Sevier), a mysterious and mysterious tramp who we eventually discover is in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Mind you, it's not worse than the other actors. You have the feeling that the actors don't have * idea * to be in a really terrible movie; they are playing straight. Everything about the film is ugly: acting, script, love scenes, rhythm, twists, the choice of music. The climate scenes are so ridiculous - first the church shooting, then Luca's last words to Emily - I was screaming with laughter. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Luca did a lot of weight lifting and crunching in prison, and we were able to see a lot of his naked torso. This is probably the highlight of the film.
