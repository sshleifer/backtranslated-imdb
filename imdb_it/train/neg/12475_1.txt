I don't remember leaving a movie theater except this time. Not only that, but I was with 7 friends, and we all wanted to go. An uninteresting plot, characters made of clay, meaningless violence. I didn't care when the good guys died; I didn't care when the bad guys understood it. Fantasy and magic were put on like a liver pudding and there was no consistency. In short, great entertainment if you happen to spend an eternity in hell.
