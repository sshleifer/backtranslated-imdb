Nowhere near the original. It's a fairly accurate copy that brings nothing new to the story. But the direction is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good direction. Baldwin is simply a second championship compared to McQueen. I looked at it only out of curiosity, being a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B series film with second-level acting and direction. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and in fact it doesn't have a good actor of its time. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of a bad copy of the xerox of a wonderful photograph. <br /> <br /> This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or look at the original (again :)))
