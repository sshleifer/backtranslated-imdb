There was a lot of love that was included in "Fantastic Mr Fox" by Wes Anderson, unfortunately all love is for himself. Sure, there has been a lot of time and effort to create this universe so conscious and bizarre, but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try to make it fun. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could invent. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the close-ups of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really hard for the eyes and to be perfectly honest it seems a bit of a disaster. There was nothing special about acting, with Wes choosing to choose his friends and big names with more specialized voice actors who would probably have made the film better. I'm pretty sure that George Clooney's vocal curriculum consists of two cameos in South Park, one of which was a dog. <br /> <br /> The film is too smug and tries too hard to be smart and it's different, and it's typical, although the film is set in England, all the good animals are the typical Americans who play baseball, while the bad guys are stereotyped English with the most offensive English accents. I can't stress how much time this film is wasted. I didn't laugh once.
