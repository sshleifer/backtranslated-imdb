This film sucked simple and simple. Okay, so it's basically a girl who gets raped and gets another boy to take revenge for the rapist. The rapist is an idiot, but the girl's victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff like that, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, he won't let her, so the rapist rapes her. And the fact is that the rape scene for the girl is very short and doesn't expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rape being raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. There is practically nothing in history that is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> 3.2 / 10
