This film was another waste of time ... Why, why do I keep teasing poop like this? ... someone, please tell me ... * sigh * Oh good. back to the film in hand: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really really like the first movie, (like I did), and you just want to see what happens in the last movie (hopefully) scraped together just to keep it of scarce actors and scriptwriters employed, so obviously this is the right movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with a good acting and a fantastic plot ... * diabolical sneer * then this movie is definitely for you :-D .... OK I'm lying ... At best this movie sucks. OK, I have to admit that some elements were beautiful ... well ... rather cold ... and I laughed several times, prolly to the wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But all in all the few things that barely make the "ok" category are not enough to make this movie worthy of this. Unless you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten films EVER!
