Please, even if you are in the worst way, don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't think there was anything right about this movie. On the advice of a friend I saw this and literally emptied 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life in the closet. Poor acting, stupid direction, weak plot and pathetic action sequences - and when they blend together you get "Double Impact". Even less than expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I learned one thing: never look at Van Damme's action movies. I am pure waste of time!
