(this could be a bit exaggerated) I would like to start by saying that I didn't watch the whole movie, nor could I because it was obvious from the first hour that I would be incredibly disappointed. This of course is the problem with taking, what many believe is a fantastic book, and turning it into a Disney TV movie. <br /> <br /> A Wrinkle in Time should have been turned into a fantastic movie a long time ago. It has a fantastic plot that could hook children and adults. It is also built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying wasn't the way to go. The problem with the film is that all the things that have changed to turn it into a visual story have silenced what was so exceptional in the book. It's a complicated and exciting story for children. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely "psychic", because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a struggle between the three Mrs W as an additional tension, there is enough tension in the story without it. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... this deprived us of what may have been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg happening in the book. <br /> <br /> I could do the nap for days about little things, but I also think that bigger things, like art direction, were off. Take for example the way they made Camazotz appear, with its strangely obscured skies. The creepiness that emerges in the book is that the Camazotz could be the Earth. It looks like earth. There are people who look human. The skies are blue, the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz another complete instead of taking the lesson from the book and applying it to the general direction of the film. The lesson of course is that the Camazotz could very well be the Earth, that is if we forget how to love. It would have been far stranger to have a nice afternoon walking down the street with the children bouncing their balls in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I didn't see the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end. <br /> <br /> Overall an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />
