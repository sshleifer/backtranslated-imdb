I can't believe how popular this show is. I consider myself an avid sci-fi fan. I have read countless science fiction novels and enjoyed many science fiction films and television programs. I really wouldn't even consider this true sci-fi. Every episode I heard was like a crippled and dazed version of a Star Trek episode, minus anything that could make it interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It is basically a group of people who wander around in the ARMY world of armor, talking about something boring, that occasionally goes through the Stargate and ends up on a planet that looks like Earth, with people who look and sound just like humans! It seemed like an extremely low budget. The characters are all forgettable one-dimensional glimpses, and the many attempts at humor fall to the ground. It reminds me of when you see an advertisement with a famous athlete, trying to be funny, but it's not. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> Even the film was terrible. There is so much you can do with a portal through space, but in every place that the people of ARMY are driving away! This shows no imagination! Actually I thought that the TV series "Alien Nation" of some years ago (based on the movie Alien Nation) was much better. That program actually had a good storyline and decent characters. I wasn't crazy about "Alien Nation", but compared to this overrated shit, it was great! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, unlike the great new series "Battlestar Galactica", "Stargate" has copied the look and feel of the lame movie too closely! They should at least have updated the special "toilet flushing" effect when someone passes through the Stargate.
