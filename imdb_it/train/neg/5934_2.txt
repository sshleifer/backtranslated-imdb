I wouldn't consider myself one of the greatest fans of Leonard Cohen. However, he appears as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is listening to Leonard's reflections on his life and career. Warm and humble. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately most of the musicians in the concert did not discuss the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary mode. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and Beth Orton were the exceptions, although Leonard greatly appreciates Rufus Wainrights' interpretations of his songs. <br /> <br /> What particularly failed in this documentary was the director's ability to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect with him. Much is said about this, but the viewer is not attracted to the person Leonard Cohen. This failure is particularly evident in interviews with Bono and The Edge. They consider Leonard a special icon, but they cannot translate their exact value of Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. The entire live recording seems like a rushed job. And just like in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can tell his part. <br /> <br /> The entire editing and screenplay is very similar to an extramural high school project. The use of effects such as echo, slow motion or flashing images is not correct. Some of the photo jobs are sad. Part of the score hardly remembers the associations I would have expected. Sometimes it seemed that the director added psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to its use of LSD once. <br /> <br /> A little involuntary humor ... at one point Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre. Initially he can't remember the name of the genre, until he finally says it was punk, the punksters really understood his music. The next scene in the film is a live cover of 'I can not forget' ... <br /> <br /> "And I can't forget, I can't forget I can't forget but I can't forget I remember who"
