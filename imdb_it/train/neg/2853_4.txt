Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mafia boss, who leaves a mental institution, returns to his gangster world. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very beautiful), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and make such a waste of time? This film is a comedy that is not funny, with a constellation in the cast. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' ("The pleasure of killing you!") <br /> <br />
