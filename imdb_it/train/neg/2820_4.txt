I don't know much about Tobe Hooper, or why he took his name in the title, but maybe he shouldn't have worried. As another commentator mentioned, there's really not enough horror or erotica to get fans of both genres. The plot is inconsistent, Sade's sequences are free and most of the acting is so-so. Englund was doing his best with weak material, and Zoe Trilling has a really great bottom, but neither is enough to bring this film. This is a cassette. Degree: F
