Once again, like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, a TV series is transformed into a full-length movie and is ruined for all the hundreds of people who have watched. Basically the duke's cousins, Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County, spend a lot of time driving very quickly in "The General Lee". But they need to act together and stop their family farm destroyed along with almost the entire city by the ugly Boss Hogg of Jefferson Davis (named Razzie Burt Reynolds) to make way for a huge coal mine. They receive help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (nominated by Razzie Jessica Simpson) and uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson), while being chased by the same sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M.C. Gainey) and the police. He also played Joe Don Baker as Governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as Member of Parliament Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Vice Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason why I give the film an extra star is for a couple of impressive car stunts and, of course, for the magnificent body of Simpson (I admit his legs aren't really Catherine Bach, but anyway!), But beyond that it's pretty boring. He was named Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Jay Chandrasekhar, Worst Remake or Sequel, Worst Screen Couple for Simpson & Her "Daisy Dukes" and Worst Screenplay. Poor enough!
