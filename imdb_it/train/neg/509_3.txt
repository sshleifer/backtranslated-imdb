This film is about World War II British prisoners of war fleeing a camp in Germany. <br /> <br /> I find "The Wooden Horse" to be tediously boring. The subject could have been electrifying, full of suspense and adrenaline, but "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very simple way. It is a collection of simple and badly told events, without suspension and thrill. The first semester clearly tells how prisoners of war have dug a tunnel, but the events are so simple, with not enough mistakes and shaves to make me fooled. The last half of the film is even worse, they are simply moving from place to place without a cat and mouse hunt. And the characters could talk a little less and get more action in an action movie! I'm disappointed with "The Wooden Horse", wasted the potential to be a great movie.
