I imagine there are some out there who remember Nicole Eggert of her childhood days in TV shows like T.J. Hooker, Charles in charge, and Who's the Boss? Perverted, you! Perhaps you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and had breast implants. Never mind, you will surely forget it in this alleged comedy about man-eating aliens. <br /> <br /> There are so many things that make no sense and are never explained. How did you recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the alien eat it? Take the photo. <br /> <br /> Before the alien eats his boyfriend and assumes his identity, you can see it in Alex Meneses' body. This Mexican / Ukrainian beauty is the only reason to look at this garbage. Stay with the shower scene and the boyfriend, and keep talking about your business.
