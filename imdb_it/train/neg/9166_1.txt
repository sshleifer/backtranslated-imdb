Recherche is a good word to describe this film. <br /> <br /> Let's say that every movie has a store, a gimmick. The trick of the Transformers is the fantastic effect and the nostalgia of the fans. Insomnia in the make-up of Seattle is situational in their line of demarcation, "And if someone you've never met, someone you've never seen, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many love stories rely heavily on these tricks and some through the design of big names. Leap Years uses both Irish folklore and circumstance and has considerably famous names within the country. <br /> <br /> So now that the public is in the cinema, in addition to all the usual elements in characters, conflicts or consequences, crisis, resolution and epilogue, they can't wait to stimulate dialogue, the most absorbing situations as a result of leap years, interesting sub-plots and perhaps, up to a certain point, a good turn in half or towards the end of a story that favors the circumstances of the characters. <br /> <br /> This is what Jean Yeo is trying not to do. If they tried, their goal was apparently in the other court, in the other stage, on the other side of the planet. She and her writer, Alain Layrac, failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most lines have been built. They seem to have a bag full of lines that he would like to use in his film: "Ok, these are the lines and quotes that I heard or read from the films I saw or the books I read before and they all look good to me, they sound good they will sound good to the public, so all I have to do is join them all together, I will use them all ". The result is cathartic. I cannot say that the lines were useless and had no connection with history or in guiding the plot, but they seem to come out of nowhere, taking you by surprise with these quotable quotations. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotations based on most situations in our dialogue, trying to make it meaningful to themselves while they nod. I no longer go out with them because the urge to beat them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the characters portrayed are foolish and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue that implies their motivation (necessary to guide the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. They are all simple that emit lines from the column of the councils of a women's magazine. <br /> <br /> The trick in leap years is not enough to guide the story because the circumstances are too superficial. Then again, there are films with less but better than that, they are not there. They made my first and second points. Furthermore, sub-frames are irrelevant (not bad for movies) and thin (bad things). <br /> <br /> Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to pass on the terrible plot with imaginative places and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to get the approval of some viewers than the others with the good use of cinematography, the soundtrack and the location of the shooting. These non-discerning viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that is so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Don't look at this.
