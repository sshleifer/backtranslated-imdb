I didn't know it was a silent film with narration. I don't care for silent films - trivial humor, flickering lights, movies, etc. I'm sure he attributes to the low score I gave him. It was about chapter 8, before I found an interest in this story and if I had popcorn, I could have thrown it on the screen. Perhaps this appeals to the science fiction crowd? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the entire theater. Isabella Rosselinni narrated this film - the only pleasant aspect of the film. No one left comments on how much he liked them, nor did he appreciate the unusual approach in telling this story. I can't recommend this movie.
