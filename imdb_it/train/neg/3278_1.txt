I must say that many people have claimed that some of us need to stay with the times because the new movie "Dukes" is a modernized version. OH PLEASE. If this is what you consider modernized, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said this (and I quote) "The foggy old people need to overcome it and except how it is". Well, let me tell you something, I am 24 years old, so I am very far from being and OLD FOGIE, and I will not exceed it, it was a DISGREGATION FOR EVERYTHING BY HAZZARD. The only right thing in the film's title was "HAZZARD". All vulgarity, smoking and drinking were really necessary. The cast was terrible. Jessica participated in several morning shows to discuss the film and frankly I think they all went to the head. It is not in any way a Daisy Duke, perhaps a stroke of luck, but certainly no Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast at least as a cameo, but Hollywood also knew they wouldn't approve the script. I mean, come on people, even today's actors and actresses express a negative opinion, so why some of you give positive comments.
