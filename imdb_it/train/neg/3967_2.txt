DARK REMAINS is a low-cost American horror film that somehow managed to win 2 awards. <br /> <br /> The plot seems to involve two separate strands. First, a woman commits suicide by cutting her wrists while taking a bath. Second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with a torn throat. The mourning couple decides to move to an isolated mountain hut. Later it happens that the cabin and the surrounding areas are infested. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, the two separate strands of history eventually converge as might reasonably be expected. However, execution is random and generates confusion that could only be solved by multiple views. Unfortunately, the film is simply not attractive enough to attract most viewers to watch it more than once. <br /> <br /> Almost everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! And the reduced budget cannot be used to justify all the shortcomings found here. I think it would be wrong to pass judgment on the actors involved in this production because the material was simply too poor. /> <br /> The characters are not interesting as pointed out by other reviewers of this site. The poorly written script introduces too many people without offering them interesting dialogues, without creating opportunities for character-based situations and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> Management is not inspired. The inspiration of the J-Horror films like RINGU, THE GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL is evident. Unfortunately, the directors of DARK REMAINS have not paid much attention to the style of J-Horror. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays on the fear of the unknown. The tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a CCTV camera that comes close to it), and the reaction of a central character who finds himself facing it without any warning. There is no humor or ironic element in these films. Everything is played so directly and without remorse or limitations that you cannot help but be convinced and fascinated. The presumptuous atmospheres create suspense and ensure that the horror has a psychological impact, very different from the "jump scares" used in Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> The directors of DARK REMAINS have made a bold attempt to avoid Hollywood clichés and even successfully avoided using CGI. The tribute to J-Horror could have been well understood. Unfortunately, the lack of inspiration risks making the viewer laugh at the supposed "fears" on the screen. The effects of the "ghost" make-up were not so bad given the low budget, but their actions defied logic. I scratched my head quite a few times during this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not give up in the end, even if I wanted to. I simply couldn't understand it. All I could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> What remains? The answer as a reviewer on a different website has stressed is boredom. The film is a task to sit on. Fortunately, the pain ends after an hour and a half. However, most probably go out long before the end. <br /> <br /> There are only two positive things I found in this film: the successful avoidance of the scary clichés and the absence of the "f-word" in every single sentence like the one you would normally expect of to find. Here's what the 2 stars are for. <br /> <br /> Those who love the supernatural or psychological horror of ghosts and haunting might do well to stick with films like THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING or J- Subgenre of horror. <br /> <br /> If you think you have seen too many established films and want to see an obscure "bas-relief" horror film about ghosts, look at the DEATH OF A GHOST HUNTER. It may not be the greatest horror film ever made, but it is certainly much better than DARK REMAINS and has some real surprises in store. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone to avoid dark RAYS like the plague.
