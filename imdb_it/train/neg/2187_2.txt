I bought this movie on DVD to get an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are watchable, because the film itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story that can be followed and some actors who can act, there is nothing else. The film was so boring, I firmly confirmed that I will never watch it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. As summarized above, however, it was better than the film featured in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
