With a list of casts like this, I expected much better. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film in bed. The best actresses in the world cannot make anything very interesting when their acting is limited to lying down and falling asleep during the whole movie. The plot summary says that a secret is revealed to the daughters as the mother approaches death. The fact is that she never tells her daughters anything except a cryptic advice about being happy. All the relationships in the film are underdeveloped. I also felt that back and forth between past and present was not necessary. It seemed that the idea was stolen both from the Da Vinci Code book where the device was used to increase suspense, and from the notebook in which they used the device to create the infinite love story of the main characters of the story. Either way it was a cheap device in this film because it didn't work to create something. It was a way to experience suspense in a film that has none. I left to wonder why good films cannot be written for women. It was really a disappointment.
