This film (along with Rinne) is a small jewel among the photos of reconstructed tributes that have been transmitted for the horror film to date "HorrorFest" by 8FTDF. And yes, this is true praise. Because in cinema there is not much worse than aspiring authors who think that the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the director's head. Of course, it would have been nice if he had transferred it to film, but instead it happened. It is a very nice film with few genuine scare, but the last reel is strictly dedicated to the crowd of filmmakers who drink milk.
