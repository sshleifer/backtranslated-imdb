I first learned of Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's "Scary Stories" books: according to this story, the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you forward and then drags you to heaven pulverize you. Although it seems a rather bizarre idea, Schwartz's story has turned it into a fairly coherent idea. <br /> <br /> The movie "Wendigo" no. Basically it consists of every clich√© of horror films: the family moves into a new home and strange things start happening, whoever hurts them is asking, and everyone should listen to the old Indian. I've seen this stuff so many times that I don't care to count anymore. <br /> <br /> However, avoid it. Patricia Clarkson and Erik Per Sullivan (Dewey on "Malcolm in the Middle") have done much better than that.
