All involved (and the public) should look for "The Candidate" to see how good this movie would have been. What happened to South American history? What were they thinking about Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw to allow their roles to be cut out of cardboard. So far, I've enjoyed every Gene Hackman performance and / or film. He was either disinterested (which I can hardly believe) or terribly mixed. I also appreciated and defended Richard Gere (and I was denigrated). But he had no "power" here. It has never been intimidating and only occasionally persuasive. All in all I was very disappointed. I expected a lot more from this director and the cast. If you can't find "The Candidate" watch "Wag the dog" again or even "Bulworth".
