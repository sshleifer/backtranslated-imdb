Lampoon's biggest national success remains "Animal House", and rightly so. It was fun, raucous and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of any other national Lampoon movie. Including "Class Reunion". <br /> <br /> PLEASE don't be fooled by the inclusion of Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or from the fact that John Hughes wrote this confusing chaos. This reunion is as fun as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star, and it's generous. Besides, I always thought that most of my old classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers.
