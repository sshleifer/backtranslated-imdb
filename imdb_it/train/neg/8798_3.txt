I like a movie that has at least a trace of a story. This does not occur in this film. It is a series of vignettes without cohesion. <br /> <br /> There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blonde wig never removes her sunglasses. This woman shoots other people at the beginning of the film and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another flirtatious woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes in a fast food restaurant where the "California Dreaming" by Mamas & Papas is enormously exaggerated (I liked the song). The dialogue is mainly about food (pineapple, chef's salad and ordered drinks ??). I assume that most of the actors gained weight during this film because many fast foods were consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this film because there is no story. This is supposedly a novel - it's not like that. I just wonder why I didn't hit Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something meaningful to happen ?? It is not so. Perhaps this is the only consolation for this film - the scenes have changed so quickly that you have assumed that there would be a revelation to all the absurdities.
