Wow, I'm a big fan of Henry VIII / Tudor and, well, this was .... interesting. The only one I saw was that of Catherine of Aragon. And wow ... just wow. I've seen bad acting before, but this has reached new heights. When the actress who played Catherine was umm .. crying? she screams and screams and I have to admit that I have rewound many times ... many, many times .... funny, funny things. The only person who even showed a small bit of talent was the actress who plays Anne Boleyn (I could be prejudiced, I have a slight obsession with Anne Boleyn, she was a really charming woman, I read them, it was worth it! Besides , I read a lot about the Tudor period and I think the characters weren't very sharply displayed, they were all very stereotyped, only watch this movie if you're ready to see a very important period of time and the important lives of those involved become in a laughing stock.
