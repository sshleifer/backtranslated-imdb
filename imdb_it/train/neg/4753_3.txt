The director F.W. Murnau wisely attached to the medium of the silent film he knew so well to cover this story of native island life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful and the daily activities of the islanders are interesting to observe. The film loses momentum, however, when it begins to focus more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The plot is never so interesting, despite being managed well by Murnau. He won an Oscar for best photography, although the prize probably should have been the best scenario. The DP cannot really be credited with having filmed in such a beautiful location.
