.... because if I were, I could have wished you to be crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I've been "generous" that there was even a plot to begin with. As mentioned above, on the cover of the DVD is a misnomer that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. It was barely in the movie. And if he was really "frustrated" as the back cover indicated that it was, well, it's probably because he said YES to be in this movie mess and couldn't get out of it! The film really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what his role in the film would be, apart from close-ups, it wasn't a mystery like what Gene Barry really was - or he wasn't. And speaking of "great" ... anyone who had the brilliant idea of ​​dressing up Gene Barry with the Humpty Dumpty attire, who showed his pants literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to difficult times watching this sober film. I could go on and on about this horrendous film, from the dialogue that did not correspond to the mouths of the "actors" (think of Clutch's Cargo), to the irregular leap from one scene to another (again, being generous even calling the frames of the "scene" images), to the lack of a plot .... However, if you like the early 70s and if you are in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of photos of children and cats, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before embarking on this strange ride of a movie because you'll be grateful that you might not remember it the next day!
