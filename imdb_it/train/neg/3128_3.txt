... from this horrible movie! There are so many things that don't go in the film, in acting, writing, directing, editing, etc. Which is surprising that something goes up and proves to be the absolute worst. The music! I noticed that the film has two listed composers. This must be the reason why every single frame has the music, of the absolute worst "D" film drivel style. They have never heard of the expression "less is more". It was painful to listen, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was so beautiful. You must be sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they haven't seen roles like this in the twilight of their career. Look at your own risk.
