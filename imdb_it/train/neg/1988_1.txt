Okay, I passed the horrible acting. I passed by the fact that Lil Kim was blowing up some cannons and her arms or her hands didn't move, I passed the armor, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> This is what killed him for me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table discussing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, and then Lil Kim gets up to break hostilities saying "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold up. Let's do CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND." I'm a fan of the western film genre, and I've never heard anyone speak this way in one of Clint Eastwood's films. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks this movie deserves more than one vote, please tell me another movie is worse than Gang of Roses. <br /> <br /> I'm through.
