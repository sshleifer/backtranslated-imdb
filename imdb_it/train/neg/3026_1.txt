apparently based on the life of Domino Harvey, a model who became a bounty hunter. I would say that 95% is manufactured. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this film lost its chances when it became clear that it had a narrative throughout the film, something I can't stand, and finally, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b! I just wanted it to end with his headshot. it's too inconsistent, too flashy and too boring, it's one that makes a crap story, and I really think that great-time filmmakers have to make films based on their own or a writer's imagination, not something based on a rude life snobby and ignorant.
