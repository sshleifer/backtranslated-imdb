Ben, a policeman outside the city is convinced that his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring his murderer to justice, but is approached by Stefan who believes his sister was the victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan, go to Transylvania to end this evil. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly horrible B-level thing and I wondered how it was released. Makes the original 'Howling' a true masterpiece. What did Christopher Lee think, as this was his worst performance I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of wrong with this real low-cost movie, ranging from the hammam and wood performances of Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forget about Lee ), poor fashion (those sunnies), shoddy and shoddy special effects, misuse of lighting, humor ... if there were some trash music from the 80s (with some films focusing on some unknown bands playing), the werewolf has orgies that is a sight to behold and a tiring story with flat and annoying dialogues. I thought that if it was so bad it would be terribly funny, but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> The positives were that the location and settings of the film were fantastic, but that's all ... actually I'll also add Sybil Danning to the short stripping scene. <br /> <br /> During the closing credits of the band they play their crap-house song during a strange montage of scenes from the movie, which I mention to the question why? <br /> <br /> A horrible piece of casino, at least it's not boring. <br /> <br /> 1/5
