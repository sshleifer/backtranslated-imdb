This was just a terrible movie. It hurts me to see it. Almost all the actions were unfounded in the context of the film, the acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says anything about the film) and the plot was generally predictable. Some connections to Carlito's Way were fine, such as his one-day dream of moving to Carribien, but on the whole they were weak. Love interest in my opinion was wrong, but hey is questionable. However I didn't expect much before watching the film and I guess we could say that even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he is actually a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. Generally the films give a decent evaluation if they arouse my interest, so I go ahead and give this two stars. Next time you'll be luckier. And yes, I liked Carlito's way.
