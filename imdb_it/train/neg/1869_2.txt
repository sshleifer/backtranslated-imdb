Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is back with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei makes his film with a tiny budget - so it seems already obscure when it just came out. <br /> <br /> After her daughter has been kidnapped, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography, because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that runs snuff films as long as exclusive customers pay well. His daughter's research not only brings her mother throughout Europe, but also in prostitution. She sleeps with some guys to get her clues. When she finally makes contact with the snuff organization led by the mysterious Dr. Hades, she is putting herself in grave danger. <br /> <br /> There is not much good to say about this, even if it starts to promise. The problem is that the film is not as bad or bad as one might expect from the director who produced films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was released for the first time in Russia!) It is neither bloody enough nor contains the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot is not so special, except perhaps for the surprisingly many locations throughout Europe. The finish is extremely disappointing. The acting is not really remarkable, except Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hades: he looks and acts in an extremely disturbing way. You don't want to meet her this way in a dark alley (or in your bedroom, for that matter). <br /> <br /> All in all, SNUFF TRAP is aimed only at collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's nice to see the man at the helm again: it was his first thriller from the yellow GLI OCCHI DENTRO of 1994.
