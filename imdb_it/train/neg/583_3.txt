I bought this adaptation because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and I particularly like the BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be so bad: the whole series made me laugh a lot more than the novel moved me. <br /> <br /> First of all, the music (and songs) seems totally out of place in a period drama (it seems like it was written for a contemporary horror film) and as another commentator, I was particularly irritated from the way the cameras turned and circled around the actors. I saw some scenes shot that way in "North and South" and it seemed all right, but in The Tenant, it's definitely exaggerated and simply annoying. The camera movements cannot make wooden acting lively. <br /> <br /> Most of the second roles were difficult to distinguish at the beginning and the script lacked clarity. At first none of the characters had been presented correctly. The boy has given a good interpretation, it is very nice and the best feature of the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILER The characterization of Helen Graham by Tara Fitzgerald made her look cold and harsh, leaving no emotion through. He doesn't seem able to cry in a realistic way at all. I could not believe that Markham could have fallen in love with her and did not mention the horrible hairstyle she was given. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for her husband! I imagine being married to such a virago ... Besides, he was the only main actor that seemed right to me. Toby Stephens I found right, Helen Graham's brother is not very good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with subjects as depressing as alcoholism and cruelty. Furthermore, what is only hinted at and left to the reader's imagination in the book is complacently paused in the television adaptation: making some coarse and comic scenes, (like when Huntingdon's eye starts to bleed) and others too much too up for a vintage drama! I mean, don't we have enough of those bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
