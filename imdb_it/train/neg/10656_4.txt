What can I say. A film by Kamal Hassan is horrible. It behaves very well, but it's a horrible story, along with a horrible direction. According to my kind opinion, director Gautham Menon must give up directing. There is a lot of tragedy throughout the film. Apart from that, one cannot simply believe that those horrendous crimes were true. There was no practicality in the film. Gautham is running out of stories. But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika do really well. The bad guys seem too ugly, even if their performance wasn't bad. I don't think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa you can see with your family. You won't sleep seeing this movie !! However, Harris Jayaraj did a great job again, which is why I gave this film 4 out of 10. His song 'Partha Modail Nallae' is full of soul and reassuring. Apart from that, great cinematography. Overall, this is just a bad movie. Kamal Hassan, I think, should have rejected this film.
