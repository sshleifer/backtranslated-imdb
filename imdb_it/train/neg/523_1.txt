What goes through entertainment today is incredible to me. maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties, and I'm not in touch with today's movie generation, and apparently this is the case with this movie, since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't told you about many movies in my life, but this fits the project. Humor is sophomoric and crude. I'm not a politically correct person, and I even found gay jokes, not just not funny but definitely offensive (I'm not gay). The protagonist of the film is not even a nice person, just pathetic. When the film is finally finished, I heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just paid to see.
