I just saw the movie for the first time. I wanted to see it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of his first films. <br /> <br /> The film is about a girl (played by the beautiful young Drew Barrymore), who moves from New York to Los Angeles to overcome her recent loss. Shortly after moving into a boy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin = doppelganger, who persecutes her. <br /> <br /> The film is rather poor and very bad. Both the dialogues and the acting make the film not worthy of seeing it. Summarizing is just something for Drew Barrymore fans.
