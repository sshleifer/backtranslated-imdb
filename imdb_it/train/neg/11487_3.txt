Laurel and Hardy's best shorts are full of mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by Stan, but with Ollie receiving the most (!) Punishment-- see the great 'The Music Box' (1933) or 'Towed in a Hole' (1932) as some classic examples. <br /> <br /> Here, however, for some reason (is it because it's based on a sketch by Stan's father?) The boys play it straight 'in a' comedy 'built around jokes and seemingly fun situations. It doesn't come off. It's just another boring 1930s, third-class comedy, only intensified by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never show any of their branded gestures (Ollie's fingers, Stan's white stars, etc.) or comic abilities. <br /> <br /> The film starts with them running away from the police. Since we don't see or ever know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being discovered, and therefore hiding in Colonel Buckshot's villa. The premise for "humor", Ollie pretends to be Colonel and Stan who passes away while both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. They are not playing "Stan and Ollie" in this movie. Their parts could have been interpreted by any of the actors of the pedestrian office and would be equally poor. <br /> <br /> Stan could mimic and do whatever he wants to do fun, but he doesn't have the chance to do any of this here. He is forced to utter too many dialogues to "move" the plot, but none of them rises much above the stupid. We are treated to endless third-class comic chestnuts like the gag running to not correctly pronounce the name of Lord Plumtree, "Call me a taxi! Okay you're a taxi!" joke, cops who lose their clothes and are seen in long underwear, and a non-sequencer finale by Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully noticeable horse costume as they run away for two and James Finlayson is still doing her body full of silences and scene-taking and Keystone Kop jumping. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie do much better in a comic situation in "Children of the Desert" (1933) where we can see them doing what they love about them - being themselves. In fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years. <br /> <br /> Since this film does not play with any of their strengths, why worry about it? I have to give him a 3.
