This film seems made for TV. For years I waited for a Rubin Carter movie to be produced, because I liked seeing it box at the old MSG, and seeing this movie was very disappointing. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Washington, but he was terrible and boring. There is nothing good to say about this film, except that I like the song.
