Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies, I expected a little more from his western than I received. Well, I enjoyed it all right. I laughed almost as much watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles. <br /> <br /> Watch the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting them if an otherwise boring scene happens. And the horses seem to have gears in them too, considering the fast forward pursuits. Also look at the queens of the swinging ballroom of the traditional wild saloon that makes a number that recalls a certain fashionable dance of the 1920s, here decades before the style was invented. I hope the salon around them does not crumple. <br /> <br /> In the midst of all this chaos the main players do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all really good. A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems to have been mostly removed from "Johnny Guitar", but it doesn't impress in the same way. But there's really nothing wrong with a ridiculous Western like this. Just like an old really bad horror movie, it could fail in one way, but still manages to give joy. This is one of the reasons why Corman's work attracts me and that is why I allow myself to recommend you to try this movie if you have the chance.
