This film should take place in and around Seattle. Why is Porteau Cove's P-R-O-V-I-N-C-I-A-L shown? The provincial parks are in CANADA, and not in the United States. The inspector uses a Palm Pilot complete with a stylus to "read" that someone has hacked the bridal shop computer. I didn't know this was possible using a database storage device. A woman appears in the film without any introduction and is never presented. We learn halfway in the film that this woman works in the district attorney's office. Then, in the correctional center, a guard actually PRECEDES Jenks through a door and holds his back to the culprit !! This would NEVER occur in a true corrective setting. The director really messed up this - this doesn't happen in real life. The acting is adequate. The plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, the numerous errors found in continuity lead to a vote out of 3 out of 10.
