First of all I just want to say that I LOVE this show !!! But this episode ... this episode makes a mockery of the whole show. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode, but they successfully created the Worst episode of the whole series. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... they suck. <br /> <br /> The way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game. .... For example "as the furlings seem" creating that stupid "previously on ..." ... it is simply embarrassing. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the writers are turning out of ideas and this is really too bad.
