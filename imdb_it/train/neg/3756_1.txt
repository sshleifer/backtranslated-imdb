It's really bad in a movie. My friend rented it because he, well, he's an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot also because I saw the whole damn thing! The actors were on a par with the high school geeks who think they're going. The only place to go is back at the waiting tables at Luby's. All I could think of while watching this "gem" was how it was actually made. I mean, some "scriptwriters" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then a fool with money believed so much in the script that he decided to cash in some money with the naive misunderstanding that he would make a return on it. The actors were chosen, the locations were scouted, the make-up artists were hired, the computer animators who had just left the Graphic Design School of Al Collins were introduced and this asshole started to take shape. <br /> <br /> There were obviously a lot of things I hated about this move, but the only thing that pushed me the most crazy was the excessive use of music. Every single minute of this film has been marked. There was not a single pause in the music. And sometimes it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you lose some fundamental points of the plot or something else. <br /> <br /> After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit, then switching to a BMW 740il. No other two films could be obtained in terms of quality.
