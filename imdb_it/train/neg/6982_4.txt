Wet tale of the American Revolution. <br /> <br /> When farmer Tom Dobb (Al Pacino) and his son arrive in the port of New York, they are immediately conscripted by the rascal Annie Lennox ... Annie Lennox? .. to contribute to the war effort. <br /> <br /> After being shot down by fragments of connecting chains shot by British cannons, Tom and his son are immediately punished by Continental Army sympathizer "Daisy" (Nastassja Kinski) for "not standing up" . After this moment of Kodak, there are a series of digressive chapters that include Tom's participation in a "fox hunt" in which he must bring a model of the "poor old Georgie Washington" filled with effigies as he runs to an English captain in possession handkerchief (Manning Redwood)), and barbecuing with a group of Iroquois Indians as they plan the best way to sneak back into the fighting so that Al and his ungrateful child can kick the ass of British officer Donald Sutherland . <br /> <br /> Director Hugh Hudson presents a unique style of film production and the atmosphere is as dense as the proverbial London fog, but the screenwriter painting of red jackets as evil monsters once again reveals patented hatred of Hollywood against the British. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as an enlisted American soldier.
