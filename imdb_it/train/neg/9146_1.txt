Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does, he should be arrested on the spot ... at least for minor theft. Anyone who pays even a penny to rent any of his rubbish should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first vision of his "work" ... and it will be the last. And Wood looks very good to me now. <br /> <br /> When I return this piece of shit to the video store, I will personally request that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am irritated and irritated by the fact that this deformed and extraordinarily talented man is allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a cute little boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, fortunately, has no other acting titles in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as a bait, to then market it as a movie rental. Trust me, this has no place in any rack; it is simply not a film in any sense of the word. The offensive and irresponsible garbage like this can only be detrimental to the efforts made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, homosexual rights in general!). For those who are tempted to rent it because of the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattering to watch on the film as he is on the cover, and appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, the welcoming Mroavich inflicts on us his disgusting, unpleasant and awkward nakedness. <br /> <br /> This "thing" that he "assembled" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, brings out such a shoddy garbage) are terrible at this. Mraovich expressly proposes himself as a complete non-talent (in all fields), in a desperate attempt to cling to any "loser" attention he can do for himself. He must be pitied.
