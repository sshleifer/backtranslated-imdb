Another cult strikes again. This is not a spoiler, because the REAL ending comes after researching the people who brought this too long, pseudo-scientific spot ... Ramtha's School of Enlightenment. <br /> <br /> When any religion / philosophy needs to hide behind a screen of deception similar to OZ, I'm leaving. Thanks to Ramtha I saw a borrowed copy of this film on the advice of a "friend" ... of having wasted precious resources on this New Age lobotomizer would have been tragic. I can only hope that they "truly believe they can walk on water" enough to take that guide to its "logical" conclusion ... in other words; walk, drown ... or shut up :-) As a film ... deserves a strong "1" on its entertainment value, especially to create the most unpleasant character in the history of cinema (the photographer's roommate ... eeeeeek!). If you have to watch this movie, borrow it from one of the brainwashed people who recommended it.
