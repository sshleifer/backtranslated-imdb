My comments on this film have been canceled twice, which I find rather offensive, since I am making an effort to judge this film for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches' works is not understood, so it completely changes my comment. <br /> <br /> I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons. <br /> <br /> Object: one should be very careful in making a film about a philosopher who even today is not understood by the masses and among peers highlights passionate discussions. One thing the philosophers agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about his life, which obviously includes his "ideas", is something that should be extremely cautious with, or preferably, not doing at all. Wisdom begins with the knowledge of what you do not know. You might think this is not a review of the film itself, but the film is not about an imaginary character, but about the life of someone who has lived and had / has a great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story of a tomato, I can express my thoughts on the story itself, but also on the chosen subject, the tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a film about real facts. Especially in a case like this and this responsibility has not been taken. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed was the ridiculous accents. Why? It distracts from what it should be; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It doesn't help to put things in a right geographical perspective or time! Come on, make the correct English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got it right ... letting his characters talk about an elusive Aramaic in the Passion. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is superimposed. <br /> <br /> 3d, Assante is not an actor to represent Nietzsche. Bad casting. <br /> <br /> 4, the facts are far away. <br /> <br /> And so on. It's a waste of celluloid.
