This film is the real disappointment of Tsai Ming-Liang for me. Emanates laziness from every frame. So I'm not going to analyze it thoroughly either. But some remarks: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why can we see urban landscapes with green trees in bloom? I wonder if this should have meant something in the metaphorical context of the film (where thirst notifies the lust for intimacy and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of bad film making, it doesn't give a damn about being coherent. <br /> <br /> 2. We don't know what happened to the porn actress, because she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a matter of no importance as long as the message of the supreme alienation is delivered successfully (= explosively), but in retrospect, its inert body turns out to be a cheap dramaturgical device, a pretext? equally free and exploited in the activity in which it is employed. <br /> <br /> 3. Is nothing expressed in this film that Antonioni did not express better 40 years ago ?? and without unnecessarily humiliating his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical numbers (recycled from "The Hole") seemed to be the idea of ​​an artistic counterpoint of a secondary school, performed on that level of secondary school ability. If this was the point, the point sucked.
