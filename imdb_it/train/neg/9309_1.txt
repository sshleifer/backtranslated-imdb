Hi everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this movie. The basic plot is that a boy (Brandon) takes some friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend vacation away from work. After picking up a girl there, things start to go very bad for them all. <br /> <br /> The plot alone (written by the actor who plays Brandon, I think, although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is executed accordingly. The "Clown Killer" is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious, but above all intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy fool who sings like a nursery rhyme that seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. The only thing that justified the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and all the blood in the film (the quality of the film led me to take pleasure in these things). <br /> <br /> In short, this film falls below any possible established standard. Of course, I was sharing some beers with a close friend while watching this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value from this movie and it's therefore fair to mention that S.I.C.K fell only for fear of a rating of two. However, in reality (in hindsight) one-star evaluation is a more than legitimate score for this film. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars.
