The script for this TV soap opera is so bad that even A. Hopkins at one point had to act as a theater student for undergraduates in order to bring some life into his character as a writer. I don't know if this was the director's purpose, but Hopkins Cyan has nothing but vanity, fear and lack of self-esteem. The real Ciano was perhaps all this but then, why shoot a film about him? Mussolini was a little more convincing, and his long descent was as if he were closer to the truth. Edda Mussolini was simply ridiculous (not because of Sarandon, but because of the helpless script), while he was to be the central character of this alleged family drama. Just watch it if you like the Venezuelan soap opera.
