I'm sick and tired of all these little things about how this movie was "shaken". It is pure CRAP over-act CRAP! Don't send an Assassin, it makes a lot more sense to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive and poisonous snakes on a plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to do it. It's not "so bad it's beautiful" It's so ugly that I'd rather be hit in the eye with a sharp stick, then be subject to this again. I honestly thought it would be a COMEDY as AIR! A parody! I was wrong. It's all "It sucks, take it!" O Samuel A. Jackson screams "Snakes on the Plane!, Well, sorry, I don't understand. It seems that a lot of idiots have given the film industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought the William Hung CD, still live in their basement mothers, and stink of sweat plastic chair for days on the computer playing online games and watching porn, then run to the theater and ask a ticket for Snakes on a stupid Plane. Fucking movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies, the true decline of Western civilization, calling it a cult films as an insult to true cult classics such as Repo man or even Orgazmo.
