Where do they get the money to make movies like this? I mean, there's nothing saving in this movie. None of the actors is known, the writing is terrible, the photograph is blurred, the story wanders between being a bad version of Repo Man and a nicklodeon western and acting is incredible. For someone watching all kinds of good and bad films, I have to admit that this film is the worst I've seen since Attack of the Eye People in the 1950s. I don't really like throwing away the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or, we miss you, art, but no one would like this movie. The story turns on a mystical contamination of a person who is a bad version of the Celtic soul eater, although it functions more like a male succubus without the sexual nuances. The bad guys have to work with the good guys in a city they can't escape from. Take it from there since, alas, it's the best part. My advice is that, unless you find yourself in a bad mythology, in amateur writing, in unconvincing acting and in a boring context, you'll be better served by leaving this on the shelf when you're out renting videos.
