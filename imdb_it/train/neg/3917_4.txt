"The house of the spirits" is rather horrible. I live in South America, in a country that has suffered a military dictatorship just like the one the film tries to describe, and even though everyone knows that films can be very far from reality, this film in particular considers viewers both ignorant and stupid . Things are not as simple and straightforward as they appear here, and obviously the political process is much more complicated and interesting than the plot in "The House ...". If you can't show that the complexity on the screen it's better not to make a film. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in cinema, without so many clich√©s. In some parts I have heard that Carmen Miranda may appear inside parrots and palms. When you talk about certain things you have to be not only attentive but respectful of the public's intelligence.
