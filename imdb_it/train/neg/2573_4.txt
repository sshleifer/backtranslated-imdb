If you have plenty of time to spare ... that's fine. It moves at a good pace, but to pull this film off it should be a little longer with a little more background on the subject. <br /> <br /> Acting is OK. Mariana Klaveno as the model does the best job and is the most credible. <br /> <br /> William R. Moses played a very positive role as her husband. <br /> <br /> Gail O'Grady, as his wife had a weak side and the reasons she returned to work were not developed. <br /> <br /> The ending is kind of a fool. Like most of these sitters movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but in general you wonder why you spent your time.
