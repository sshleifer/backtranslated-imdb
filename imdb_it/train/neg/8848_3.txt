Somewhere, buried very deep within this film, a decent halfway movie tries to get out. The only traces are some initial scenes in Los Angeles (in a bar and in a cemetery) and then a couple of production design pieces. As I said, very deeply buried. One of the biggest challenges faced by films involving the supernatural is how to have the characters react credibly in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace of the first movie) is (was?) A werewolf is, if I remember, along the lines of; "Oh really?". Not one of the best answers to that challenge. The non sequitri continue while the story moves to Trannsylvanialand in search of Stirba (the apparently self-appointed "Queen of werewolves"). Like Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the film. Yes, even better than the werewolf group sex scene, the acting of Reb Brown and the werewolf-looking clothes that look strangely like a werewolf. The credits have taken on a minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie makes the same amount of sense. If you happen to pick it up on American television, the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of Danning that tears off his shirt with another endlessly repeated shot of her tearing a cloak only this time when she a kind of top below. It's a kind of absurdity, a moment in which the icing on the cake challenges satire.
