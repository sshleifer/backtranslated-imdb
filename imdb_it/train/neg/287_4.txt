As an Altman fan, I've been looking for this film for years, thinking that with such an exceptional cast, it should have been at least marginally bright. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's mixtures with the great cast, thrown together haphazardly and suddenly (or so it seems) with the hope that everything would come together in the editing room. It does not do it. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is noteworthy only for Alfre Woodard's debut performance, which overshadows the veterinarians surrounding it. But apart from that, avoid at all costs. (Which is pretty easy to do - it was never released on video - as far as I know - and its cable appearances have the frequency of Halley's comet.)
