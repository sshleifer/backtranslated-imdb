Don't be deceived as I was by the "brilliant" reviews mentioned in the DVD package. "Wildly entertaining.", "A severely scary freakout.", And the worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This film is not among those above. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't care about writing bad reviews for movies, but I can't believe this is resting in a comfortable 7 on IMDb. He doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> After such an overwhelming daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this film is definitely not going anywhere and goes there sloooowly. Basically and unlikely, a girl is entangled by the monster (I will give them points for good creature design but this is not a WETA creation) and her semi-comic family spends an hour and a half tracking her down ... in the sewers that surround the Han river. Their search is suspense-free - again, did someone call him on par with Jaws? - and when they find it, you understand that it was practically useless. In addition to this, a large part of the film is engaged in a government quarantine that culminates in a funny scene involving a boy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. This was bad. I'm not kidding. Want to see a rotten monster movie? Deep Rising rental. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
