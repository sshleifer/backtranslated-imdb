"This could mean the end of the white race!" gasps a general as a dozen native zombies roam the European battlefields during the "Great War". An expedition leaves from the long-lost town of Kennif-Angor to stop this kind of thing and keep the battlefields clear so that honest and respectable whites will massacre at tens of thousands. <br /> <br /> It's a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this movie because the acting is so wooden. Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is very bad. From a previous decade. It looks like it came out of a matching textbook on "How to act" <br /> <br /> ------------- Chapter three: Emotions ------- - ---- <br /> <br /> "How to express fear and contempt (Female) Clench your fists, put your fist on your heart, open your mouth to scream, put another punch, palm , Hold the position for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable, then quickly rotate the head 90 degrees from the direction of the detested object and you cry ". <br /> <br /> "How to have a difficult scene, heavily loaded with emotion with the former boyfriend Explain your love for someone else, DO NOT make eye contact, don't move, show no emotion, don't move too much eyes as you read your lines from the study wall ". <br /> <br /> To give us a break from leaden acting the director cleverly cuts through the long pauses in which nothing happens except that the film continues to flow through the projectors. Then the 35-minute value of the story is completed for 60 minutes. <br /> <br /> The zombie revolt when it arrives is so slow! Freed from mental slavery, the armies of ex-zombiefed servants turn to their former master, slowly wandering up the hill and then stabbing the door a little and smashing a window. "Yes ... we seek ... oh, I dunnno yes. Let's take it. Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana." (Although I have just found some hidden symbolism, Jagger is struck by a native as a sort of ironic counterpoint to all the natives shot by the Germans at the beginning of the film. End of the White Race!) The pursuit (can call it that) through the swamp projected back is exhilarating and is worth only the admission price. Roy D'Arcy has plenty of time at the campsite, but he's completely wasted, like Col. Mazovia. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moment in this film. A beautiful montage of the zombised natives and members of the white cast who fall under the spell of evil eyes. face after face, crossfading into each other. It works, although there is a strange little blip in the middle of each foreground as if a frame had been cut. I imagine these must be the frames of Neg Cutters between the fades. <br /> <br /> Better to look at yourself with friends and in a silly state of mind.
