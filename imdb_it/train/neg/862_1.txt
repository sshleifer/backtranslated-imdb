'Succubus', the modified version of 'Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden', is a struggle to sit, even at a minute of 76 minutes; once again of this terrible boring and boring triple European of horror and I could have slipped into a coma. <br /> <br /> Jess Franco once again offers a truly terrible piece of '60s trash that seems to have been made by a cast and the outrageous crew for class A hallucinogens, since not even a second of this mess it made sense. Apparently, this is one of the best of his 180 movies? it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there. <br /> <br /> The unfathomable plot deals with the usual themes of Franco of sex, violence and lesbianism and throws a bit of S&M for good measure, yet it continues to work to remain mentally boring. <br /> <br /> Could I leave it a while before entering the world of twelve-year-old Euro Horror again? life is too short to be spent looking at the bilge like this.
