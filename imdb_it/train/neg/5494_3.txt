<br /> <br /> Inexpensive and ugly, this film does not even seem to entertain children in the audience, except for a rather funny bar joke. Christopher Lloyd is beyond his maximum and actually quite tired in this role, although the sorry excuse for writers' jokes doesn't help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateur in an apparently comedic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this film, especially since it is inevitable that we compare it to the often brilliant improvisations of Robin Williams in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
