Really, really bad. How do you make such a bad movie? I kept waiting for some points in the plot to save me, an interesting photographic work, or at least some free nudity, but I got nothing. I had just seen Cabin Fever and thought it was a train disaster (except for nudity and pancakes) but it seems like a genius comparable to this disaster. The best writer in the world could not have saved this putrid pile of stinky poop. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's happening for this "movie" is that it's over. <br /> <br /> I have a headache just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. Ugh! I'm glad I paid only $ 5 for this and will soon end up in a landfill.
