This thing is horrible. The character of Ben Affleck is egocentric and sadly sadistic: the punch-you-in-the-nose sadist. And he's the romantic HERO! His cartoon character doesn't change from beginning to end, but his money allows him to buy happiness. <br /> <br /> If I were a socialist, I would have incredibly massacred, but I'm not a socialist. <br /> <br /> We capitalists like to have a little Christmas magic from time to time. This is not magic. I don't know what it is. It's just awful. And it's a horrible waste of talent. O'Hara has made me laugh hysterically since the late 1970s. Gandolfini. Applegate. These people were all underused. If Ben was out of the equation, these people could have come up with something excellent.
