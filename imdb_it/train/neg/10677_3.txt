I rented End Game, I've never heard of it, but I like crime thrillers so I thought I'd give it a chance. After doing some research on the film, I discovered that it was originally intended for release in movie theaters, but that it had gone to DVD instead. After seeing it, I'm thinking "no wonder". The film is shocking in its originality. The plot and the characters are superficial. I realized that the score was halfway, but the finish was a curve ball. I must say that I did not expect it to end as it happened, but it is not a point in its favor. The most predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad. Maybe the directors saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to make a change - even the one that made the film even worse. <br /> <br /> Stay away. I want the $ 5.98 back and my 107 minutes.
