Screenwriter Lisa Lutz started writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /> <br /> Are you still in business? If someone gave you another chance after this piece of shit, you are looking for the luckiest Person of Ever award. This movie sucks at END ... It never ceases to amaze me what it turns into a movie ... .and the fact that they did postpone this writer for a while? Seriously? I can write a better shit than this in my sleep. <br /> <br /> OK, so how many lines do I have to type? I don't understand at all. I guess I'm a beginner, I guess I don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what someone has to say ... or a quota? Seriously, I don't care if you have a sentence of a word ... or even a single answer: I mean, shall we go? <br /> <br /> Thanks ... is it enough, finally? <br /> <br /> This film is worthless.
