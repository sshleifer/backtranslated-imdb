It was interesting to see how accurate was the writing on geek words, but very naive in the corporate world. The Justice Department would catch the giants of the big corporation more if they did such naive things to win. The real world of business is much more subtle and interesting, yet just as sinister. I seriously doubt that ANY organism would kill someone directly; even the mod is more indirect in these days. In the real world they kill people with nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film must have been developed by some garage geeks, I think, and the studios didn't know the difference. They just wanted something to capitalize on Microsoft's antitrust case in the news.
