Roy Rogers plays Jesse James and his double, gambler Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is the former friend of Mr. Rogers, sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a noteworthy team, like two reporters looking for stories about the fugitive outlaw hero. <br /> <br /> Of course, the mistaken identity / impersonation is a developmental plot, since Rogers wages a "dual role". Rogers is charming, as usual; but, there is nothing that can really elevate this performance above the ordinary - any potential to offer a memorable performance of Jekyll / Hyde is done by poor material. The best couple to watch are Mrs Storm and Mrs Paye as the reporter for the St. Louis Journal: they are the highlight of the film. The songs are fine, even if badly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
