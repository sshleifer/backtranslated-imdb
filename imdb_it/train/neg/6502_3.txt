Given the possibility of writing, directing and acting in my film, I would probably choose something about robotic women with guns. Anthony Hopkins, however, has decided to make the strangest film anyone has ever seen. "Slipstream" is such a strange film that even David Lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say "What's going on?" <br /> <br /> This is a film in which, in one scene, a man crosses the road to a yellow car facing right that suddenly turns into a pink car facing left. This is a film in which two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of casual people laughing and insects climbing on the walls. This is a movie in which a man starts talking about "Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers" just because the actor of that particular movie suddenly shows himself as himself (and then disappears into nothingness). <br /> <br /> This is a film that decides to launch the need for a coherent plot directly from the window and to use fifteen different modifications while doing it, in addition to switching from black and white to color for seemingly no reason anyway. I must, however, praise Mr. Hopkins for his choice of actors in this film (some of whom portray more characters). Everyone involved gets into their roles, even though they probably have no idea what they're actually doing. My favorite here was the Christian Slater thug with a hat that was impressively threatening while he stuttered senseless and sang the American national anthem. <br /> <br /> Anthony Hopkins was quoted as saying that he made this film a joke and is perhaps the best way to summarize "Slipstream". It's a joke on the public. You will look at it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is happening and hoping the answer will come, only to find that the answer never does. What's the final joke of this particular joke, only Anthony Hopkins will ever know. <br /> <br /> I've already talked about David Lynch and I'm a big fan of that particular director. I would say that Anthony Hopkins shares my love for characters like "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as satisfying as any of Lynch's films despite having imitated many of his techniques (although I was surprised to find that nobody is talking backwards in "Slipstream"). It's too chaotic and casual - as another reviewer pointed out, it's the film version of Alzheimer's disease. No doubt there are a small number out there that I can look at and draw something from it. Unfortunately for the rest of us, "Slipstream" quickly becomes a dull and confusing experience that was only made because of Hopkins' involvement. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
