I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie movies to watch the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be trivial, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. So I don't expect much. But he should at least have a story. Stories don't cost anything except time ..... apparently, they haven't even had time. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies appeared near the end of the film looked like new wave whores. The image of the zombie on the cover NEVER appears in the film. It was absolutely distressing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> The execution time is only 81 minutes, but it seemed like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only listen to the movie since she was at the computer in another room), she looked like a zombie porn ... which if you think about it seems a bit disgusting ... but that wasn't good. <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that perhaps the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an inconsistent mess. <br /> <br /> It ended up being a free rental and I still feel robbed. I evaluated 1 of 10 because IMDb does not allow me to use decimals.
