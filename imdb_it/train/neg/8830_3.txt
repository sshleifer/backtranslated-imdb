Just too many holes in this movie to be funny AND IT'S ALL A bizarre, almost Hollywood end that is completely out of context with the rest of the movie (it's not a spoiler like you'll never guess how it ends!) <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it will be necessary to have a thick skin for every politically correct nuance. The conflict between whites and blacks was highly invented and unilateral. I didn't understand why the author had the local black community behaved in such an unacceptable way, was he trying to be racist? <br /> <br /> A truly Byzantine film. Just look if you like being really bothered by holes in the plot and you like to discuss all the things that might or shouldn't have happened. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, shooting and acting are excellent.
