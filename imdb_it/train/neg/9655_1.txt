I ended up watching this movie before going through any review at the request of a female. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I'm quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site that let me conclude that it's a scam. <br /> <br /> As for my opinion, I have to ask, "are these filmmakers retarded or do they presume viewers are retarded?" The film is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or the presentation. <br /> <br /> So, this group of boys plus a girl (the lead actress) form a musical band; assuming the constant presence of guitars should be a ROCK band. Hell, when did the dancers start becoming part of a rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as the version of a Bollywood rock band, but funny enough all the scores that made these two guitarists to do all kinds of "ROCK GESTURES" and I suppose they were playing instruments, the guitar sound was completely missing !!! I simply cannot understand the magnitude of the stupidity here .... <br /> <br /> I am about to conclude here because it is not worth underlining further defects in the film. The Bollywood directors seem to have no more shame !!!!!!!!
