I was thirteen when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16 in Germany, I entered the film as a fallback. It was so boring. Later I realized that this was just crap in which a husband shows his wife. I mean today you do it via the internet and pay for immediate access. It's more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I dwell on this movie. This is a soft-porn for schoolchildren. Undress Bo Derek and paint it with colors - nice. But then they should name the film Undressing Bo and paint it.
