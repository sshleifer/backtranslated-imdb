The plot is so manipulative, that it relies completely on the most inaccessible and unthinkable decisions of adults in any parental decision. The children are super about the charm and the delivery of the lines but, as I said, the whole plot depends on the fact that every adult is a complete idiot, and therefore, in this case, makes more sense from his actions (and at the same time it is the only way to explain the actions of children of total distrust). Why do sweey adorable little boys take a baby from the shore? How did the child reach the shore and at the same time make it the LAST place to look? Why on earth will the 2 boys NEVER be informed and instead at the same time as missing a child no one makes a fig about them around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally in every other place where they searched? There is no possible justification for asking the public to believe it. Asking to believe that he would then do a trial (even the informal setting) is too offensive to be discovered.
