OK, but does that make it a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. There is not much to recommend it. I found it very slow, boring, in fact, even this is predictable practically through and through number one and two were somehow predictable, but not so predictable. I also felt that sometimes this movie was rather campy, I didn't think it was suitable for this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the villain in this episode. He's a pretty decent actor, but I heard he played his character too much over the top. I guess it fits the tone of the film, which would have been great if I liked the film.plus, there were some rather ugly coatings. Arnold Vosloo returns to the title role, but in this film he is not given much work. The character didn't really evolve, as I had hoped. Oh well. This is just my opinion. However, for me, while this movie is not abysmal, it's pretty ugly. My vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
