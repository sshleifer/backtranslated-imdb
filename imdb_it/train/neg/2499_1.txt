The cast of this film contains some of the best New Zealand actors, many of whom I've seen in fabulous roles, but this film fills me with shame because it's from the same nation as them. False American accents are the first clue that things are going to be spectacularly wrong. As another rather cleverly-known review, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, decorated with some of the multi-colored flags stolen from a batch of used cars. Most of the cast seems to come from the (big) New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. It is as if this film had been imagined at a Shortland Street Christmas party, the result of too many gins and maybe some salmon. Imagine "Under Siege" meets "The Love Boat", staged by your local elementary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor, I suggest you see this film as a study on how to destroy your companion.
