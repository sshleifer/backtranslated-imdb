I saw "Rachel's Attic", thinking that I would be on a pleasantly visceral ride. However, it was not the case. Visceral, yes, but pleasant? It would be a big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I gave a "3" is because Gunnar Hansen appears (albeit briefly) as one of the film's reprehensible characters. How they ever attracted Mr. Hansen to this piece of ... work, I'll never know. The idea of ​​history is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. The only thing that is worse than that, are the special effects. YIKES !!! I saw better effects in a school play. Forget it, Mr. W, it's time for a career change ... I hear they're hiring Mel's Diner! There are very few, well-made Indian films coming out of Michigan ... and "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
