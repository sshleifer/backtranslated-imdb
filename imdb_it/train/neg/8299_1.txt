A Christmas story is a classic holiday and my favorite movie. So, of course, I was thrilled when this movie came out in 1994. I saw it on the opening day and was prepared to enjoy it. I was disgusted and digossed. The anticipation unleashed by a Christmas story has curiously disappeared from this mess. A Red Ryder BB Gun is better to have a Chinese top. And it's not funny at all. Charles Grodin is good but the dollar stops there. Bottom Line: 1 star. Don't even bother.
