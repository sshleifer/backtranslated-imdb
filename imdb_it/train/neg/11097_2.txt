This is exactly the kind of Saturday matinee series I loved during World War II. I was less than ten years old. And this is the audience for whom this serial is designed. Looking at him now, one must roar at his ineptitude and stupidity. The budget must have been almost nil, given the shortcuts and repetitions. The acting? Well, this is the photo of the Republic, from 1944. They read the lines ... and without a doubt they had a chance to make them convincing. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars.
