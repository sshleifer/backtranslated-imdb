POSSIBLE SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The spy who fucked me is a much overrated and overwhelmed sequel. International Man of Mystery came immediately from the blue. He was a lone star that few people had heard of. But it was extraordinarily original, it had a sophisticated humor and a wide humor, always kept in good taste and had a brilliant cast. The Spy Who Shagged Me was advertised and publicized much more publicly. <br /> <br /> Ok, I admit, the first time I saw this movie I thought it was a lot of fun, but it's only after seeing it two or three times that you see all the flaws. The acting was OK, but Heather Graham can't act. His performance did not seem very convincing and was not as close as Liz Hurley was in the first. Those characters who bloomed in the first, (Scott Evil, Number 2 etc.) are thrown in the background to listen and not get many autonomous scenes. The film is simply invaded by cameos. <br /> <br /> In particular, I hated the way they totally ignored some IMOM scenes. When they killed Vanessa at first and Basil sat down, he knew she was a fembot all the time. What was the point of this? They killed the number 2 in the first, and now they report it without explanation. This should be a spy, I don't think any of the characters even have a gun in the movie. It's just a trace, further and further from the point. <br /> <br /> The new characters are very unwelcome. The whole Mini-Me skirmish "make fun of my size" ages very quickly. Fat Bastard is just a bad excuse for gross humor. In total there are about two or three good jokes. The rest is tasteless or repainted by IMOM. <br /> <br /> If this were the first movie in the series, I'd probably be easier. But the series began with a note of dry humor and then collapsed to a level of coarse humor. So I say, watch this movie only if you haven't seen its predecessor, because The Spy Who Shagged Me is one last disappointment.
