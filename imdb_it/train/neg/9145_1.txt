Let me first say that I like watching "bad" movies. It is strange how some of these films have a longer lasting impression than the truly superb ones. This film is badly creepy. This vehicle for the delirious ego of Sam Mraovich does not limit itself to avoiding the ineptitude without talent, but has redefined the very meaning of the words. This should forever be the barometer of bad movies. A sort of Mendoza line for films. Mr. Mraovich writes, directs and interprets the blunt object Arthur Sailes who fights against despised wives and evil Christian forces while he and his companion Ben "die behind the eyes". The factions fight for marital equality. As a libertarian, I believe gays should have the right to marry. Ben & Arthur do more harm to that cause than a homophobic army. The portrait of all things Christian is so ugly and fierce, Mraovich's trademark, that you can't take them seriously. Arthur's brother, Victor, the bible that jokes to Jesus, is so horribly exaggerated, wicked / effeminately gay that you have to ask yourself how he was chosen to play this role. This is because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also casting director. The worst of all is Sam Mraovich himself. When do you think the main man brings to mind the words mushy, bald and chubby? Sam also offers lines like domino pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final count: you suck in writing, directing, acting and casting. This is Ed Wood's quadruple crown. Congratulations, horrible little man.
