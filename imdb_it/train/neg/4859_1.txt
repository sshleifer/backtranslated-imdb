You must admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, guidance and enthusiasm when it comes to films: between 1985 and 2000 he made 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is something to do, it's probably all shit (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to confirm my impression). <br /> <br /> Part 3 sees a group of hideous students who find the detention a little more eventful than usual after being attacked by hordes of living dead, who have fled from a top army base secret located directly below their school. Working from a terrible screenplay by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on the liberal use of the atom bomb), director Sheets offers yet another embarrassing amateur effort with some incredible cast performances without talent, terrible visual effects (a bit of shit) CGI and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard spaceship) and its trademark of poor blood (a handful of offal pulled from under the clothes of its victims). <br /> <br /> Finally, after what seems like an eternity that looks irritating to characters running through their lives, and unconvincing undead people caressing animal innards, Zombie Armageddon ends with a time-travel ending / paradox that forces viewers to review several tortuous minutes since the beginning of the film. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets, what did we do to deserve to have to look at it again?
