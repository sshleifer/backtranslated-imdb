This film has some fatal flaws in it, as someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is incredible. So this same person walks around the structure and enters the doctor's office, it's just bad writing or bad modification. <br /> <br /> Very, very, very predictable movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this film was made, except that it was shot in Canada and probably received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I must say that the person who plays Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job. <br /> <br /> Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television, then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it's a movie that no actor would want on the own curriculum.
