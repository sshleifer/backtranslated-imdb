I don't know much about cinema, but good movies have to tell a sort of story ... your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they can, but not satisfactorily, and I don't mean a happy ending, just ANY end. <br /> <br /> Last outing in Brooklyn, set in Brooklyn in 1952 during a brutal work strike, it sets in motion a series of stories. Most involve some of the most unlikely characters that can ever cross a movie screen. But Last Exit to Brooklyn fails to complete these stories ... it leaves some of them hanging endlessly, or explodes into a bizarre stratosphere for an "artistic" ending. <br /> <br /> Two cases to the point, and contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad disguised character (an important character in the film) is hit by a car and killed. And that's all for him in the movie .... it's gone forever, erased from everyone's memory ... no reaction from his friends, enemies, lovers ... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread the stupid, clueless and secretly gay strike leader, having been pushed back from work, his gay lover, and discovered by the neighborhood thugs, is trampled by thugs. The final scene of the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of the Nazi death camps ... and the scene drags on and on and on ... and the camera goes off on the body of the labor leader, and was crucified ..... ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course this is all for him too .... brain wipe ..... gone. <br /> <br /> Bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this movie ... This movie is a depressing piece of mud. Avoid it. And if I don't warn you, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality ... don't let the boys look.
