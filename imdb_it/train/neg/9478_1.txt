If there had been any strange Oscar Academy festivals, this film would have won it all. It has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects coupled with excellent acting skills and, of course, in every role there is a celebrity superstar. Well, this could be the scenario if the world were reversed, but it is not. Instead it is the worst horror film ever made, not just the bad actors who seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with negative dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. For example, the devil costume (which by the way is a must see) is one of the most exhilarating things I've ever seen. Whenever I saw that red-black monster so called on the screen, I couldn't hold back my laughter. And moreover it seemed that the strange creature was carried by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake as me. The control of IMDB, given that the film was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thought, "Well, it's worth shooting, it can't be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes, it could. <Br /> <br /> I'm not going to waste more words in this movie.
