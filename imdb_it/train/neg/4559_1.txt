I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series would actually accept responsibility. The script is so funny that it must have been written by someone who failed the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union entrance exam (and this is saying something!). Take out the binoculars if you want, but there's nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been broke to belittle himself with this garbage. The rest of the cast are so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic skill, I'm amazed it's lasted beyond the first episode - correction, beyond the auditions. All I can say to those who have fun is that they must be easily entertained. And it is obvious that the production costs must all have been â‚¤ 100 per episode. And in case anyone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I am really English.
