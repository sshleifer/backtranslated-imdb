Some people have pledged to dissert this film because they question the plausibility of blacks in the old West, the old West Asians or the women with guns in the Old West period. Take a hold and read a book. There were several Asians (Chinese), there were several blacks (freedmen) and everyone outside the gentile class had immediate access to weapons; is the second amendment you know. And as for the use of modern language, none of these Westerners expressed nostalgia for the language actually used which was consistent with the epoch represented. The Americans had different accents, they used different pushups, they spoke at a very different pace and used a lot of words and phrases that today would be unrecognizable. Don't blame the historical inaccuracy for the fact that you haven't just dug it. To be honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you're seeing.
