A man brings his new wife to his home where his ex-wife died of an "accident". His new wife has just been released from an institution and is also VERY rich! Suddenly he begins to hear noises and sees skulls everywhere. Is he going crazy again or is he the first wife who returns from the dead? <br /> <br /> You probably guessed the ending, so I won't say it. I saw it many times Saturday afternoon as a child's TV. I liked it then, but I was young. Seeing it now I realize how ugly it is. It is played so horribly, badly written, very boring (even an hour) and has a huge cast of FIVE people (one of which is the director)! However it has some positive things about it. <br /> <br /> The music is rather terrifying and the setting with the large empty house and the nearby pond is pleasantly suggestive. There are also some scary moments (I skipped a little when he saw the first skull) and a rather effective ending. All in all it is definitely NOT a good movie ... but not even a total disaster. He has a small cult following. I give him a 2. <br /> <br /> Also try to avoid the Elite Drive-in DVD edition (it's paired with "Attack of the Giant Leeches"). It is TERRIBLE with jumps and scratches everywhere. It didn't even look so bad on TV!
