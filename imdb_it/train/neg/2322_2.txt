I searched everywhere for the video store to find this film, being the huge fan of elvis that I am, and I found a huge disappointment. Kurt Russel had most of the "elvis move" at the bottom and the imitation of the voice was great, but the dubbed voice of Elvis didn't work for me. the voice did not always match Russel's mouth, and it was difficult for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was obvious. Also, there have been so many discrepancies in the film, people who don't know much about elvis would probably consider them facts. the songs are sung by him before he recorded them in real life, the moment he got his first guitar is wrong, I'm sure his brother Jesse Garron was buried in an anonymous tomb, not one with a huge tombstone that reads JESSE GARRON. I know it was just a TV movie, but they missed important events, like the special of the return, and they dragged some scenes too long. if you want to see a good movie showing Elvis in his first rent, WHICH IS THE WAY, or another Elvis concert. listening to and seeing the true elvis preform is the only way to really see his talent. (brilliant statement, I know, but anyway ... I go out and rent a good elvis flic.)
