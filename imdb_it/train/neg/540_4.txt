ALL FOR LOVE (as it was titled when it was broadcast over the weekend) is a romantic drama set with Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon's army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland, where he meets and falls in love with a young girl visiting the prison. There is also a plot involving a murder. <br /> <br /> I will be honest and confess that I have not been too busy with the film since I am not a big fan of vintage dramas and the script seems a bit episodic, but I will say that this is well played by all involved and has a talented cast that sees Miranda Richardson, Anna Friel, Richard E Grant, Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs. Even the design of the costume you can expect is excellent <br /> <br /> I will be very surprised if this film will have no complaint after being broadcast on BBC2 at tea time. Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute in which a nipple is completely exposed and there is a scene of French prisoners taking a bath which includes all the male frontal nudity not to mention a murder scene in which one sees clearly the blood. You should really worry if the BBC schedulers have any clues about what they're doing
