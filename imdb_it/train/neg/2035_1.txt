I've learned about Zodiac for four years. And I'm not saying that I know much more than anyone else ... in fact, for most people who know and read and learn about Z, I'm the one who has the least knowledge ... But I know or at least I think I knowing that most things in this would not happen ... From how he signed his name ... to how he killed people ... I thought the Godfather was the worst movie ever ... <br /> <br /> The cinematography was that of a five-year-old ... not saying that my films are better, but I am not one who is making films for the mass population ... <br /> <br /> The acting that I thought for the most part was pretty good, I really did ... the main character didn't talk so much on camera or for nothing I forget and I don't know because I stopped watching ... his voice over to where it goes ... <br /> <br /> But really spend the four dollars and 70 cents on something else ... like a big pizza or something like that ... <br /> <br /> Until I learn to write a review, Psycho Phil
