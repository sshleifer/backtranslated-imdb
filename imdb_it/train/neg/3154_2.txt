Look, there's nothing spectacular offensive about this movie, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see before you've seen as much as the trailer. The main difference is that the Rom-com classics face their stories with wit and lack of pretensions. This film has no pretensions but in reality it has no sense of movement, you feel as if you could get up and leave at any moment. The film's production also has the feeling of a debut film made about fifteen years ago. I would recommend reviewing a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this superficial imitation. Oh, another BIG problem ... no chemistry. If you are used to seeing Michael that looks as cute as Vaughn in Alias, you will be seriously disappointed with the way they made him appear here.
