This film has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately it has no plot. To have a plot there must be a conflict. This film has not had any. He spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and never managed to put any activity into it. The photos seem to be artistic but fail to pay attention to the fundamentals of the story. <br /> <br /> If you love the Montana scenery and fly fishing, you will find some value in this film, you simply don't expect a story. There is not one.
