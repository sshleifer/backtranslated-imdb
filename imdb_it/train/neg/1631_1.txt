Please humiliate me if you do, for a minute while I read you the back of the box VHS ALLEY CAT. He says that: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city every street is a dead end - in every corner something to buy - in every alley another way to die - To survive you have to be the best - Just like Alley Cat Alley Cat: this lady owns the night. In the streets where even predators become victims, you know how to survive. Cross it and you have no more luck. Alley Cat - This animal is excited. <br /> <br /> Now isn't it one of the most pathetic blurb I've ever heard in your life? Anyone who has written must be crazy if he thought that such a horrible description could lead us to watch the video. Yet, unfortunately, any faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of English he was doing his job too well .. the film in the small plastic case is as bad as it sounds, and then a little. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the lead role, and the script basically tells her during each scene to o) Pout like a goldfish b) Kick kick or c) Show her female "attributes". No complaints about the latter, but in terms of the other two ... let's say she's not a great actress, and she's even less convincing as a martial arts expert. But even Meryl Streep with the body of Cynthia Rothrock (what a terrifying thought) could not have saved this film. The unfolding of the plot is boring beyond all imagination, since we get an inept and correct combat sequence after a sufficient pause, stopping only for hysterical court cheating and occasional love scenes induced by the gag with the interesting Robert Torti. Even the work with the video camera follows a similar path of shame, with plenty of too many close-ups and excessive continuity errors. <br /> <br /> The part that I really think summarizes this bucket of a movie is where our heroine is sexually assaulted and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rapist full of kids keeps them reluctantly from box. Not only can she escape despite overwhelming evidence against him, but she herself is then imprisoned for daring to protest the verdict before her honor. Behind the bars, he then has a group shower, a lesbian crush, a couple of cat battles and a nice sweaty volleyball game before being released on bail to continue his battle. This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the film, and the script stops until it is understood. I can only imagine that the producers wanted to add a little more of T & A to the mix, and invent this useless sub-plot as a means to reach that end. <br /> <br /> What kind of begs the question, is this an exploitative film or a serious drama? Nor, is my answer to this .. it is not shabby or camp enough to please Troma-style movie fans, and it certainly does not make the grade an exploration of a woman's struggle against the system .. simply because it is so frighteningly done. So who would want to see it? Moody, I suppose .. or IMDb reviewers who stay until 3pm and watch the old rubbish on the box as they try to fall asleep. Unfortunately on this occasional I failed, and the horrors will remain with me for quite some time. Don't make the same mistake I made. Have a hot milk, or something like that. 1/10
