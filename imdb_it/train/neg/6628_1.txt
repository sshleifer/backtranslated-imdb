If the scale became negative I would be happier. Seeing Sushmita Sen was beautiful, and Nisha Kothari has a bright future, but the producer and director have ruined every fun in this story. The choice of angles, the choice of enlightenment and all that is distracted from trying to remember what the story is. Oh, if the songs and the dances didn't make you rip your ears off your head first. The film could have been made twice at 1.25 hours, and it was quite good, a bit like "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer did not go in that direction, even if the "citizens" finally found their backbone and they want to help. This film has failed on so many levels: editing, writing, corners of photography, style, lighting, script name, any aspect of this film - it was BAD - probably even the food from the catering service was bad. I have never seen in six years watching Indian films (Bollywood) something badly done.
