Are you aware of that hilarious feeling you get when you watch a movie that is trying so hard to be a serious and inspiring piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but burst out laughing at the pure and terrible nature of the garbage that dirty your screen? "House of the Dead" struggles to reach even this low cinema level. <br /> <br /> From start to finish "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling of how you just woke up to discover that the cat has neatly arranged its curl on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the outset that female actors were chosen for their neckline size (which they shamelessly exploit) while males for their "ass" attitude. I honestly didn't care about any of the characters for any time in the movie and found myself really wanting their end to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered the two-hour showing of footage from the real game as a movie. At least then we will have a better acting ?? However, not everyone can blame the actors, since it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film in front of the script of this film. It's probably the worst part of the movie and actually contains lines like "These are zombies, plain and simple" and "No cap'n, we don't have to go there! It's evil!" <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies will never be particularly stimulating or meaningful; at best they are harmless two hours of action, blood and terror of the wardrobe. Trash, yes, but fun garbage. Not the kind of garbage that comes out of your garbage bag as you drag it across the room and smears your shoes with acid milk cartons and rotting banana skins. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" has received such negative reviews that no Danish cinema has bought the film. If only we could have had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
