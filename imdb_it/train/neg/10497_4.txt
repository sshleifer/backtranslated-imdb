So, Steve Irwin. You must admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that is clearly full of crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of reptile poop and the mud mentioned above, not only daily but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make me want to do it, but he managed to get his wife closer. <br /> <br /> This film is not part of my parallel universe of film category: films for people who have just had their teeth perforated, have a headache, or have no cinematic experience and therefore as quiet mediocrity ( currently well populated by Disney movies). It's too loud Well, Steve is too loud. He is so happy all the time, and he would cut off the blas√© teenager (I feel it now: "that movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I would say that his enthusiasm is taking hold, but if it were, I would be the owner of a room full of snakes, and this has not happened yet. I agree that they are beauties, but I have no intention of caressing them. <br /> <br /> The plot was really predictable. The bad guys were so bad, for a minute I thought I was shopping in an electronic consumer hypermarket. But the film was full of animals, and Steve and Terri, which is why I saw it. That plot (if I could call it that) was really more a reason to launch another croc in a truck. My expectations were low and I stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I was hoping, however, that there would be a bit of a sequel, in which Steve and Terri (after working on their acting skills) have a film with real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve again. I hope Terri and the children continue to get involved in the Australian zoo and the discovery channel, at least. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me how wonderful that crocodile is. Wow!
