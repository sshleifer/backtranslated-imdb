This movie is bad. I don't mean just "bad" as in; "Oh the script was bad", or; "The acting in that scene was ugly" ... I mean badly like in someone who should be held criminally responsible for putting this dumb pile of steaming stuff on an unsuspecting public. I will not even make him dignified with an explanation of (Plot ??) if I can refer to this. I can only think of another opportunity in about 40 years of films that I found the need to vent my spleen in a film. I mean, after all, nobody intentionally goes out to make a bad movie, right? Well ... yes. Apparently they do ... and the culprit is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! To be informed. Leave this shit where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, collecting dust.
