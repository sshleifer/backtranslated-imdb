When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, score! I admit, I was looking forward to seeing the film. And I must say that the first fifteen minutes were somehow nostalgic. Then it all went down the hill. I didn't expect it to be a politically correct mumbo jumbo dump on civil rights. They took every possible controversial topic and threw it into a stupid story. I was shocked that Noah was involved in something like that, especially in his role. No one with a fully functioning brain would really accept all that shit about the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know how communism was, sit down and read a book about it. And not one who praises it or is against it, only the cold and hard facts. <br /> <br /> I only saw a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. The rest of this film irritated me.
