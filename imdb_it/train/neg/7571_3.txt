The woman (Miriam Hopkins in the Virginia shoes) chases the man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) for his father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants to convince the man to invest some of his deceased mother's money in his father's business; but, the father is famous for losing money on braided hair patterns. No one knows, but the real evil intrigues are Man's best friends to steal his fortune ... <br /> <br /> The production seems engaging, but the story fails to get involved. Players do not play well drunk. Remarkable as Broderick Crawford's first appearance - as gopher "Hunk"; in addition to running errands, Mr. Crawford is nailed to the floor by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Woman Chases Man (04/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
