Let's go to the point: this film is a softcore pornography marketed for the masses with a name that the studio is milking to the last penny from the American teat. Period. <br /> <br /> The entire plot (and this should not imply that there is much to do) serves as a vehicle to show the public more tits and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween guy and you're too fussy about buying real porn, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the film doesn't have much to offer at all. <br /> <br /> The acting is sub-par, the character development is practically non-existent, and the story is a nostril without sense of nudity, binge drinking and jokes (none of which is particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Go buy a real porn if that's what you want to see, and if not, go see a GOOD movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are all great films, and all contain heavy use of alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "It's not how much, it's how you use it"
