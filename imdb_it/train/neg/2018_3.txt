Don't get me wrong, this is a terrible movie, clich√©, but it's a joy for Olivia Hussey fans - perhaps the most intoxicating beauty that has ever graced the big screen. A poster stated that it was unpleasant to look at - I wonder how her ideal woman is - Paris Hil-slut? Blockbuster should really establish a sub-genre for this type of film, since the Fatal Attraction plot has become a genre in its own right. When will Blockbuster adopt the "Adultry" section? It will fit well enough between the drama and the action sections, right? This film revolves around Olivia Hussey, who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may have killed his ex-wife, who looks a lot like Mrs. Hussey. This not-so-good proceeds to chase Olivia and thus make his life a living hell. I like Olivia Hussey, but I have no sympathy for the characters in the films that betray their spouses, so I wasn't really rooting for Olivia to come out of this skunk. <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$ (There is a smattering of violence in the film: Don Murray and Anthony John Denison are involved in a brawl when Denison says he will not stop seeing Olivia, Murray's wife, because she's just too beautiful in bed, a shooter and could get to squeeze a round - I'll let you watch). <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Olivia is the queen of short nudity and supplies a little here. She has a love scene with Anthony John Denison and also has a downpour scene - shot from a distance). <br /> <br /> STORY: $ (We have seen this plot before - a hundred times, and often done much better. guilty, while trying to decipher why this film was a real disaster, there is William Riead, the whose dialogue is rather sophisticated and reckless: the man has no narrative skills and is unable to construct vile human reactions to the plot These people, from the upper reaches of society, speak like middle school boys - with the habit of sleeping during the English lessons I entered Riead in the Never-to-be-seen-Again list. <br /> <br /> ACTING: $$$ (The acting was not "called" as the experts say, but has been hampered Olivia Hussey plays an important role in Riead's youth script and calls Anthony Jonh Denison "strange" and "crazy" on his face when he starts haunting Hussey, who is still beautiful, offers the best performance here, but Denison is was the same as the task of portraying a mad stal ker mad with love, Don Murray was basically there - his character was not enriched, and Edward Asner, a terrifying actor when given something with substance, is badly used in this film).
