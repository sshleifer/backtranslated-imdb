Oh dear, oh dear. I started looking at it without knowing what to expect. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There were moments when I thought it was a comedy. I loved the way the government's plan to capture the terrorist leader is to make the air fall into a man, who is unarmed, and expects him to catch him and escape with a missile. If only it were really that easy. Finally I found a worse movie than "Plan 9 From Outer Space".
