When I chose this film for the first time, I was fascinated by the basic idea and eager to see what would happen. I'm a fan of animation and I love it when it blends successfully with live action footage. However, the animation of this film concerned everything I liked. Although it must be said that the actors' performances were excellent. The visual aspect, including the animation, gave the piece a wonderfully disturbing air. However, this was the quality of the discomfort that was lost among the exaggerated images, both visual and in the script, which were practically tortured above the head. The most annoying thing was the relative lack of importance for the plot. It seemed that the plot was a shoe framed at irregular intervals giving a stuttering effect that distracted massively from the flow of the piece. Felisberto's voiceover - especially the one at the end - seemed very much a desperate attempt to fill holes in the plot that had been ignored in favor of secondary issues like the whole ant business (and even that wasn't properly addressed). I'm afraid the whole piece came out at best as a "reasonable first attempt" by a teenager who spent too much time reading DH Lawrence. It's not what you expect from seasoned filmmakers.
