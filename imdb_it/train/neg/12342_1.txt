Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a surly bastard from time to time. There are many films that I don't like and, for some unfathomable reason, I felt the urge to see again. However, if anyone out there is curious about the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without a doubt, this takes the title of the no of all time. 1 horrible movie. I can't believe I did it from the beginning of this clunker to the finish! <br /> <br /> It is clearly intended to capture the taste of Mel Brooks's young Frankenstein, but where that film was a fun catch on horror film traditions, this is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to crush the laughter embarrassing material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed to be here as a couple of journalists in today's Transylvania (perhaps they realized right away that they were doomed in this fool). During their search, they come across all the main monsters of previous favorite horror films, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can challenge this film to the end can pray that an interest be guided through their heart to free them from the agony of boredom. It marks a career point of view for all those involved and shows that when the play fails in a grandiose way, you get incredibly unpleasant fun.
