The central theme of this film seems to be confusion, as the relationships, the setting, the action and the social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element and lacks his usual clarity, impeccable direction and intensity. To make matters worse, the name of his character is "Che", and we are only told (directly, by the narrator) in the film that it is not "that" Che, just a boy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film and, once defined, the family is divided: the youngest generation in America. So clich√©. Other reviews talk about how the film describes the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; however the director's political position is at its most obscure, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (gained from the profits of gambling) - so what? Refusing to take a political position when making a film about the Cuban revolution is a strange and cowardly choice. Not to mention the film was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they have not obtained permission to shoot in Cuba. And if family life is the most important thing to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are "presented" to everyone at start - an inexpensive way to make relationships clear throughout the movie! The acting was mostly superficial, of wood and unbelievable, the times were extinguished everywhere. The "special" special effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character as a Greek choir - strictly free, intellectually ostentatious and constantly out of place. I just watched the whole movie because I was expecting clarity, or a bit of everything. It never happened
