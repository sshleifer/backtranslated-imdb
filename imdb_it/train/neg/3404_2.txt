I'm not going to buy this movie for the whole myriad of f u | c | k | u | p | s, it would take two days to outline how everything is not even remotely possible. Others have already indicated all the relevant nonsense. <br /> <br /> Given all this, I could still enjoy it, if only they hadn't included all of Maestlin's disgusting sentimental fandonia, nauseating, maddening, Disney. which is so out of place everywhere, but nowhere more than in space, where the smallest error can mean instant death. <br /> <br /> Even the "troupe", as well as the "real" astronaut, were equally guilty of putting all their nonsense nonsense in front of everything else. It completely ruined every value that the production could have left. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that NASA has left out this garbage so that so many people would have received so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you haven't seen it yet, save irritation. Look again at Apollo 13. At least that was trying to be a little real.
