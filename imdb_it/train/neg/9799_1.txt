Power Rangers, the completely horrible 90s children's show still continues to disturb children with its completeness and its terrible settings. <br /> <br /> This show was not entertainment, it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing children how to fight each other to resolve their differences. <br /> <br /> The toys were further demonstrations on how to promote a violent television program and so. <br /> <br /> I never could to understand what the purpose of this absolutely ridiculous show was. <br /> <br /> As such, it remains one of the worst show for children ever made.
