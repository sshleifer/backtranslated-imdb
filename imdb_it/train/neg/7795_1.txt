First of all, I'm not really a fan of the "meat eating in new and disgusting ways" genre, but I'm a bad emotional movie, so my neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This. So let's start looking at it. First of all - it's recorded on a video camera without a tripod! Second, the voice of the skinny white doctor is nicknamed by a great black man! Thirdly, none of the dialogues makes any sense. Fourth, the zombie scenes, though unconvincing and full of trick and poor tomato, lead me to believe that the director (and my neighbor) need psychological help. It's fun for about 5 minutes but it gets old fast. It is so amateurish that it is like looking at a badly nicknamed high school video yearbook .... with zombies. A note for anyone involved in this film - I want the 20 minutes of my life that I spent watching this, before falling asleep again.
