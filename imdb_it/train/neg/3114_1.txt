Trying to compare or represent this "swill" like anything "Hitchcockian" is an out-n-out attempt to fool Hitchcock fans to waste $ 7 on this movie ... Weak acting Weak story Weak script. <br /> <br /> No real suspense, no thrills. You wait all the weakness of this film for the great reward or even for any profit ... You stayed to think, what the hell was all this. <br /> <br /> And please, enough with the movement to make HIP "alternative lifestyles" politically correct !! ... I can't recommend it to anyone ... Did I say how weak acting is? Williams did a better job as Peter Pan and "Mork". But those were a LOT more innocent ...........
