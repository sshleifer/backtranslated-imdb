"The Return of Chandu" is noteworthy, if we can say, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain. Because he also gets the girl. <br /> <br /> History as such involves the Ubasti Black Magic Cult that attempts to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delightful Maria Alba) and use it as a sacrifice to revive their ancient chief seems to resemble Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to counteract the villains. <br /> <br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive archive footage. Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to hold off Kong in different scenes. The acting is mostly horrible. The actor who plays the high priest (I believe Luciival Prival) for example, uses that pronunciation inspired by an acting teacher who was so common in early speeches. The less it is said for others, the better. <br /> <br /> It is a mystery that Lugosi accepted parties in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a banking star at Universal right now. Maybe it was because in this case he played the hero and got the girl, who knows. As his career began to decline downward in the late 1930s, this type of fare became the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception. <br /> <br />
