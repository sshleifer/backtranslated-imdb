OK, we all love daisy duke, but what's up with this cast. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there's no such thing as this girl and Daisy isn't a girl! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to look like the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed that the HOg boss was so tall. That was part of Boss Hog's humor was his size. Have they even tried someone like Danny Devito?!? Okay, now take this and have Jessica Simpson cast someone look at her husband? Match Luke Duke to a tee !!!!!! Clearly these producers have not looked at the appearance of the old cast members. The screenshots were never present on the dukes !! This caused the movie to be disabled from the beginning. I give this HUGE thumbs down.
