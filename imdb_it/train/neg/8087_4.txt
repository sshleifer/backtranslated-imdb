The film lacks credibility with helicopters that did not exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. About the only part of the movie that could be believed was that Germany wanted to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British captured all the spies, but even if they didn't, they wouldn't let it wander around like this only to reassure the Germans that the landing would be in Calais. It's not an important thing that makes the movie not work. It's the culmination of all the wrong things that make the movie fail. Bad direction, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (all) combine to make the film flat. Generally the lights should fade into the wood. The suspense comes with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worried about being detected. This game has ended since the beginning. This spy was doing nothing but spying. Your only chance of getting something that has a certain credibility and instills a bit of suspense might be to read the book.
