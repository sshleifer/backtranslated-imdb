This film is really something of an egg of a curate, good in part. Unlike other reviewers, I discovered that the main flaw is its inability to attract the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot. I tried it because I'm interested in rock'n'roll and the dynamics of the bands, but if I had to evaluate it solely on the basis of its merit as a film, I should give the thumbs down, with some warnings: Jason Behr is good at John Livien, and quite convincing as a rock singer; the narrative concerning his childhood trauma is unclear, although we are given a hint of Livien's well-run relationship with his parents, but his behavior is ultimately bizarre for the viewer (which should not be). Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using a theatrical character to resolve inner conflicts is interesting, though not new, nor fully explored as a theme in this film. The allusions to John Lennon were irritating, but I confess I am not a Beatles fan. Anyway, Livien and her band reminded me more of Oasis than of the Beatles, in the sense that there was something derivative in them. Another frustrating thing about the film was the way it opened up with some interesting (even if of medium and high level) - philosophical reflections on the main character, but left the threads of his thought there, only to take them back half of the film very briefly, when Livien says, "before God, there was music" (never seen that announcement for Tia Maria in the 90s, "First there was Tia Maria"? This is what the it came to mind anyway); it seems an idiotic conclusion, and the viewer has no idea how he achieved it, but he has the right to do so. Fortunately his bassist and friend, skillfully played by Dominic Monaghan, seems to recognize the mistake of this thought when he answers "You don't know". <br /> <br /> In all, the limited strengths of management and the plot could go both ways on future projects, in useless banalities or in an interesting and more mature perspective.
