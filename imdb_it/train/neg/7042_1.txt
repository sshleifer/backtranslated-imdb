This must be one of the worst films ever made. Even for a biker movie, it's a real cure. The minimal plot involves a band of motorcyclists who take over a small town (how original!) And the attempts of citizens to fight them. Why don't they ask for outside help? Who knows? The fighting scenes are obviously false. Adam West and Tina Louise are there but both have little to do and both are ashamed to be there (understandably) This movie belongs to the garbage pile!
