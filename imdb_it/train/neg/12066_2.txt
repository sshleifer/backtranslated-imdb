OK, as is the case with this original, this rich old man leaves his property to his grown-up sons, all ungrateful losers and two gruesome servants, as long as they spend the week in his spooky old house. What happens that night will surprise only those who have never seen a movie or a television program. After a series of murders in which the victims look bleeding like the restaurant ketchup, we have a painfully obvious ending. The cast is led by some once respectable actors who must have been desperate for their salaries. There are also some second-rate actors who were growing up at that time, but long forgotten. As a result, the film generates all the drama and mystery of a "Matlock" episode. I'll give credit where it's due - the final scene is smart and fun, if you're still awake.
