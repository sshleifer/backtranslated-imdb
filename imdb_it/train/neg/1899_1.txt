I saw it because I thought there would be a lot of car chases and nice cars to watch. I guess they lied to me. This film is very boring. <br /> <br /> The film begins Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) sitting in front of a Porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car. When they confirm that it is the right one, Kip takes a brick from the trunk and grabs it at the window, shattering it. Get the Porsche while your friend receives the keys. They start the car and leave at night. They deliver it to a warehouse only to be followed by the police. Thus, the entire crew abandons all the machines and proceeds separately. Then, we see Memphis Raines. He is giving a small talk to a group of children on a go-kart track. Thus, it is addressed by Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee tells Memphis that his brother Kip is in * deep bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis goes to a landfill and meets Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). This guy threatens to kill Kip if Memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours. <br /> <br /> There are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> 1.Story: The first 48 The hours of the film take place when Cage and Duvall search for a crew and plan everything. The last 12 hours of film are a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: see maybe 10 out of 50 cars as the film advertises. So where are the other 40 machines? Why don't we see them? <br /> <br /> 3. The Chase: The chase at the end of the film was a joke. It was not suspense at all. <br /> <br /> 4. The Dog: Somewhere in the film, the dog eats hamburgers and even swallows three keys. This is impossible. The keys have been opened. The keys would severely damage the esophagus, the stomach and the large intestine of the dog. The boys suggest giving dogs laxatives to help them poop. This will not work. The dog will have a lot of diarrhea but no key. He was declared in Jackass after Ryan Dunne blocked a toy car on his rectum. Take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no cars. The same case with the dog. <br /> <br /> 5. The Cop During The Chase: When Eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, Nicholas Cage desperately tries to start the car. See a police cruiser behind him who doesn't look at his car at all. But, just when Nicholas Cage turns the engine on again, the police officer turns his head to the right, sees the car and immediately starts chasing him. It's stupid. So, just when he felt the engine turning on and saw the car, he knew it was the car he was looking for. How do you know it's the right car? He only sees the back. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is boring. There is no action. There are very few machines. The film is stupid. I've never seen the original but I'm going to do it. <br /> <br /> Give this movie 1 star out of 10. Take The Fast and Furious instead.
