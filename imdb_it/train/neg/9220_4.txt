When the film started the first 4 minutes it looked like a California travelogue, I wondered if I had mixed the tapes. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the beautiful Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior and then hires him as a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, the role of robots or aspects of incest. There's a good sex scene between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D +
