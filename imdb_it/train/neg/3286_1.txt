I don't understand why making remakes has become the trend. Every remake I've ever seen is horrible and no exception. If any of you have seen the quote from Ben Jones, which is a "bleak" piece of junk, he is absolutely right. Because they would make a wonderful television show, which I loved, I never lost an episode, and I have seasons 1-4 on DVD, and ruin it, I'll never know. The TV show was a family show, and even though Daisy has the body, it was really raised, or even routed to the show, except for the clothes. A family show has been turned into a dirty piece of trash, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to see it. Another thing I didn't like is that John Schneider and Tom Wopat are excellent actors (along with the rest of the original cast), and they are also extremely nice. The new Bo and Luca are not even a bit nice. That was one of the drawers for the show. The casting is terrible. They could at least have a brunette for Daisy. I don't even think Burt Reynolds is a qualified Boss Hogg. Any other role I've ever played is totally opposite to this role. The only role they chose halfway is Willie Nelson in the role of Uncle Jesse, but it is not a comparison. Denver Pyle is an actor of his own, and that made him perfect for the role. I think the casting is horrible, the story is terrible, and all in all it ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty and terrible movie. I would not recommend anyone to go and see it. I saw it only out of curiosity, plus there was a free ticket on the DVD of the fourth season. I would never have paid to see this movie, but it was free. DO NOT PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
