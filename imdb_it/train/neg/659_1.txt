This film is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. The fact that people have been paid to make this piece of trash shows that they lack original ideas and talent in the entertainment world. The idea that the public would pay to watch this film (and as an idiot I rented the film) is also daunting. <br /> <br /> An obsessed teacher (3 years before) kills a teenager's family because they want it. For no reason he kills his mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see bad acting and direction. Years later, the obsessed teacher gets out of prison. HMM - usual bad writing - nobody in the city that terrorizes knows until the last minute. Somehow obsessed teacher becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. Sure!!! Now obsessed teacher kills the hotel maid for no reason, cultivates the deliveryman for the fun of it, and starts chasing the teenager's friends. Now there is the perfect way to make yourself loved by the girl. Obsessed teacher slips out of the hotel - again he is stupid, a policeman would never know his face - but he walks right next to them. Now he kills two policemen outside the teen's house and somehow sneaks into his bedroom and kills his boyfriend. <br /> <br /> There is not a single positive thing about this piece of junk. If some other profession exhibited works of this low quality, they would be fired. Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and direct this junk.
