For the expert Beatles fans, the main value of this film is to sit down and identify defects, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, exaggerated events, omitted people, chronological errors, incorrect citations, the wrong clothes, out of songs set, and (shame shame) wrong instruments and other dishonest ones I can't think of right now. Defects come fast and furious, so you'll have to stand on your toes. <br /> <br /> I did not give this "1" mainly due to the fact that it is shot in Liverpool and the actors (the Rain band) give it their all (the character of Lennon is believable and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING. <br /> <br /> So watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically accurate.
