Although this was a TV production, there is absolutely no excuse for the results of the bottom of the finished product. This film had a limited budget and had a casting department, so if you're going to make a movie about a real life story, and actually put "the real story" in the title, no effort should be made to try and capture a bit of realism? First of all, this film is absurdly launched. These actors belong to daytime TV soap shows, or those ridiculous movies from the Lifetime channel, and not a gangster / criminal. Everything about them, from their looks to their mannerisms, only screams of the shopping-mall-alt-rock generation of the 90s. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and offensive, and even in this case it is too monotonous. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words "I'm out of here". It's like a group of "New Kids on the Block" fans joining and deciding to make a really "kewl" movie about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be totally radical and rocking. Well, this sticker doesn't even rank on the rad and rockin 'scale. Everything that can be wrong with any type of film is wrong here, from casting and acting to editing and music. Every single thing is seriously wrong ... and it is exasperating that the responsible parts of this atrocious turkey have had the courage to put "the real story" in the title. It is certainly not the true story, but worse still, it is not nearly as funny as a mindless popcorn movie that is accepted on its terms. As I stated in my column, it is simply horrible beyond words, at every level imaginable. Trust me on this, or look at your own risk.
