I have no intention of facing and criticizing the theories of RAW. I mean, this is a film site and if the film offers or is well done, and not a philosophy of discussion of the site. <br /> <br /> That said, this video really blows. It is one shot at the head of RAW after another. Some of these are archive videos, so you can see how it has aged over the years, and this is really cool. But otherwise, the visual experience is inexorably monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a strange comparison, but I kept thinking about Sunday afternoon when I looked at the stellar vehicle of Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * (another bad movie). After a while, I was so freaked out by Barbra, I kept hoping there would be a scene where she wouldn't show up: you know, "meanwhile, the other characters in the movie were up to something else ... ." moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well, this video is * Funny Lady * from RAW. <br /> <br /> So if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at more sockets and angles of RAW's face while he prattles with his theories, assembled into a lame structure that adds no interest or intuition, then be my guest. For me, I couldn't take it after 20 minutes.
