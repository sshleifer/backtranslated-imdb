"Horrible People" should be the subtitle of this horrible film. If you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things, then look at real life from your window. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing boring things, you have to watch this horrible Mike Leigh movie. The characters talk for a long time, but they never manage to communicate with each other. Why not? Presumably because Leigh thinks we are all as ineffective and pathetic as his actors, and wants to film real life. But we are not, and it has failed.
