Are you kidding me?! A show that highlights someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How much talent do you have to be to do this? COULD be able to cook but is NOT depicted in this half-hour stomach that produces a painful production. I know he has an empire of Martha-Stewart-esquire. That's what Warren Buffett does, but I don't see him with the fake batsmen who open cans of corn cream and Alpo. <br /> <br /> He has a nephew named ... Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about someone with such a stupid name. <br /> <br /> More time is devoted to "table-scapes" than to the kitchen itself. Who has that kind of time ?! Silicon should be on your spatula, not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network, NOT Food Network.
