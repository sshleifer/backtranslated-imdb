Because every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete riddle for me, given that the "classic" by William Friedkin is a highly overrated film and, in my opinion, not so tense or shocking. Yet here is another repulse, a Spaniard this time, who shamelessly repeats the story of a girl who is possessed by pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (which I must admit seems very hot here) plays the honorable priest who is approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior has changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the priest does not believe it, but when John's body is discovered with a twisted neck, Leila's demonic behavior becomes more evident ... "Exorcism" is not only very little original, it is also an unbearably film boring! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to carry out a religious-themed exploitation full of shock and blood, yet the result is a domesticated and bloodless drama that will almost make you fall asleep! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, even if very stupid, and there are quite a few feminine nudity and style sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is not a real excuse given that Paul Naschy has already demonstrated before having enough imagination to make up for a shortage of money. This is just a horrible movie, the end of the story. Other European scams of "The Excorcist" are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they suck!
