Listening to the director's comment confirmed what I had suspected while watching the film: this is a film made by a guy who wants to play a movie. The plot is the kind of thing that disappointed teenagers turn out when they go through the "I could write a book / script / award a sitcom" phase. There is a germ of an interesting idea buried there (probably because it is a sequel of someone else's film), but it is completely buried by a written script, poorly interpreted and ridiculously discouraged. <br /> <br /> The lines are disastrous and the performances are not engaging, even if, again, I am inclined to blame the director. It seems that he didn't consult the actors at all about what is required, rather he made the script in their hands, pointed the camera at them and told them to go ahead with it. Who knows, with a bit of coaching, these actors may have absolved better (let's say what you like about musicians in movies, Jon Bon Jovi was excellent in Row Your Boat and more than acceptable in The Leading Man). <br /> <br /> As it stands, the cast has no chemistry whatsoever. A good opportunity to use the classic sex and parallel vampirism has passed when, to infect the character of Bon Jovi with vampire blood from his co-hunter in distress, he is given a transfusion. She should have bitten him. Mind you, they should have seemed vaguely interested in each other during the rest of the film. The only real moment of sexual tension between the two female protagonists is by the directors of their own accidental admission. Originally he intended to use this silent sequence as an excuse for a more useless plot display - so, I suppose the finished product could have been conceivably worse. But not much. <br /> <br /> Frankly, as the films go, this is badly traced, foolish and forgettable. Even if trashy movies go, it's not sexy enough or bloody enough to be fun. It could have been a fun, bloody puzzle, but the director left with more than one play, for all the wrong reasons.
