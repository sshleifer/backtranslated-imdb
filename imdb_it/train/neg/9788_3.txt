Not that I don't like films for children, but this was a tear-jerker with few salvific qualities. M. J. Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly fun, but the chance is not given in this film. It is sugary sugar and it could hardly be appreciated by anyone over 7 years old. See instead Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek. 3/10
