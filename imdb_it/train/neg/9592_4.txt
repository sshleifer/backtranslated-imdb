I only saw the movie recently, even though it appeared in 2001. I was hoping to see a funny movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The "princess" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed ... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only looked at his point of view, then beat his opponents. During the whole movie, I waited to hear at least one confession about what she liked, why she was fighting, who she loved and trusted. I waited in vain. Lousy movie. Bad dialogue Don't watch it if you don't want to be bored by your mind! It's so ugly, I was finally wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration for 1 Â½ hours. About. I give a 4/10.
