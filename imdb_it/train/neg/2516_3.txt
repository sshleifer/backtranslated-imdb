Unfortunately I don't remember the book anymore, but I remember that I was fascinated by the stories of Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical low-quality German production. It does not attract my attention - although the story itself is good, it is only badly adapted. At the center of the misery are the excessively simplified and exaggerated characters - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and beloved German actors, Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Are, cannot save this poor show. However there is hope ... I have been told that the films that follow this film are improving. So, in conclusion, I must say that this film does not deserve the movie screen, but it could be enough for a lazy afternoon.
