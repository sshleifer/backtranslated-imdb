Ivan (Valeri Nikolayev) is a bitter and cynical journalist who investigates the inexplicable. Travel to this small town where it is said that a witch (Ita Ever) is terrorizing the community. <br /> <br /> His car stops and takes refuge in a small building, and meets a beautiful and mysterious girl. Suddenly he turns into a demon and he kills her, and the city wonders who killed this woman ... I guess she was the witch, but I'm not entirely sure. Ivan is now haunted by his spirit, or something like that, and he must have faith, or something, to beat him. <br /> <br /> I really hate Christian movies. They are usually full of lame actors, stupid plot and minimal effects. Not to mention that this is not just a Christian film ... but also a foreign one. The voice-over actor for Ivan has made the film more comical than terrifying, because it is so acute and plaintive. You won't miss out on losing this movie.
