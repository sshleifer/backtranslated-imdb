"You won't shoot those little creatures, they didn't hurt you in the first place, secondly they could be radioactive." Ah, the joys of sci-fi no-budget ?? Yet, despite the strange gem of the genre, Superman and Mole-Men is quite interesting even with a run time of 58 minutes. Is it beyond the low price (the only shot of Superman flying is an incredible few inept animation frames) and rather boring with it, even if it has a surprisingly altruistic message ?? the silent Mole-Men, tiny actors with enlarged skulls and furs that look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without a hat than subterranean creatures freed from their underground world by oil drilling are not mischievous, simply misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel seeks prevent the local small town crowd led by Jeff Corey to kill them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.
