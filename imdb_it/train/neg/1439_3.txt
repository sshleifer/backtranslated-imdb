I give 3 stars only for the beautiful photos of Africa. The rest was ... well rather boring. For about 50 minutes we have the outline of the plot ... In War of the Worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10 minutes? So it was real action! This is something like: "Let's take a walk in the savannah and be breathless in front of the beautiful sunsets!" And maybe deliver a message, like "Don't kill elephants!" Very ecological I would have expected this from a "new" Steven Segal film, not from this ... The lead actress makes me think of artificial tanning, dyed hair and too many bases! And I haven't seen a scene where his hair is messed up, or sweats, or his clothes are dusty. You don't look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar, where our hero is looking, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and became famous in the coming years. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900 .. Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze makes a good impression ... in a few words: hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly inside. Not that I'd let myself be pampered with a madman, but you understand the point. He can really get that puppy hit on his face on several occasions. The film stank. Too long and increasingly boring. don't watch it! Don't buy it! It's a waste of money!
