I saw this film only because I was so impressed by Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some nice characters and made sense. The bullfighter had none of these. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it couldn't possibly be good, after all, the always painfully bad Michelle Forbes had a leading role. <br /> <br /> A poster here called the inconsistent film. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave too much credit to the film. I'm so happy to have received it for free from the library, yet I still feel screwed. <br /> <br /> IMDb must include a "0" in the "vote this movie" vote, only for films like this one.
