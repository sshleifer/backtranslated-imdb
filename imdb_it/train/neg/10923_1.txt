TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 1920s during the filming of the first version of DeMille of the 10 Commandments and that is awakened when DeMille sets are brought to light in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is: have the directors been serious or joking when they made this film? If this is serious, it is a ridiculous film and a fantastic film to be exploited for its wickedness. If his play is less beautiful but fun for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard in this film, probably more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
