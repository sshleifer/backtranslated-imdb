This was a strange film. It started pretty well. A solid soundtrack behind flash images of blood and chaos while our psychopath did his thing. <br /> <br /> Then its "down down" arrives Here I could say that I had a real "B" movie. Poor acting, I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys couldn't. After the scene of the death of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the film starts ... <br /> <br /> From this point on there are the big actor's tits, the occasional bucket of blood and the scenes badly made of death. <br /> <br /> That said, I gave the film a four because despite its flaws it kept a sort of creepiness that I just couldn't shake off. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie, but I have to admit that it seems worse to me.
