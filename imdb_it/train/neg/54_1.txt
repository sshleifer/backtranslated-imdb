The only positive thing about this film was the scene of Goldie Hawn standing in her French trimmed bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other women depraved from removing her little cotton top while giggling and cooing. Ooooof! His loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This film came out when I was fourteen and that shot almost killed me. I had forgotten everything that was hidden in the bad Roladex of my mind until I saw it the other day on TV, where in reality the middle part of that scene was confused, good pain, reminding me that sexy girl of a Goldie Hawn woman was in the 80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
