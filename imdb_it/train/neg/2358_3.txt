In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teenager on Elm Street. Quitting ANY scare any unintended attempts at humor and useless celebrity cameos (let's go .. Reandene ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? demons has ever had. Wow was a piece of shit. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stink of this movie disappear. And when the hell did Freddy happen to have a daughter ?? The entire film is seriously delayed in every way, form and form. Rachel Talalay, you smell in the sky, baby. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Cast and Crew Bios; Switch to the 3D sequence and switch to the options of a nightmare (you can find more extras for the film on the seventh disc of The Nightmare Collection DVD set) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom Contents: trivia game; Film script; and web connection
