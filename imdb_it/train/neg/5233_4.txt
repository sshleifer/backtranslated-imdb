Quite awful but watchable and fun. It's the same old story (if you lived until the 1980s). Vietnam veterans fight together as friends against injustice in the United States. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, the soldiers go home and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, the friend is dead and it is his father who is in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely exaggerated (very pointed) meat tenderizer as he tries to defend his father's small shop from the local "protection" band despite being confined to a wheelchair since the war. Desperate for help, his father talks to Sarge, the head of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, when Sarge shows up for the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the squeaky wheel gets fat, and the old gang is riding around the city. You can almost imagine most of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that drove me crazy is that Sarge continues to harangue his men on planning and how they are really good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey wouldn't be put in a wheelchair with a shot in Vietnam, first if the unit hadn't been around! Then, when things are going really well in the city while fighting gangs, they do it again. For no reason, they completely ignore their plan and try to nail the band without everyone being present. PHH !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Trifle! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all the present members of the unit make sure they try the heroin they snatch from the band to make sure it's real. Each of them. Hmm .... <br /> <br /> What are you going to do? Keep looking, I guess. The film is not too horrible to watch, but it is a joke. There are all these culminating moments when nothing really happens. The most dramatic things that happen are those at the beginning of the film - the explosives in Vietnam, the battle of Joey's death, and the gang that brutally kicked an innocent teddy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I imagine that my main meat with this film is that I feel disappointed. Even the sub-stories confused with "mysterious helpers" and their bizarre cross-purposes were not enough to save him in the end. But one day maybe everything will come and follow up. Ha ha ha ha !!!
