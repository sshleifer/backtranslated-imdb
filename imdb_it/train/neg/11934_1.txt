I sat through almost an episode of this series and couldn't take it anymore. It seemed to have seen dozens of episodes, and then it hit me ..... There is nothing new here! I heard that joke about Seinfeld, I saw someone fall like that into friends, an episode of Happy Days had almost the same plot, etc. None of the actors is interesting here! Some were good on other shows (not here), and others are new to a profession they should never have entered. Avoid this stinker!
