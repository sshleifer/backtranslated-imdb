The only words you need fear more than Joe Don Baker if you think you are watching a movie are Greydon Clark, and if they're both there, run to save your life. However this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously! It starts badly and comes down from there, repeated scenes, Good The Bad and The Ugly as shootout will make you roll on the floor with a laugh. Yes, he's the best deputy sheriff in Texas, tracking down a mafia hit man in Malta as only he can. He makes his rules, does things his way, while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms-style cowboys. Want to see a bad but fun movie? Go ahead, it's your move!
