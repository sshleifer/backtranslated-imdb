This is one of the worst movies I've seen in years !! You could randomly tear 5 people off the streets and they could behave better than anyone in this movie. Absolute waste of time watching it. I only gave him a 2 because I like blood movies, but this is just rubbish. The acting (and I use that word VERY vaguely) is abysmal, can someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this movie were making their first film? Don't waste time looking at this. Hostel was a better film somehow. I can't believe that someone spent money to do it, I hope it cost the producer only $ 50,000 - it looks like a school project, made by children who have no idea. Has this even reached the cinema?
