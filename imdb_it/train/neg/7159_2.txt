I thought I would never find such a bad horror film as "The Return of the Chainsaw Texas Massacre", but this film is in competition with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not a person who falls asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the start of the Trance. I woke up and started looking at him. Why did I deserve it? The whole film was torture, I have to go fast to see it complete. <br /> <br /> I can't stand it because one of my favorite actors of all time (MR WALKEN) could do this. I have to think that he did the director a favor, or that he really needed money, because he is making films after films, he is ruining; and so fast ... <br /> <br /> And the movie? it's not a scary, stupid plot, the characters are horrible (but I really liked the one played by Jared Harris), the effects are very scarce, the lack of deaths and blood, etc.; in three words, he has something. And I'm serious. I don't know how a director can make a film like this. <br /> <br /> However, when I was most disappointed it was when I saw on the cover of the video that the movie was presented by "Stephen King", I think he could never present this shit, right? (I rented it in Argentina). I wouldn't recommend it in a million years. <br /> <br /> I consider this film with a 2 out of 10. (As I said in my review "The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre", there will always be a worse movie, which is why it doesn't deserve a 1 out of 10)
