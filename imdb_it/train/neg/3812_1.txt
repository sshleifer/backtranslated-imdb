Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? All the characters are so annoying that it's impossible to bear. The best character is Joey and even he is rather irritating occasionally. A DJ girl who wrote her character? I want to kill myself every time he speaks. to mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ has won about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. However, he is not eighteen, so he should not play according to the law. However, the casino was ready to pay her the money, but then Danny, her father picked her up and didn't let her collect that money because she wasn't eighteen. Oh come on, give me a break, right? Since I saw that stupid and childish scene, I instantly turned off the television. Something in this series, not even a child would buy. Would anyone in the world think that Full House is fun and funny? Every single word they say in this series seems to be like Shakespeare wrote except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that it wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something so stupid like they wrote in the script for Full House! <br /> <br /> For all those who have an infected heart or any kind of bad medical condition or any will for life or any sense of the real world, I highly recommend 'Don't look at the full house'! Not even an episode as proof. Avoid this series. Saved from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather watch Teletubbies then. "Don't look at this."
