After watching this I thought to myself, there are too few writers and directors or many producers. <br /> <br /> However, this is a terrible film. Terrible in a way that isn't funny, but rather makes you grit your teeth and make people tremble. It makes you scream "this is wrong" in the film. The dive is zero. By now most of you are probably used to the terrible mistakes / oddities in movies that contain cyber hackers, etc. This film is so in every aspect. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about the film is little Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope you become great, and do everything ... It is worth at least something. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor. Don't look at this. There is not even adequate action in it. Total waste of time
