The premise of this film is revealed on the DVD packaging. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that does not deteriorate. But the film fails to make it. Instead it sticks for 45 minutes, twisting around a preamble before making the big discovery. Since the public does not benefit much from seeing a little boy who understands things, it is a strange choice: the film has been successfully prevented from involving any topic. Once the fabric was discovered, the film established too quickly that both the big shots of the industry and the blue worker colleagues wanted the invention to be stifled, leaving the film with only two fragile movements; invent the chemical and run to the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why someone describes it as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It is more a serious social critique of the day: that capitalism distorts both supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, it is probably true, but without a certain play with an attitude towards this fact, the film is simply a serious subject. You will need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find one here. <br /> <br /> This is more like a British meeting John Doe (meets Nigel Doe?).
