First let me prefigure this post saying I'm a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I don't read books, play, wear underwear or eat cereal (if there is one). I'm just a fan of movies. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I find it hard to see how people are giving this praise to this film. Taking this film alone, and not comparing it to his terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how one can say that this is a fantastic film. For all the terrible shortcomings of the script - style dialogues, artificial scenes (for example R2 suddenly a bullshit, and long CGI chases that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting and known holes in the plot ... how good ? ? There was no real internal dilemma in Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was upside down and suddenly it was evil. I wasn't interested in the film until the last 20 minutes or so (which by the way was ruined by the Frankenstein scene "NOOOOOO!"). When BOMBARD the screen with intensely surprising CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely atrocious one-liners when more could and should have said, this is NOT A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with a tone so "dark", there was too much light in the speech of ALL the characters. <br /> <br /> I close with a question: from the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was really going to happen?
