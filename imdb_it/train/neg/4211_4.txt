About 4 years ago, I liked this movie. I would watch it again and again and again. But now ... no. Actually, I think this movie would have been great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a lot of heavy-comment actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg), and a pretty funny storyline. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and he runs into a gang and a gang member says "Hey, Tyler! Where are you? The MOON ??" Also look for the classic line, "Do you feel on tiptoe?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's better than "The Good Son".
