I really enjoyed the film, emotionally, intellectually and visually. It contains no violence, sex, drugs or special effects, and it does not need some, keeping my attention all the time with images, stories and words of wisdom interspersed. <br /> <br /> However: [1] some of the accents of the foreign language have made dialogue difficult to hear and understand; [2] there is unnecessary excessive use of swear words (in particular the word F, which is the only reason why this film was classified R). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the excitement that keeps you throughout the film, except the final resolution of the last few minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to the loss, to live in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] I will not recommend this film because of the 5 seconds of storytelling in the background, which do not add a single bit to the side character it is applied to, or to the movie - it just pushed me to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole film and later: the mother of the main character of German origin, when she watched the old films of the Second World War, "secretly roots for the Germans". There would be no "local color" or art if the Nazis had won the war. I don't know any German today, except the radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazis won World War II.
