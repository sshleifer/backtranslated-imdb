I hear about an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With progress over the last 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in the mouth of the whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco. <br /> <br /> And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a milestone in the history of entertainment. After the attempt "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the compact cassette" and the decidedly tacky "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates the 8-track tape", who would have expected such a glorious film? I'm crying right now thinking about it.
