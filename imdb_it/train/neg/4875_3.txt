My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when it was released in theaters in 1998, and so we happily bought tickets, popcorn and soda, and walked into the theater and sat down to watch the movie. In the end, the audience didn't clap hard, I remember that I heard some people say they didn't like it at all, I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty stupid, and it wasn't worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him, the whole film was ugly, I rarely laughed at the parts in this, I also remembered that the other people in the theater hardly even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was to make animals talk, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, I'm totally a bastard! I said that, apart from the hysterical touch of Eddie Murphy, this film is not worth looking at, it's rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in many movies and I thought it was funny those, I just said it was the only fun part of this movie, I also didn't see Eddie Murphy in the really "big" movie , The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This film is not a film that I highly recommend seeing, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably won't like it, especially since there are many talking animals! <br /> <br /> I will give this film a 3-star rating on a possible 10-star rating.
