Very obsolete films with terrible dialogues, exhausted by clich√©s and mushy and a very poor construction. Furthermore, Cassavetes and Falk constantly entertain. A pseudo "good movie". It does not take time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is. The first scene is total boredom, full of histrionics and hysterical exchanges. The sound is horrible. Camera movements are as unimaginative as character building is. No poetry, no subtle psychology, no interesting shots. Actors constantly smoke and see beer drinks advertising. Very cheap, really. (An exception: the nice and simple way of Ned Beattie to play the killer).
