Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well-established "hero" whom we know well from books and films. This movie or this story does not work and I have heard that it is not an error by Agatha. The cast is not good, the actors are exaggerated and make silly gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) seems fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy of the mysterious drama. The actor who plays Herculis Puaro is doing a good job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as already said, perfect and fake. The story is not very fascinating, even if it is a mystery of murder, but who cares about the death of a blond and extremist woman with cold and vicious blood in the Iraqi desert?! The "victim" is not nice.
