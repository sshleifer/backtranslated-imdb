Suppose you have been on a desert island for the last ten years. I've never heard of Scream and left when Halloween entered Part 1 at the cinema. So this movie would have been explosive and a completely new vision of the horror scene. <br /> <br /> At the moment, a rating of 2.7 is on IMDb and does not deserve such a poor appreciation. Cut all the way, like "I know what you did", and a who-is-it that, coming to the end, convinced me of who and why. <br /> <br /> No big surprise, just a good movie to watch with a cola, popcorn and no desire to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If the rental of the video is out of the best titles, you can take it without risk, but don't expect a masterpiece. I've seen a lot worse.
