If you have loved actors, Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal and Bill Cobbs, you don't need Billy Burke, Coolio or other distractions. The great talent is totally wasted in "Three Days to Vegas", with the guilt that falls directly into the script. My neighbor's holiday films are just as interesting in this misleading film. If you want to see how to use a veteran cast with a good script, take a look at "The Crew". There really are no redeeming factors here, and watching these wonderful actors struggling with such weak material is a crime. I wanted to like it, but the superficial script cheats the audience, essentially giving the actors nothing to work with. - MERK
