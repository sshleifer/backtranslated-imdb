I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure this would have been a good movie if something happened. Nothing does. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20 odd minutes. Heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who hasn't worked for a while - looking for a part that could sound like a cash desk clerk in a supermarket. Visit the supermarket where he works. Nothing happens. He decides to give him a ride home and they go from an Arby, a target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Never. <br /> <br /> I don't understand. But I don't even understand the films of Bill Murray "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like those movies, maybe you'll like them. A lot of people find movies like this extravagant, fascinating, or - for reasons that escape me - find fascinating dialogue. A common device in films of this genre is to have a long pause of silence / silence after an actor has realized a line that should be significant. We know it's significant because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I must be a philistine. I don't understand For me, this type of film is not fun, fascinating or inspiring. They are simply boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No tension. No laughter. Without suspense No action. Nothing to look at. In short, none of the things I go to the movies for. I can get bored for free. I see extravagant / bizarre characters in real life. I go to Target, fast-food restaurants and self-washes. These elements don't make a movie, even if the stars are doing this stuff. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you are crazy about Morgan Freeman and just like to hear him talk about nothing, have fun. If you want to drool Paz Vega, you can watch it and listen to it. But nothing happens, I promise. A total mess.
