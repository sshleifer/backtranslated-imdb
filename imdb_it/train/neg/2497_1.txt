There is only one problem with this website, you cannot give a negative rating. Also, a companion voted this as a grade D movie. I say it was too cute. A piece of wood could show more emotion than the actors in this film, and the money used to produce this film would have been better used to light a fire. This is absolutely terrible, 2 hours of life when anyone who survives this talentless bloodbath will never come back. After watching the 5 minutes, my boys and I wondered if the sinking of heavy bodies could make it more fun. Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later I finally found some of these G grades that act remotely. It is an insult on this entire planet that the director thought someone could find something useful from this, he had to go buy a rope. And to the actors in this movie, I hope you paid well for being in this joke because I doubt you could ever work again. In summary, I love everybody in this film 100 points of size and 12 points of demerit of your acting license.
