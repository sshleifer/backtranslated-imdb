I went to visit one of my relatives some time ago, and we jumped out of a theater, so we thought we would go in and start this movie. What a mistake! This film is terrible in every department. I had never heard of the film before, and literally everyone hasn't done it yet. No wonder, this is the highest grade you get. It's a comedy, so he says, well, the only funny thing is the ability, or lack of it, of the director to make a film like that. Arriving so close to Christmas, this should be titled like cooking a turkey underground in about an hour and a half - or as long as it was while I was leaving. At the end of the film, you will come out as if you were poisoned by food in a sick turkey, and you will regret having wasted time with these dribbles. Who knows why these things are done. Some people had left the theater before the film was finished, and I blame myself for not having walked much earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all that comes to mind is a poor TV movie that should be shown at 2 am, in fact, it's so bad, daytime TV shouldn't show it what else can you say ... probably not enough swear words could make it justice.
