If you appreciate the renaissance of Asian horror, don't worry about Gawi. The film does not deserve to be mentioned alongside works like A-list, such as Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even material as good as The Eye or Inner Senses). Those films are full of subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters and a decidedly non-Western approach to what is scary. Gawi is tied together with the remaining limbs and organs of everything that has made the American horror horrible for the last twenty-five years. <br /> <br /> The film tries to blend the Asian ghost story with the Hollywood movie, but it's a bad adaptation. An aesthetic is destined to suffocate the other; guess which one? Not having a story of its own to tell filmmakers looting Ringu for an evil subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, disgusting characters, dull plots, a boring ghost, I have a buzz.
