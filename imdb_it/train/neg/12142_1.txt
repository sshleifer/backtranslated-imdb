Please, for God's sake, don't look at it. Now saying this, I know what you're thinking, it can't be so ugly, isn't it? If everyone says it wrong as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do it! It will be like watching a horrible accident involving small children and a gas tanker! You will be marked for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only watch half an hour before becoming violently ill. The acting is the worst I've ever seen and I've seen Barbwire !!! If you risk tearing your eyes and renting this movie ... don't say I didn't warn you! The cover and the plot are a trap !! Zombies? Satire? Shaun of the Dead was great! This film must be the same .... right? NO!! Writing = crap directing = garbage acting = there was no acting. Not convinced yet? Then forever your soul will be tormented !!!
