This is the kind of thing that just now excites the film eggheads. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will let you know that the Real Men don't watch anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It would have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say here. The reason for the room-as-voyeur was nothing new. Have we forgotten De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or anything from Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So all we get is the extended metaphor of the young as Truffaut, who spends all his free time "squinting" at the cinema, which destroys school discipline, is accused of plagiarism (the numerous petty theft) and eventually escapes the boundaries of society to make "his film". Sorry ... I've been there, I've done it too many times for this to count.
