What a lousy movie! The worst of the worst! This movie is as fun as a dead snail. Non-talent-that-never-ever-actors, stupid plot. Who wrote this script?! Has there ever been a script for this stupid movie or did the director accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film as they went along? Is this meant to be a children's movie or a comedy or what? My friends, younger brother, are in 6th grade and he and his classmates have just made an amateur film for their school project that surpassed this brilliant film .. This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this movie!
