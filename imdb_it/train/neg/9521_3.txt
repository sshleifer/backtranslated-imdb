This film has received a lot of work lately during the day on HBO or Cinemax. The reason is that they are assuming that people would be interested in comparing it with the eponymous Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks of the same name. The only reason to see it is for the attractive Matt Lattanzi. Yum! Although I have to say that Matt was more than a little long in the tooth to play a high school student. If she were a woman, they would have had him play a high school mother! (Is it just me, or is your daughter starting to look like Shelley Duvall?) Oh yes, the plot - who cares? Typical teen highjinx played by adults.
