What does this film mean ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> It has some impressive underwater photographs! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well sometimes! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music is accelerated! Especially when the shark or the bad guys are about to enter! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's slowed down! How to convey to the public is going to be the moment of sympathy! <br /> <br /> Like another bites the dust! As if in a "western spagetti" this has much similarity with! <br /> <br /> It's not like Italians can't produce quality productions! There was a series of TV movies with a title like "Octopus" numbered from 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But alas, you won't find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was made around the 60s! Unfortunately 20 years had passed, as shown by a funeral scene towards the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the very sharp bite of the fast shark that repeatedly brings out a red powder in bluish waters! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everything, in the bar fight or by watching the last bloody sea demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark, the hero's companion looks through his glasses of little concern, as if he too he was bored in his incessant role in the midst of a lack of much evidence of the plot or the development of anyone's character! <br /> <br /> At least the hero points to a fleetingly late concern for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music fails to awaken our realization, we have the sinister sound in the voices of the bad guys, as if pushing us to push towards us that another dark action is about to emerge ! <br /> <br /> And towards the end someone has thought of a turning point! Just when we thought it was completely predictable! But stay tuned, folks, because you might find another turning point! If you are watching closely! For more or less, warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the hero's advice and eat a few beers along the way! It will make your vision of "Night of the Sharks" more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then you'll be ready for something like a "007" movie to get back to reality when it's over !!!
