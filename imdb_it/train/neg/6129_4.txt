Judging from this movie and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I wouldn't put Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great comedians on the silent screen. There simply isn't enough. Maybe he was going to develop his style, but he sabotaged himself by taking his first big hits too seriously. In any case, all his tricks are reminiscent of the funniest men, but he lacks Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's prodigious ingenuity. He also undermines his own person by dressing and walking like the tramp character of Chaplin. His marks are childish innocence, timidity of approach and tendency not to react to the calamity by looking perplexed, beating his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films derives from the destiny that launches various obstacles in his path that he tries to overcome in naive or naive ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing stones at an approaching tornado to drive him away, propping up a collapsed building with a boulder two by four or dodge by lifting one leg so that it rolls under him. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross country race to advertise the shoes of a rival company, he manages to win by pure luck. There's nothing here that hasn't been done much better by the Big Three.
