If movies like Ghoulies snatch the Gremlins, the Hobgoblin sink into the new level of ripping out garbage like the Ghoulies. These barely animated furbys have some sort of pattern to make fantasies (involving the sexual dreams of grotesque characters - oh joy), but what has to do with anything is someone's hypothesis, except to let the director grant your passion for eroticism. They show it in the eighth circle of Hell, one is suspected. There is no real plot - just "goblin - kill!" and weak attempts at humor and a bland attempt to arouse public interest.
