This film made me very angry. I wanted desperately to strangle the "scientists" and the invisible filmmakers during the course. Very, very painful to sit on. Suffering and pretentious in the worst way. The little good information on brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of ​​New York horses. The worst offenders were the charlatans of the charlatana Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead a life of mediocrity and clearly imply that, on the other hand, he lives on a higher plane. Even the ideas and attitudes with which I substantially agree are presented in a way so heavy, clumsy, superior, pretentious, whining that I felt the desire to disavow them. I think that's what made me so angry, the fact that they took what are really profound aspects of established scientific thought and ruined them with their new era of hokum. Much of it is based on the error of applying the concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Appropriately, the portions dramatized with Marlee Matlin are amateur and cliché. <br /> <br /> I would refer instead to Bill Bryson's excellent scientific research: "A brief history of almost everything". There is a lot of profound wonder about life and the universe in current and established science.
