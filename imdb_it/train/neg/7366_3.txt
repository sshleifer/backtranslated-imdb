What was this F * @ # that I just saw? Steven STOP !! Please! This film is unbearably bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (of course) wishes-are-are-as-vampires "like" creatures with a superhuman strength. ok? Oh, and their eyes blink inhumanly? Wow! However, even in this movie, to appease the ego of Seagals who must have the ultimate punch-and-no-one-kick-my-a-$$, HE is somehow stronger than them. However all the common humans are crashing around him. Come on, I can understand the neighborhood bully or the drug dealer, but these are people of super human strength. Oh, and take this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity problems, because apparently he and his cohorts in the movie think it's Wolverine! Oh my God ... And worse than all this! Yes, it gets worse. He has a voice that even changes his voice in mid-sentence while we look at his face. Obviously they don't look like him and I think he could be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off, I always watch a movie that ends. This is a historic low even for your Steven video direct movies. Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Two thumbs down! Quality Redemeption? Well, I guess so, I'll be honest in this aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for actors and actresses. The women were all very attractive. IMO. And yet, and I said STILL, it doesn't make up for the brash X-Men, Underworld, (enter your favorite movie about zombies, vampires here)! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed and exiled from the world of cinema. I think I hear the way most people feel about Blood Rayne (and almost every other Uwe Boll photo) on this movie. This is my whole $ 1.00 on this movie. See if you dare.
