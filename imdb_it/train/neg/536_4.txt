The story of a woman (Ann) on her deathbed, her two daughters (Nina and Costanza) and her reflections on her past. The flashbacks are about a weekend where young Ann is in the marriage of her friend Lila. At the wedding she meets Harris who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all the ups and downs of her professional and family life, she remembers him as her true love. His daughter Constance is older, more "responsible", a mother of two and has things together. Nina jumps from her boyfriend to her boyfriend and works at work and is not sure of her direction in life. <br /> <br /> First of all the good. The details of the period in the film are fantastic. Clothes, hair, cars, houses, etc. They really put you in another time and place. And there's a quality acting in the film. Vanessa Redgrave is quite good at portraying the main character and her fragile state of mind as her life draws to a close. Claire Danes is beautiful and does a great job as a protagonist when she was young (and she is an exceptional singer). Hugh Dancy brought a lot of life to the character of Lila's brother, Buddy. <br /> <br /> Now for the villain, which unfortunately is all the rest. Things constantly interrupt the story as it is explained to us. The chemistry between young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. So ... you should believe that he doesn't really like him more than a friend and that his torment only annoys her. And I thought that everything, "he could be gay", was out of nowhere and had no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character acts in wood and creepy. If it was another genre, you would have known that Harris was the serial killer from the beginning. It's amazing to think that all these girls loved him like that (but they portray the other boys as rather lame to try to help him). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem of all. Why are Ann and Harris not together? They fall in love with each other. They have this fantastic night of sex in an old dirty gardener's shack, come home to discover Buddy's tragic death and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet A few years later, they look at each other and I can't help but wonder why. WHY? The film does not make you understand why they were forced to marry other people and so I had difficulty feeling sorry for them. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is quite boring. The good daughter of clichés and the bad daughter of the cliché. Nina changes over the course of the film, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what drives her to change her life. There is a "touching" scene in which the daughters connect that coincides with the old Ann who dreams of chasing a butterfly. It's really lousy and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There are no mistakes," advises Anna. The statement does not sound true with history. And it doesn't sound real after seeing the movie and wishing you hadn't wasted the talent of such good actors.
