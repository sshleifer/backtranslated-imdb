It seemed that this movie could be fun and interesting from its description. But for me he was a little disappointed. Very slow and difficult to follow and see what was happening. It was as if the director had taken single movie pieces and thrown them into the air and joined them together in whatever way they landed (certainly not in sequential order). Furthermore, nothing important was filmed. I have seen several Korean films and have noticed that a good part is well done and requires some reflection from the viewer, which is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But this confused me endlessly. I saw the film a second and third time and still did nothing for me. I still don't understand what the director was trying to convey. If it were just to show a typical trivial part of a person's life, I imagine he succeeded. But I was looking for more. Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
