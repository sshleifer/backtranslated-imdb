I'm a big fan of the karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I saw this movie after seeing Fiza, which was absolutely fantastic. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are bad, and there are movies that are cr * p. but this film takes only the biscuit. <br /> <br /> We are so annoyed that we were scammed for paying our money by expecting a decent movie. <br /> <br /> avoid at all costs, don't even rent it. <br /> <br /> 1/10
