The film is a very long story of a classic novel that absolutely fails to capture the spirit of the original adventure. The horribly American Patrick Swayze is portrayed as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality. <br /> <br /> The film continues throughout the history of "Hollywood-ise" by changing both the plot and the characters to adapt more comfortably to the accepted mold. The film manages to be predictable everywhere, even to those who are not familiar with the story and are tormented by some extremely bad and terribly disappointing fighting performances. <br /> <br /> All in all, a terrible addition to the already rather ugly collection of films based on the legend of King Soloman's Mines and Allan Quatermain.
