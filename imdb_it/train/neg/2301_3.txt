Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it just upset the people watching it? when I'm flipping through the channels and coming to this show, I look halfway through morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. what I don't know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson has few consequences. he is an old man who thinks in an old way. the fear of damnation no longer has the same effects as it once did (thank God). Now if someone answers my question, I'll dodge lightning for the rest of eternity.
