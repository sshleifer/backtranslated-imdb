well its officer. they just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this and the others were horrible. I mean that the story is about two university brotherhoods fighting each other for their houses, I mean, come and talk about a weak plot, the first three treaties with growth, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to try to confront Steven Stifler, but without a cigar. I consider this film a 3 because in the film there are 2-3 funny bits. <br /> <br /> The best character in this movie, of course, is Jim's father, I don't know why he continues to do it badly developed films.
