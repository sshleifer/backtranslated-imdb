My favorite part was when the credits started running. I wish I could give a .0000000000001 out of 10. I really want to have that hour and thirty minutes back. Don't waste money or time. I could really see the grass grow and feel better after the lanes. <br /> <br /> Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career. But she chose to be in it. <br /> <br /> All in all it sucked more than any other film sucked. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. This is saying something. <br /> <br /> Don't <br /> <br /> Make it <br /> <br /> it !!!!
