I'm a big fan of Steven Seagal. Hell, I probably will weigh as much as he does, even if I don't have the street sideboard to show off my frizzy ponytail. Having declared my prejudice and my affection for America's favorite body stage and film hero, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare it as his worst film ever. I'm not sure he could make a film worse than that. <br /> <br /> In his defense the main problems of this film seem to occur in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this film should have had a different storyline. This translates into melancholic voices in which Steve's voice does not synchronize almost with that of the dubbed voice. Editing is pisspoor and overall this starts badly, it gets even worse, and eventually we wish you had rewatched the Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's so ugly. <br /> <br /> After this I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time you started taking a look at Van Damme directly into the nutritious DVD registers? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip the eyeballs and throw them in the toilet. A life of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
