I saw this movie last night and was a little disappointed. Many of the "facts of the time" were out. At the beginning of the film, his grandfather made a comment to this nephew and his friends about how they felt when he hit 9/11. This film should have taken place in 1994. In addition, one of his grandchildren was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNabb shirt. It had not yet been drafted until now. The plot was good but the facts and the timeliness of the time frame were so far from making the film seemingly vulgar. My boyfriend is an avid reader of books and memorabilia from World War II. I rented this movie hoping it would be nice. The acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was made made me happy to have only paid $ 4 to rent it out of the 50 that would have led me to see it in a theater. I hope that those who read this understand that I do not mean dissatisfaction with those who fought the war, but the facts and the calendar should have been a little more carefully monitored.
