Four Eyed Monsters follows the relationship of a shy and solitary videographer and a stranger in difficulty, who, living both in the Big Apple, develops an unlikely love story with the help of an Internet dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what it is, is their method of communication. By suppressing the report, they take notes and later communicate through the video. <br /> <br /> The film is based on the report of the creator (Arin Crumley and Susan Buice), who in addition to writing and directing, also accepts to play the main characters. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film is dispersed in the wind with an undecided structure set neatly between narcissism and self-indulgence. <br /> <br /> As the film wears, a brief separation and deterioration of their once intriguing form of communication grows old while the couple faces the discomfort of reality. Focusing exclusively on inner conflict or relationship problems, the film struggles through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor touching. This could easily be circumvented by adding a subplot and external conflict, and a third act, to which there is no one - just a montage of a melodrama that leads nowhere. <br /> <br /> What is even more aggravating is the descent of the film from history to reality that ends abruptly with an open and unsatisfactory ending. Everything would have been perfect and dandy, but there is no doubt or meaning to discover or meditate on. <br /> <br /> (The film contains a beautiful animation and a vivid and moving soundtrack, one of the most interesting aspects of the production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the film and you decide same.
