Just like last year's event, the 2006 WWE New Years Revolution was named after a Elimination Chamber match. However, the difference between the last few years and these years coincides with the value of entertainment. In reality, only three people had the chance to leave the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York, with the WWE championship. Those men were the current champion John Cena, Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels. There was no way Vinnie Mac put the belt on one of the rookies; Carlito or Chris Masters. And Kane? The last time Kane held the WWE championship in June 1998, it was only for one night. It was obvious that he wouldn't be the one himself. Last season was a compelling game with six of the best WWE has to offer. 2006 was a predictable and disappointing affair, but the game was by far the evening. <br /> <br /> The only surprise of the evening came after the bell was launched on the main event. He walked out to Vince McMahon and asked to lift the room. It was then announced that Edge was cashing his money in the bank's league game right there and there. With no time to prepare and immediately after winning the Elimination Chamber match, John Cena had no chance and left the title after a spear at one of the most enjoyable WWE heels. This was the only piece of fun action that happened all night. <br /> <br /> The undercard, like last year, was truly atrocious. Triple H and The Big Show celebrated the snoring that made me struggle to stay away. HHH won the victory, but was it never a real doubt? Any pay-per-view that has both Jerry Lawler and Viscera fighting on the same card will never have any chance of becoming a success. The King deployed Helms (who books this stuff?) And Big Vis tasted the defeat against the waste of Shelton Benjamin with a little help from his mom. <br /> <br /> WWE women also had a busy night. There was the usual nonsense of Diva with a match of Bra and Panties Gauntlet that was won by Ashley and also the Women's Championship was on the line. In one game, I thought he would be left to ferment until WrestleMania 22 Mickie James challenged Trish Stratus in a good game. Trish won the competition, but it is clear that it will continue for the near future. <br /> <br /> The opening contest of the evening will soon be WWE Champion Edge champion, Ric Flair. This could have been better but it was a battered and bloody Flair that remained after the disqualification ended. Edge obviously had a bigger fish to fry. <br /> <br /> So New Years Revolution kicked off the 2006 pay-per-view calendar disastrously. The only positive thing is to know that for the WWE the only way is to expire. They are not much worse than that.
