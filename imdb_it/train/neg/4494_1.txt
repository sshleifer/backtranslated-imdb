*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> From here on out, the whole movie collapses on itself. First we meet a rogue program with the indication that we will get ghosts and vampires and werewolves and the like. We get a guy with a delayed accent who talks about endless garbage, two "ghosts" that serve no purpose and have no character as always and a group of henchmen. Someone told me they are vampires (straight out of Blade 2), but they are so undefined that I didn't realize it. <br /> <br /> The funny guy with a ridiculous name suffers from the same problem as the oracle, only for much longer and much worse. He has a simple point about cause and effect, he does it, then he continues to do it and he does it until he becomes twisted and stupid. His final remark before leaving is comparable to that of Storm "you understand what happens to a toad ..." in X-men in levels of absolute insipidity. The chocolate cake is a clich√© so lazy and pathetic and Monica Bellucci like his wife does nothing but exactly what we expect when we see her. <br /> <br /> And then we take another kung fu battle !!! WHY? Neo is, presumably, The One. He can do anything. It has supreme power and what it uses it for. Kung bloody was all the time. And while it can stop 1000 bullets, it is still cut by a sword and still makes a meal for 5 indecipherable henchmen (vampires?). I wanted to see amazing powers. I wanted to see him do the craziest, the craziest fool for people because he can do anything. I had the same thing as before without the 'wow'. <br /> <br /> The fabulous car chase. It can't be bad. Well ... no, it's not. It is not just what we were that it would have been. ALL the fantastic shots of this scene are in the trailer. All. So everything probably Wow was taken from us so now all we get is a good chase sequence with, guess what, a kung fu fight !!! OK, it's not Neo, but you'd have thought he would explain the reality of the Matrix to his closest friends. At least he taught them something. It is not difficult. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morpheus, don't worry about what's going on in the matrix. It's not real. As long as you understand that nothing is real, nothing can really hurt you." <br /> <br /> Here it is. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, so the hunt is not bad. It is never boring and doesn't seem like 16 minutes. It's so overwhelming. Still, it gets worse. <br /> <br /> The final culmination of the film is probably the worst imaginable. They have this entire plan drawn up involving three crew members. Then they show it only sporadically in the long monologue of Morpheus. To make matters worse, they never clearly define what this plan is that requires 3 teams. You know in practice, but you don't know who is doing what, when, therefore, when one of the crew members goes down, you don't care and you don't know how this will affect what happens. <br /> <br /> I will summarize it however, it happens so that Trinity can return to the Matrix to set the end. This is the only reason why it happens. Which raises the question, why did they have to send 6 people originally? Trinity enters in five minutes alone! <br /> <br /> Neo's journey to the center of the Matrix (so to speak) is managed equally lazily. Ooohhh !!! He runs into another 100 Smith agents !!! Woooooo !!! This must have thought a lot. Only now am I in a corridor, so the battle has no dimensions and ends in an instant. Friend, what a great ending !!! <br /> <br /> And then the Architect !!! <br /> <br /> Remember all that I said was bad for the oracle and the foreign boy? Add them together and double them, that's what the Architect is really upsetting. The only reasonable potential of him is that he is going to create the peak climax. <br /> <br /> And then blow it up! <br /> <br /> Let's take a look at the options it offers to Neo. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27 !!!). Choose the other and humanity dies !!! Considering the choice is something that this film seeks to explore, in reality it does not give its hero. If he had a choice to save humanity and the lady dies or save the missus and kill humanity, there is the potential for inner torment and tension. Also, with Trinity in mid-autumn, the potential of a true cliffhanger that would have made seeing the third most essential. But no. He didn't save anyone or save the missus. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst thing about the original Matrix was Neo's death and then the return to life right at the end. The year they all came out they were so annoyed by how stupid Jar Jar hadn't realized that the end of The Matrix made him look like Steven Hawking. "The oracle told me that I would fall in love with Him and I love you" .... Come on !!!! How can the whole world have lost how terribly terrible it was? <br /> <br /> So what do the Wachowskis do in the sequel? Well, they make the finish of the original look better. Such as? Well, doing exactly the same thing again (exchanging only characters) only a lot worse, I think my FA and R keys would be consumed if I kept writing long before I got worse. <br /> <br /> And the cliffhanger isn't really a cliffhanger. It's a reminder. <br /> <br /> Basically, this movie is just bad. I really didn't want him to be bad, but he is. Bad in so many ways. And to make matters worse, this is not a movie with insufficient budget. It's not a movie with a program that is too short. It is not a film that was rushed. It is not a film in which too much influence comes from the outside. This is exactly the film that the Wachowskis decided to make with Warner's fortune behind them. And that's what makes this so terrible. At least Rancid Aluminum can say that it didn't have enough time or money. <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded. The worst movie ever made? Maybe not quite. The most disappointing and unlucky film ever made. <br /> <br /> Undeniably. <br /> <br />
