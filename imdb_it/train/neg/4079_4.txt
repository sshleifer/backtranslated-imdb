I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend who shares the same name as the ghost girl in this movie and enjoys films about the paranormal. The film was shot entirely in video, so it looks like a special PBS about it. The special effects are annoying, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that made us jump to our place. There is a particularly effective scare involving a statue of the Virgin Mary. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, the acting is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and I'll tell you I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
