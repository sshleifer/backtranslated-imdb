It's here. at the end a film comes out that, honestly, I can say that it's worse than Larry, the cable guy: health inspector. Yet I am willing to bet that the wayan brothers (hilarious) will earn more money than I've ever made in my life on what is sure to be one of the first five worst movies of all time, outside of my fifth elementary outside class re-enactment of Romeo and Juliet. I really mean WHY no one would ever see this movie unless they were paid. The comedy is weak and all the jokes even remotely amusing by the fragile plot have undoubtedly been revealed in the commercials. The last word is that this film was a terrible disappointment to me. And the ads looked so promising ...
