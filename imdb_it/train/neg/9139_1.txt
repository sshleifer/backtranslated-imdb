I don't know what it is in this film - director Sam Mraovich somehow messed up almost every little aspect of this movie. Normally I would say that this is a film that should not exist, but this film could be the most important of all time. This film should exist for the sole purpose of undoubtedly being "The worst movie ever made". I've seen bad movies in my life, but this somehow breaks what I consider bad into something much more difficult to imagine. <br /> <br /> Everything in this film is hilarious, but the funniest thing is that Mraovich himself considers this a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
