First of all, the CGI in this film was horrible. I saw it during a marathon of bad movies on the SciFi channel. In the end, when the park owner is killed, it's probably one of the worst examples of CGI I've ever seen. Even Night of the Living Dead had better animation. <br /> <br /> That said, the film has almost no plot. Why were they on that particular island? Well, it wasn't declared in the film. And why would people continue to enter the cat area? It does not make sense. <br /> <br /> One thing that stands out in this film was a moderately good acting. In what could be called a "B made for TV movie", the acting was very good. Parry Shen stood out in particular. <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely nothing to do on Saturday, watch this movie. It could be good for some memorable quotes.
