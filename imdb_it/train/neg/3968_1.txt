If you've ever seen a Brian Avenet-Bradley movie and compared it to the feedback it gets on IMDb, you know that most comments and votes are fake. Trust me: you will be bored! The people on the production team write their own feedback (sometimes they even admit it). But not enough: they also constantly click on "no" whenever there is a negative comment on the film. That's why negative critics are always placed behind those they advertise. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! Otherwise, you'll believe me later! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley could be a good businessman. Otherwise it cannot be explained that you find people who still fund your films. (Okay, they're cheap, but anyway.) But as a creative person, it's a complete failure.
