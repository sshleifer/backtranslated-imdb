Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which turns him into a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after attacking his wife and his treacherous lover, and is later picked up by a scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground mental hospital populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments. <br /> <br /> After learning about Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I searched through my collection for a movie to watch. In my run, I discovered I had not one but three (!) Copies of "Fury of the Wolfman". The film is of questionable video quality, the sound is nicknamed mediocre, cinematography is a kind of slapstick style sometimes. And the American versions have removed two love scenes. Frankly, without a remastered and uncut copy, I wasn't really getting the right film in all its glory. <br /> <br /> This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect it's true, but you wouldn't know from the movie itself. Sometimes the plot is confusing and there is really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what's printed on the box, you'll see that I'm not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the shortcomings of the film can be forgiven if we understand the hell of production that it has gone through. While floating for years, it was released only in 1973, due to problems related to the search for a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those really aren't light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza said in his name. <br /> <br /> It is likely that, sooner or later, you will come across a low-level version of "Fury". of the werewolf ". Appears in a variety of three packs and box sets, so you could accidentally buy it and not even know it. What really needs to happen is an untrimmed American version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the scenes of love thrown in. As far as I know, this does not exist. We honor the legacy of Paul Naschy and bring his films to a wider audience with a level of quality that he deserves.
