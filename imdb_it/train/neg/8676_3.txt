Avoid the US version. It is with the addition of US footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard, probably done by New York amateurs. The dubbing is so bad that it looks like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black boy from the Bronx makes the voice of Chiba. I couldn't see the whole movie that was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, look at other Chiba greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
