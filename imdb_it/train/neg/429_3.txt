I was attracted to seeing this movie from his starpower, but in the end it's all he offers. It looks much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about the corruption of the big city. The biggest flaw is predictability and the absolute lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and we continue to follow them as they fall like dominoes. The film to his credit refrains from gratuitous violence and sex, but he has forgotten to replace in any other way a clean or romantic love story. All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated coke. "Q & A", which also takes place in New York, is a much better alternative, as is "LA Confidential".
