One wonders if at any time in the production of this film there was a script of type <br /> that made sense. The approximate cut was 3 hours long <br /> <br /> and was trimmed in the incoherent disorder that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone finance this casino? I will say that Tom <br /> Wlaschiha is a good-looking young man and does what he can <br /> <br /> with dialogue and the dramatic (?) Situations he is given. But <br /> <br /> the characters come and go for no apparent reason, the continuity is <br /> <br /> non-existent, and the acting, cinematography and direction are (for <br /> <br /> put it politely) amateur. Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate <br /> <br /> choice of title that will probably prove false if someone <br /> <br /> actually tried to actually watch this movie.
