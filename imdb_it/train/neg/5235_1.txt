I can almost understand why some people would like to underline the connection of this film with the eighties, but in reality I would not say that it is an accurate representation of the life of most people at that time, even in the poorest Bradford properties. However, it is typical of the blunt junk of the agitprop that the dear old Royal Court Theater was churning out at the time. Plenty of "right" artistic skills for small, small spectators, but enough well-connected backslapping to guarantee future commissions for the turgid playragon. The simple fact is that if you want to reflect on a more real common experience, you will find millions of others who nod in knowing the agreement to love and live as described in "Gregory's Girl". <br /> <br /> I would be tempted to define this drama as a "kitchen sink", but this would do a great disservice to the hydraulic industry. However, as far as a decent script is concerned, this film is really all washed. For some reason he has amassed a strange following among the guardians who watch the film - I can only assume that they get a visual effect to pretend to degrade it. Avoid my friends. It is a poor film with a poor screenplay that likes to think that boundaries are breaking adding humorous insights to the sad life of properties. it's not ... but it's sad. Instead wash the dishes.
