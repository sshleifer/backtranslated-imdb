An actor asks, "What is my motivation?" To understand his character. After seeing this "docudrama", this vague and casual farce, a viewer wonders what the motivation of anyone has been. <br /> <br /> This inept offspring of daytime TV (the Oprah show) lost by a mile a great opportunity to explore heavy problems. <br /> <br /> His characters were all superficial and superficial, his plot much less socially redeeming than an episode of "Simpson". He described the police for investigation as unprofessional and incompetent. He failed to explain why the court could treat the main character, a female molester, so differently than a male would. <br /> <br /> Why did this unrepentant woman start to "govern" her second grade student, start a relationship with him when he returned to the sixth class? Why did the child's mother testify in his name? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, in addition to generational rationalization and greed. The film gave no hint of this. <br /> <br /> Why did the viewer fail to inform that the victim's mother sold the interview rights to the press and television tabloids, parading her teenage son on "The Today Show"? Mary Kay's lawyer cashed in, did she herself call a "Son of Sam" charter so that she could benefit from her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder? <br /> <br /> Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right-wing Republican deputy, the 1972 American independent presidential candidate, the president of the John Birch Society? In 1983 did John Schmitz's political career end when he was discovered to have had children by his own university student, exposed only when that lady sexually mutilated their newborn son? Yet had Letourneau's father removed his numerous children from "too liberal" Catholic schools, fighting to prevent all schoolchildren from receiving any sex education? <br /> <br /> One month after her conditional release, again 14 years pregnant - -old's second daughter, Mary Kay received 7 and a half years in prison for numerous probation violations. A prophetic editorial about the sad story then appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two miserable hours, LeTourneau was taken to prison, and this salacious melange of filmmaking made for TV was over until the start of the casting. " <br /> <br /> Sure enough, 18 months later, the filming of this disguise was underway.
