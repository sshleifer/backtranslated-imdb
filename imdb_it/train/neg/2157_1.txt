Siskel & Ebert were fantastic on this show, regardless of whether you consented or not because of the real conflict generated by their separate professional opinions. Roeper carried out this show of two or three places because he was not a film critic and because he replaced the fake for the opinionated. Now, when Ben Lyons arrives, I feel like I'm watching "Teen News" - you know, that children's news program hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have only encountered a constant diet of traditional films throughout their lives. The idea that these two amateurs have something interesting or consequently to say about movies is ridiculous. If they are reviewing an unformulated film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they simply find it "confused". Wait - I think I understand ... The ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney creates films for children. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper have promoted independent films and have been just a hit-or-miss with big budget studio productions, what a surprise: these two LOVE the big schlock studio and can only tolerate a few indies. Also, everyone knows the age range that TV advertisers are targeting. The obvious nepotism is the icing on the cake. In which alternative universe do these guys qualify as film critics?
