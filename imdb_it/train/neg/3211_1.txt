And it fits perfectly into the "incredibly bad" category, which is a film that drunk students would rent to get a kick. I was at the science fiction festival and all I remember is a wave of hysterical laughter as this film was premiered. Other criticisms will better describe the fecal nature of this film, and I really felt so bad for the poor guy in the production company who had shown up, obviously to assess the public's reaction. What he got was the science fiction equivalent of a drunk student audience, and after a "serious" anime film, I think it was "blue sky", the audience was in a dark mood, and then this movie opened and in a few all seconds the room was rolling in the islands. I will discover the worst parts: <br /> <br /> Script: The funniest and worst part of this movie, winds its way on a linear and predictable road with the occasional misunderstanding aside. Garbage, but eminently ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Animation: badly done, and put together, if you can stand faded backgrounds and gradually simpler costumes for heroin (I know I can!), So be careful the editing where "turns" from a Swedish peasant in LADY DEATH !!! <br /> <br /> Characters: So one-dimensional is painful, there is a brief backstory (with lines of breaking dialogues) and little light is illuminated by the real motivations that underlie some of the main characters. <br /> <br /> So, in a nutshell, if you have a captive audience and some drinks around (try and make sure they are) re alcoholic to ease the pain), then insert this movie into the DVD and enter a mentality of the "mystery science theater 3000". There is no other reason to watch this film except to laugh at it, and it is not meant to be a comedy. DO NOT LOOK AT THIS FILM ALONE. It might be even more boring to look alone at "New World" with Colin Farrell because you won't be able to laugh at a friend or two.
