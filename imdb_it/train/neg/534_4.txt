This shit is like looking at dry paint. I'm so disappointed because I was so anxious to see it. <br /> <br /> There is simply no meaning in this film. If it had never been done, no one would have noticed or cared for it. It is advertised because of all the big names in it, but if "no one" was, no one would have given this movie any love. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I was at the point where in the middle of the movie I was watching Vanessa Redgrave and thought, "Hurry up and die already!" This is like the "Joy Luck Club" without any of the crazy joys. It's the "Ocean's 13" (nothing but a cast of big names) of mother-daughter and completely anti-climatic films ... oh until it's finally finished. <br /> <br /> I'm sure they'll all be nominated for the Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to engage in this junk.
