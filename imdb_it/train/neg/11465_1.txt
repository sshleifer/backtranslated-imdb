Without a doubt, this is one of the worst photos I have ever paid to see - the kind of movie you choose out of desperation at the mall's cinema during the Christmas holidays when you have missed starting times for something good but are still dead start to see a movie! And that's exactly how I came to see this stinky bomb ... <br /> <br /> At the distance of the best part of thirty years I can still smell the rotten fish that makes up this plot. Incredible plot - that a deadly whale bears a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is ridiculous. And that's all, except for a completely misplaced "love theme" that plays on the end of a film devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is adorable (in a two-dimensional role) but Richard Harris just chews the landscape. He was not a Quint captain (Robert Shaw) and this is not a "Jaws". Fortunately, I put most of it out of my mind and when I met him on television I moved immediately. "Danger, Will Robinson!" See the current t.v. advertising showing husband and wife watching whales ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - at least it ended in sixty seconds. This film represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never return to.
