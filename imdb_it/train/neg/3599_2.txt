Umm .. I was quite surprised that someone really gave this movie a high score. <br /> <br /> Let's face it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this film only demonstrates the extent of his "talent" ". The plot of the film was weak ... I bet the fool that he invented this concept was a pervert peeping tom.If there is a good thing about this film, I would say that it is Tommy Chong's daughter, just because she is his daughter ... and then there is that male leader of Soap-Opera-ish that looks good that makes it quite attractive, but ceases to help its dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many other ways can you just say "This movie sucks"?
