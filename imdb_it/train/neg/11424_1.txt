I noticed that "Fire" was on the air the other night and I started watching it because I couldn't remember anything specific about it, apart from the fact that I remember it was a horrible movie when I saw it in 85 . Twenty years later the film is still terrible. In addition to the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument of pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Listening to that song again made me want to stick a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic suffering inflicted on them. And to add to this musical assault, Rob Lowe's character played the saxophone, and there was a scene where he played a solo that went on and on like Charlie Parker, only his high-pitched tone and playing sounded more a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unattractive, although I must say that they did a great job of throwing equally unpleasant actors to portray them. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was attractive and initially I felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but then towards the end of the film she decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character who would probably be voted more likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if this thing was voted on.
