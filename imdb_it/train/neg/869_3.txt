Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I'd say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and for anyone else who had free time and an extra penny (mind you that it was the price I paid, taken by Wal-Mart), this movie had to be a thriller. The only thrill I had was to see the disgusting representation of Kirkland by Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy forest area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to see something at least halfway decent, then don't worry either. <br /> <br /> For me, bad movies are the best in most cases. But Wow ... I meant WOW !! The only person in the whole movie who didn't stink it was the kid, played by Vincent Berry. The only reason I even gave it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
