This is the first review of the non-zombie subgenre made but this film deserves to be reviewed. Dinocroc is a good film in general, but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. The same Dinocroc looked fantastic but I thought that the film needed a little more weight as in action and violence because every time the croc is shown or in a fight scene not much happens except that the croc is shown and the croc kills or runs away in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was warm, which is an advantage and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of a cartoon cough * komodo * cough curse. I liked this movie enough to be happy that there will be a sequel that is more than I can say about some films in general. Altogether 3/6 stars and deserves a watch.
