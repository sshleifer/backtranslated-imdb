I'm a fan of the series and I've read all 7 books. I wanted to see it just to see how it was done. All I can say is that the only people who should watch this are those who have already read the series and are curious about it. It's pretty ugly, and it will take you away reading them. Not to be bad, but Lucy is so ugly that she takes the film away. Was she the directors' daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the film's beavers were jealous of his teeth. He had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame. The film loses so much in translation. The CS books do not translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books, or even Harry Potter books. <br /> <br /> Something they did well! Aslan! very well done. Although the other human actors with painted faces (beavers, wolves) seem silly, Aslan was really well done since he wasn't just a human actor going around. (I suppose it's like the old horse keeper? 2 people in?) Besides, I'd be curious about what children think of this movie. Perhaps they would appreciate it? But as for adults, the safe bet will not, even if they are CS fans.
