This was one of the worst movies EVER !!!!!!!! It was so bad, I was laughing through the film ALL! The plot was SO poor; especially at the end This film goes from disaster to the end of the world to save eels! I mean come on! And I swear ... I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for eels! And there was this horrible kissing scene in the middle with the two main characters who had been divorced. How predictable! It was so terrible that my mother, my sister and I couldn't finish it, and when we finished it, it was about a year later! The second time we watched it and this time we finished it, we made similar comments to MST3K throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Summary: look only if you are a movie fanatic! Make hilarious comments, look at this in a slumber party to laugh, and I mean HUGE laughter. Look also for mockery. The metaphor that explains this film: This film is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets!
