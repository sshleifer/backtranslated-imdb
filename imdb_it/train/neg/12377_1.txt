Just because someone is under 10 doesn't mean they're stupid. If your child likes this movie, you'd better test it. I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that is so serious. This "film" is a showcase for digital magic and NOTHING OTHER. The writing is horrible. I can't remember when I heard such a bad dialogue. The songs are beyond miserable. The acting is sub-par but then not much has been given to the actors. Who decided to hire Joey Fatone? He cannot sing and is as ugly as sin. <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the obviousness of it all. It is as if the writers did everything to make everything as stupid as possible. Great films for children are evil, intelligent and full of spirit - films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, Willie Wonka and The Witches to name two of the past. But in the continuous American dumbing-down, others are crowding like Finding Nemo (yes, it's true), the recent Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the garbage that crosses the eyes like Red Riding Hood.
