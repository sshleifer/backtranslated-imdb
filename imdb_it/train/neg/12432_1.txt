This is the worst repugnance of the Home Alone movies I've ever seen! Look at parts 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two! I mean, really, you don't make a movie, then you make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then do another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors! I mean, it would have been OK if this wasn't a "Home Alone" movie, but they did a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old now, so suppose we stop making sequels! Goodness, this film makes me SICK! Buy part 1 and 2.
