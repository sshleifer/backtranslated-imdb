This movie is terrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I can't even imagine that Gigli is worse than this. The previews made us say "NO", but then looking for something in the dreck right now, we decided to go ahead and give us a shot. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. It is an image and can look good with explosions, but not even the type Bruce Willis got in "Die Hard". If he took off his shirt and ran to fight the bad guys, it would have been a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini lets himself go again (if it weren't for the Sopranos, he would have been washed) as in "The Mexican". <br /> <br /> Affleck plays every scene and as others have said - no character has any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.
