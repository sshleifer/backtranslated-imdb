I appreciate the need to hire strangers for this type of "horror" film, but they should at least hire some suitable actors. Especially the sergeant is guilty of using his monotonous bulldozer on every single line he has. But let's face it, the lines are not really important. There is no truly recognizable plot, so most of the writing includes the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** re other ugly assorted languages ​​instead of an appropriate dialogue . <br /> <br /> The "story" as it is, is mostly composed of apparently random blood and death, with a couple of worthwhile "surprises" that happen about 10 minutes after seeing exactly what's going on to happen. Not only that, but there are many dazzling holes in the plot and errors of continuity (why are they going in there? Didn't he have a weapon? He wasn't dead?), So it makes the whole movie look like it was shot down by the several hours it took to fix them. <br /> <br /> Another film that is simply based on blood and blood instead of any real cinematic experience.
