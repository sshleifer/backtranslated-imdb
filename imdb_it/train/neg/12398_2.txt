Look, it's the third, so you already know it's bad. And "Maniac Cop" wasn't good enough to warrant the second episode, so you know it's even worse. But how much worse? Terrible, approaching God-horrible. <br /> <br /> When Maniac Cop makes a murderous binge, a journalist exclaims: "What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death." <br /> <br /> 1-- Rainbows are not black and can never be. 2 - Rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death. 3 - A journalist, a precious one for his agency, could find another way to describe the consequences of a murderous madness. "A black rainbow of death" is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation. <br /> <br /> This is what you like.
