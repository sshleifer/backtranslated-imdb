I gave it a purely four out of its historical context. It was considered lost for many years until it appeared unexpectedly on Showtime in the early nineties. <br /> <br /> Moe is the straight man and Larry and Curly act like a duo. Spade Cooley has a couple of numbers. I guess it has something to do with working on a ranch. I'm not entirely sure why the plot was so minimal that nothing remained in my memory. I vaguely remember that it is a Western musical comedy. Even the Stooges seem to go through the movements. In general there is really not much to recommend here. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Stooge fan, don't worry. If you are a fan of Stooge, then stick with the shorts.
