I tried to watch this movie twice and even at that time quickly forward the irritating parts, but I still couldn't make it to the end. <br /> <br /> I don't understand how this movie * really * got good reviews. I think these people who give such good reviews are just trying to beat the movie for marketing purposes. Their reviews seem very unrealistic and seem like an internal work, which makes things more painful. Movies should receive real positive comments on their own and not invented !! <br /> <br /> The acting is reminiscent of a cheese porn film, and not in a fun way. I don't care about cheap movies with bad acting if they know how to work with them. <br /> <br /> I found the main character irritating. His facial expressions and humor were unbearably childish. I thought it was intentional to make the women's conspiracy more fun and grounded, but they were even worse. <br /> <br /> The script was also very embarrassing (his bosses exaggerated with the business talk) and the sarcastic and unpleasant comments. <br /> <br /> I have found nothing of salvation on this film except for some attractive women. <br /> <br /> I never thought a valuation was misleading. I was interested in his premise, but afraid of everything else. Sure, see if you want, but I didn't want anyone else to hope and waste their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
