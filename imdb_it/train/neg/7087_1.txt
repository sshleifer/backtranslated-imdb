Normally I wouldn't write a comment online, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only was it shot as a series of soap ("The young and the restless" is actually turned by professionals compared to this), but it also has terrible cuts. It has no action. It's full of useless trash. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the main character while he is fired because of him. So (after a lot of bullshit) here they are: the guy puts a knife to his throat and says something like "You're dead now". Then the protagonist says: "If you kill me you are dead, I told the police that you are threatening me". So the guy (killer) goes like (he's about to cry): "Oh no ... the cops are following me !? !! Oh ... my God". <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can't believe this movie really exists. So: IF you want to see the worst movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
