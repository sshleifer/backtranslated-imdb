I also like Dafoe as an actor, but I have wasted a few hours of my life watching this film, I still can't believe that I managed to see it in its entirety. Was there really a point in the film, and the ending, well, I'm glad I never paid to see this horrible useless piece of pathetic excuse for a movie! I'm not sure without trying the facts out but Dafoe got married or saw the horrible actress in this movie in real life, if it was such an attempt to start her career? If so I fear it must have failed .. <br /> <br /> I post this in the hope of actually being able to put someone out by watching this film, even if 1 person pays attention to my comments and decides I'd rather watch drying of painting I will feel I have done good in the world, if only I had had the same advice ...
