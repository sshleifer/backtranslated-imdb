Terrible movie made with a budget of around $ 9.99. Set of very obvious miniatures used, poor acting and a horrible plot of aliens who use the meat discarded from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. The film contains blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an egg beater that replaces one of his hands. (Yes you read that right.) <br /> <br /> One redeeming thing was a song performed at the "talent show" (how is it for irony?) From a punk / new wave band that I think was called " I am a missile that looks for heat ". Besides this, this is not worth your time, not even on a "so bad is good" level. See if you like alien cheese films, but everyone else should be careful. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
