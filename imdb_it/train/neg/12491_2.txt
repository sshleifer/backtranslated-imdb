Hm. While a funny movie to hit the holes in the plot, highlights atrocious, primitive (at best) special effects (everyone showed me this movie three times in the last six years), Severed is among the worst I've ever seen . I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the murder scene on the dance floor. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are fun, the rest is a mixture of dialogues and confusing images that can't bring the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway).
