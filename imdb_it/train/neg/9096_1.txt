I think this is probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the 'same characters' with different people is * a * bad idea. If they couldn't get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this case, they would have to cut their losses and say heck. Instead they get new actors who are horrible in what they did. I seriously felt I was in a high school or a (bad) college playing with the acting lever of these people. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was this their first movie? It seemed so. <br /> <br /> This film is also parallel to the original in some ways. I had just finished watching the first one and opened the n. 2. I was excited to see the second film, which was the worst show I've seen in a while. I almost never NEVER * NEVER * turn off a movie, but this certainly went away after about 30 to 40 minutes.
