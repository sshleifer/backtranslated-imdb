This is much worse than those horrible cartoons by Laurel and Hardy from the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple fights of a resurrection of Stan and Ollie. A new audience has rediscovered the comic genius of the couple and the cartoons have been nightmare junk designed to capture children's interest. It was to be expected. But, even as you try to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the producers hoped that it would somehow inspire another resurgence of Laurel and Hardy, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a superficial and unpleasant caricature of what made the original so attractive. The Impressionists (hesitate to call them actors) make an act of Vegas and that's where it belongs. The plot is even more insubstantial than that used in the old days, trying to extend the two-wheeled ideas to a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I am sure the viewer would have denied the reputation of the original duo when senility had become insecure. The only film that I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. And, you know, these filmmoppers pretty much did the same thing to Stan and Ollie.
