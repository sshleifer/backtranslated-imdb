First of all, if you're a fan of comics, well, you'll be VERY disappointed, I'm sure! Low budget movies !!! Largo should be Serbian in the comic, now suddenly he becomes Croatian, pfff! chicken producers, gave the comic a little spice and courage (by the way, in the film, his father speaks in Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). The imposing building of the Y. Winch becomes a medium-small size yacht in H.K. The handsome Largo becomes an unshaved tchigan / boy with a Turkish appearance. Freddy, the friendly "scarface" pilot, becomes a fat boy, out of shape, sad and normal. Largo's dear friend Simon does not exist at all! He gave it some pepper! Largo does not throw knives at all, but only a few fixed snakes ... The whole story is confusing and looks like a pretentious television movie. French directors and producers, if you don't have the money, the skill or the technology to properly adapt the comic, please stick to some love stories shot in Paris. Very bad film, good thing I just rented it, don't count on me to watch the sequel (if there is one!).
