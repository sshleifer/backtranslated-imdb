Totally forgettable. Especially because of weak acting. This is the first movie I saw with Dax Shepard. To my surprise, it's been around since the late 1990s. I thought he was a newcomer, since his acting was so insignificant. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Even though I saw her doing well in other films, she gave Clare Cooper a strange personality. Liv is not the kind of actress who will give the character a fiery and emotional personality as Diane Keaton would be able to do, but it was rather strange to see her pronounce her lines in whispering mode. It seemed that overall there was simply no good chemistry between the actors, and I think Diane Keaton also perceived it. She is a fantastic actress, but she seemed a bit exaggerated in this film. He seemed to want to get this movie as soon as possible. I wouldn't blame her.
