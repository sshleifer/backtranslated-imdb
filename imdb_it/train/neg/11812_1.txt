... but I'm not one of them. Dear Diary was at least watchable for two-thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third section of that film gave us a taste of what was going to happen in this extraordinarily self-indulgent chaos. Moretti says he feels the need to make this film, but he doesn't want it, while the viewer feels he should keep it, but he doesn't really want to. A film about politics and the Italian elections could be fascinating, but this is not the film. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside, but it is typical of this film that we have never seen anything about them . Interpreted by Moretti's political delusions are the events that led to the birth of his son, and subsequent home movie shots of him with the child and later the child Pietro (the film drags us through several years and over a period of time) electoral). We continue to expect to see some definitive sequences or convincing arguments, but they never arrive. For a doubt, I might have the patience to sit down again in a Nanni Moretti film. He manages to make an hour and twenty minutes seem an eternity.
