Finally I could take a look at this experimental Lynch after waiting so long ... and unfortunately it wasn't worth it! Even for a passionate Lynch fan, I found that this is really boring .... <br /> <br /> nothing happens, there are long, long, painful pauses where nothing happens, long, monotonous speeches in which nothing is said and everything ends with the viewer who does not know, or worries, what the hell was going on, what happened before and what happened next. <br /> <br /> There was a reference to Mulholland Drive - the blonde girl and the dark girl were very Diane and Rita-sque, and a moment of Lost Highway with allusions to some significant event that happened but didn't can speak clearly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's all very uninteresting and very boring, nothing happens, it's very forgettable and I think I'll delete it from my computer and I'll forget I've ever seen it. Sorry, David!
