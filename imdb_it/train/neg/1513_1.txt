The Flock is not really a movie. It is an inspirational film, with aspiring actors. Apart from Richard Gere, he gave an excellent performance, but when only one of the actors really gives himself up to his character, and the rest of the cast is just acting ... the result is pathetic, just like this movie. See, the idea of ​​acting is hiding the fact that you are acting. What the hell was Claire Dains doing in this ?! She is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film it seemed extremely out of place, out of everything !! The only thing he was doing was asking stupid questions, like "do you really think so?" And make silly faces. I was embarrassed by his acting, seriously, and I liked it ... You are the kind of romantic movie, I don't know who chose it from all the actresses out there ... LOL, and see Avril Lavigne ?! this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to have the feeling of vomiting, this movie will do the job for you !!! I wish I could vote -5 ..
