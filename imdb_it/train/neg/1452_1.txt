This Germany from 1919 to 1933 does not resemble a post-World War II Czech capital. Oh sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's 2003, that's fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most terrible films in history in the nearest past. Röhm is a taller head than Adolf and looks so damn good, Göring looks 40 when he is just 23 and the "Führer" always looks like 56. And sometimes buildings, people, even buildings were young. Especially in 1919 there were many houses in Germany almost new (the First World War did not reach the German cities!). No crumbling plaster! So the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, ever. And this may seem like a miracle to all of you: in 1933 the big Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines, some even with swivel ladders, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> last thing: what kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this in the final sequence? For me this was kind of "Adolf's Adventures in Wonderland"
