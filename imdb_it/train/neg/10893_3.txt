This is one of those movies that should have been better than the one that turned out. I'm terrified of thinking about what the Blockbuster-approved change should be, because the director's DVD movie was boring with epic proportions. Of course, you don't expect it to be "The Godfather", but an acting class or two might be useful to you. <br /> <br /> Also, there were so many nice guys in this movie, but they were sadly underused. I like to watch a flock of hotties writhing in their BVDs as much as their neighbors, but I also have the right to expect a little more. It wasn't a total loss, though; at least we saw a junk (blanket) by Drew Fuller and a really shocking haircut. And there is Huntley Ritter who looks even prettier than he did in "Bring It On" (and plays just as well). There is always a positive side, children. You just have to look really hard. And occasionally, you have to use your pause button.
