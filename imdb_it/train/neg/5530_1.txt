Among the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on VHS for a cable television channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually built a much longer film and then shot it down for a standard theatrical vision. How much longer? to fill all the holes in the plot, as we have, would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially considering that the film we have is so slow and takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> It is puzzling; what could Halperin have tried to accomplish here? Their previous film, "White Zombie", was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate the first monstrous films of Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as such approached the mythology of the zombies than those of the North America would have known from popular magazines. <br /> <br /> The zombie revolt, on the contrary, seems to have been intended as an allegory for the politics of modern warfare. This would not only explain the openness, and the change in the character of Dean Jagger in a megalomaniac, but also explains why the zombies don't really do much in the film, besides standing up, looking scary, and waiting for orders - they "are only allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals that we all came to love and hate in zombie movies.I'm equal to any in my dislike of modern warfare and its politics - but I think the film should be fun before, and only later, perhaps, educational. And surely - a zombie movie should relate to the zombies. <br /> <br /> Truly one of the most bizarre films in the history of Hollywood, but not one that could recommend, even for historical value.
