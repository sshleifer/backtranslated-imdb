I have absolutely no knowledge of the author Phillipa Pearce or any of his novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of his work I probably would have had little interest in his books as a child. When I was a child I was not very interested in litreture unless there were soldiers who fought monsters complete with a large number of people <br /> <br /> Judging by this film version of TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN` that Pearce writes to lower middle-class children, as much of the story revolves around the protagonist Tom Long who moves into a house without a garden, suddenly finding himself metaphysical. Having a garden all by itself was undoubtedly something the working class people did not have in the 1950s, so I believe there is a subtext driven by the political class somewhere. There is also a love story that involves a girl named Hattie, but again are cynical children loved by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that in reality the excitement or adventure occurs in the story. <br /> <br /> This is a children's movie that seems dated to its source. It is harmless, but I am surprised by the high rating of IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given so many high marks if they had 10 years that they had just seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy?
