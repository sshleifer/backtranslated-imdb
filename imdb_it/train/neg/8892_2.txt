I must admit that this version dishonors Shakespeare in advance! No one can act except the nurse who was my favorite! Juliet has had good adolescent abilities, but she can't give emotional depth to her jokes and we can't really connect to her. It's getting worse when he's thinking about drinking the sleep potion ... God stop whining! I would have poured it into my mouth to silence it! Anthony Andrews ... hey! Considering his other great films (Brideshead Revisited, Ivanhoe, Scarlet Pimpernel), it's pretty shocking in this. And don't get me started on Romeo ... puhleasssssee! It's still nice to see if you are looking to see all the Romeo and Juliet ever made in the film's history. Olivia and Leonard's version is still the best, followed by Leslie Howard's version and current Leo and Clare!
