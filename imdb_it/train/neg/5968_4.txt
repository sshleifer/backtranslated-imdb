If this film was more about the character of Piper Perabo and less about the bar, this could have been halfway decent. Piper's Violet Stanford and Karen Friendly (The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle) both have a virgin teacher quality that is appealing to them. I hope he will find a better movie to be in.
