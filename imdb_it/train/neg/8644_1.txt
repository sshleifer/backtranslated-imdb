This is a complete hoax ... <br /> <br /> The film was filmed clearly in the Indian state of Rajasthan, in northwest India. Watch the chase scene: the vehicles are Indian; writing everywhere is Hindi - language used in India. The journey through the typical streets of Jaipur. The palace is also located in Amer, about 10 miles from Jaipur, in Rajasthan. Directors in their (on the film) DVD Bonus seem to make it seem like they risked their lives by shooting in and around Kabul. Almost all the action scenes are shot in India. The scene in which they see a band singing around the fire is so fake that they didn't even think about changing it with the popular Afghan song. They have just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. How do I know because I traveled in that area in depth. I'm just on the bandwagon to do great things on the issue. I challenge the directors to deny it.
