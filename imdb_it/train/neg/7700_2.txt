I saw the movie last night here at home, but I thought it was too long first of all. Secondly, the things I saw in the movie were too out of text to even have what I thought would be a comedy-like film like the rest before. Things are not fun in the movie: the boyfriend who hits his girlfriend, the beatings. The film was too long - talk about wanting to go to sleep and wonder when it will end when you wake up and you will continue to do so! Some of the things at the meeting were too much to capture - like the singer - I felt like I was attending a spiritual song show here! come on Perry, you can do better then!
