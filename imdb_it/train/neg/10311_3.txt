SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes his usual hard / handsome guy, and his future life, ex Kathleen Kinmont, is Alexa's ass. OJ Simpson is a detective, who is wandering around for his missing public genius. Translation: cable TV filler. There is not enough skin to qualify it as a Guilty Pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has gaps. Best / worst moment: in a shaky scene, OJ's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue. OJ replies that some of the bodies are rather hot, or words to that effect. This vague reference to necrophilia is quite offensive; but in light of the murders committed shortly after the release of this film, it's really scary, and therefore unintentionally and horribly funny. I was so surprised that I laughed until the champagne came out of my nose. Now it's a guilty pleasure. B. C
