This grainy film has a cult following and one of those features you've just seen. Perhaps it's hard to believe, but there is a rural community in southwestern Arkansas, Fouke, who knows that the legend is true. This story is told in documentary style narrated by Vern Stierman and filmed in real places talking to real people involved. The legend changes with the story, but during the late 1960s and most of the 1970s the surrounding area of ​​Fouke was visited by a Bigfoot-like creature traveling along Boggy Creek. Long limbed with three fingers and over 7 feet tall, this shaggy creature periodically caused damage and scared the "bejeebers" out of most of the community. Personally I crossed the small bridge of Boggy Creek in 1974, and yes the hair on my neck got up. Obviously it was about 1am in the rain. When I arrived in Shreveport, I was laughing.
