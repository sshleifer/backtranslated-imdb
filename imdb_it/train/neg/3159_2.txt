Sorry guys, I've already written my opinion on this movie but today was the first day I looked at some of the other reviews. There are a lot of people who agree with me, but what is scary is that there are some people who seem to like this movie. I don't like writing unpleasant reviews or criticizing other people's opinions, but I think it's fair to warn anyone out there that they could discuss whether or not to see this movie. This is not a good movie. I really like movies and I will watch anything, but this film has entered the incredibly short list of films I've seen and was happy to leave halfway through. If you're really incredibly tempted, watch the trailer ... it's the mistake I made because the whole movie is essentially in the trailer ... after that there are no surprises, just some upsetting dialogues to waste time. I love Michael Vartan in Alias ​​and I'd hate to criticize him, but I think it's my duty to stop other people who waste hours of their lives in a movie like this !!
