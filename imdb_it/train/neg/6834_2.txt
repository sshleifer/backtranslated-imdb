Damn, what the heck of a movie! ... I said that I wanted to become a specialist in bad movies for decades, so I decided to start from this. It was a fairly adequate choice. I entered this adventure to find some lost gems and incomplete masterpieces, but I didn't see anything like it in this pastel mess. I've never seen many bad films before, but I have the feeling that this is what it's called "so bad it's okay", probably because it's so unintentionally damn funny! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are inaccuracies related to the plot, physical inaccuracies and even psychological inaccuracies. The latter, in particular, are as crazy as Van Damme's ass cheeks in that blue band. There are also extremely sticky lines and I won't even start talking about some of the hilarious action actions. There is not exactly a bad acting by all those involved in that hot film mess, except in one particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic like Frank, who is an absolutely stupid character. And actually, I was really very surprised to see that Van Damme did a good job with the twins. He managed to get a different tone and mood in the two roles that convinced me. But the film was for the most part very ugly and the sad part is that it was produced by a major film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
