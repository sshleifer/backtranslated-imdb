I'm a Columbo fan, especially on a rainy Saturday, and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451, but this episode was very lacking. The plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed in advance, even years before today's modern detective shows. But it was fun to see the crazy models of sofas and "modern" electronic equipment and, of course, the obligatory suburban humor that mocks modern art for sales. The high-tech house is a Jetson or Disney version of Tomorrowland, and fun to think of the writers who invent those "way-out gadgets". <br /> <br /> If it's sunny outside, go play, because there are much better episodes of Columbo. However, we should be grateful to Cable TV for these episodes to be broadcast.
