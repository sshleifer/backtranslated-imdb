I wonder how much this film actually has to do with the 1984 film "Bachelor Party", with Tom Hanks. Is this film also an official sequel? This film is lacking in every department and obviously it's better not to watch it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy this film is simply not good or fun enough. It is mainly based on the stereotyped evaluations of the character, rather than the film actually presents some good, original and funny moments. <br /> <br /> Of course there is also a small present story and the naked breast of the film compared to the script pages. You are simply waiting for things to finally begin. There is a main plot line somewhere, but that one is so terribly unoriginal and runs so badly in the movie that it looks more like something non-existent. I imagine there is also a message and a moral story somewhere, but this is again so terribly unoriginal and badly done in the film that it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> It is basically a typical adolescent comedy, with lots of jokes about sex and nudity, only without the teenage protagonists, which makes the story even more sad and insipid. The film makes really wrong jokes, which are misplaced for any type of film. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I never saw it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
