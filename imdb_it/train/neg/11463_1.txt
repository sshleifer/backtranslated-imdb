This is just an answer to yahoo which says that this film is more realistic than the classic genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, the brain, the great whites (and other species of shark, bull, black tip, oceanic white tip, tiger) are known to populate areas where it is easy to find prey. Humans often can't do it on that menu, but the shark in the film has been repeatedly reported to show abnormal behavior. It is not as if it never happened. The chances of a killer whale that destroys almost an entire city, identifying a human nemesis, sinking several dozen North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned "nemesis", are close enough to the water for it to reach, they are so skinny they are ridiculous. Very similar to this Jaws asshole. Laughable. It is also known that great white sharks often chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, because they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce (if you don't know, look for it) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca (hey! This is the name of the blatant robbery we're discussing!), How would you weigh more than 6,000 pounds. I could go on, but I don't need it. Jaws is amazing (best acting, best effects, best music, best writing), Orca is a shit (Jaws' BLATANT rip-off, bad writing, abominable effects, more ridiculous plot on this side of an Olson Twins movie). It doesn't take a Columbia University teacher to see it. Watch better movies.
