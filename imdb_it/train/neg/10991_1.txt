My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took a look at the cover (two models on the bathrooms) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed with him looking at what turned out to be probably the most cringeable movie (I use this term freely). I felt obliged to sit down. I didn't dare make eye contact with my brother, sure he must have cursed the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name of the whole film is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears in a scene, that the "director" has decided to show every hold of (about four in total) for the whole film. In fact, the entire film follows this seed practically. The fact that the DVD contained deleted images was a shock. (I went to bed without seeing him, anyway). For no surprise, I found this record without his case behind the TV about a week later.
