This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen at the cinema !! I couldn't wait for it to end. To make matters worse a 12A certificate is given so you don't see anyone shoot, just bodies that fall to the ground, even Babban is killed! Too many scenes were cut to attract younger viewers, because I think the producers knew it would fail disastrously !! Amitabhs 'acting was great, but the aspirant "Basanti" and the other idiot who plays Devgans' partner can't even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I would not look at it for free and I advise all others who read it to do the same. YOU WERE NOTIFIED !!
