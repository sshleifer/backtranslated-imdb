What a pile of garbage ... I can't even begin to describe how awful this movie was. The assessment he has here is really hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Especially if you enjoyed the first ginger shots. The first was well written, well directed, well executed ... a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The second was "alrite" - decent as an independent film, but clearly not up to the first ... The third is an insult to the series, period. I consider the films: 10, 6, 1. It's so ugly. <br /> <br /> Oh, and yes it is really set in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald ... all confused with some native American mythology. The sisters don't have a real story, or a progression, or even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and be "together forever". It's as deep as it becomes. <br /> <br /> Bewildered that the girls agreed to be in this pile of shit, after reading the script. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing, staging The action was terrible: people who appear regularly from nowhere, as if the girls turned around and there was an elaborate candlelight setup with a mystique Native American woman sitting there, about to go on a speech. The sets were terrible, they couldn't get away from the fact that everything was obviously based on a set, which didn't really help. Also, there was constantly snow outside the field, but not a trace inside (... on the set). <br /> <br /> Arrghh ,,, so bad! I really hoped it would be at least as good as the second.
