Demer Daves is a wonderful director when it comes to westerns and the "broken arrow" remains on everyone's mind. As for the melodrama, it should leave him to the acquaintance of people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the fabulous Douglas Sirk. The script is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while watching a warm whine. The character of Natalie Wood was inspired by "imitation of life" by Fannie Hurst (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could believe that she is a black Susan Kohner was more credible in "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis gave so stereotyped parts that they can't do anything with them: the poor officer and the rich and handsome and mean sergeant. of whom does Natalie fall in love with? France shows itself as a land of tolerance, where interracial unions are warmly welcome. At the time (around 1944) it was questionable, it is still for the narrow-minded people that you can find here and everywhere.
