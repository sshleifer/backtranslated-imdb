Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would turn to their graves if they knew that this guess who's coming to dinner Ripoff was in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. This misstep today is a joke. So a white boy from a too stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African-American girlfriend home (Enter GASP here) to his grandfather's funeral. The reactions of his family members were obviously ... predictable. This film was so painfully telegraphed from the beginning to the end my girlfriend actually started pretending to snore to tell me she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Make a pass on Wake.
