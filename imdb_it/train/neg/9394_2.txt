Oh, man, how low the 1952 magazines had fallen! This boring thing is precisely the kind of serial that bothered Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only do the heroes manage to escape from the traps by adding scenes that were not present in the previous chapter (and that CANNOT be there - tell me that when the bad guys explode in the plain in episodes from 7 to 8 they would not see the characters jump), but I think this series has the world record for movies. I mean, most of it is stock footage! And not just from other serials (apparently all flight sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the fantastic "rock fused" scenes of episode 2 or 3 come from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but alone! The entire "Trip to the Moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, lasts 30 seconds and the characters never seem to leave the Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL the scenes of the previous episodes! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9, so they didn't have to do it again!). <br /> <br /> Don't get me started on the scientific factor. Get ready to see the sunniest moon ever! And the men of the Moon who can't breathe in their world? What were they smoking? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, it's too much talked about and the stunts (usually the best thing in a serial) are few and far between. From the visual point of view, am I the only one to think that Commando Cody's (or lemon-shaped) bullet-shaped helmet looks totally ridiculous? The Rocketeer was much nicer, no matter how bad the movie was (and friend, it was terrible). The tank-like vehicle is not much better, it seems that a lot of children did it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is familiar instead of the usual muscular piece (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then it's so unattractive ... < br /> <br /> Nor is it worth looking for nostalgia. See instead Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (By the way, see the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women's Lib pearl).
