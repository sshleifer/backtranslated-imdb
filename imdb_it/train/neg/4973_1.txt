I stopped five minutes after Beowulf was given a double-shot automatic crossbow with viewfinders. Not only the crossbows do not have telescopic sights, but Beowulf beat Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. Even the terrible acting in wood and the eternal darkness that afflicts all the original science fiction films did not help. Having only got a few minutes before I felt my bile grow and decided to watch I Love Lucy, instead, it's really all I have to say. But you might just realize that it's a TV movie and skip it right there. <br /> <br /> A parody.
