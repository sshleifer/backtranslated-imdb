In my opinion, the title of this film should be changed from "Only the Brave" to "All About Lane". I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was rather disappointed with the result. Although, I appreciate that the director made a film about the men of the 442th - a subject that has long deserved in the film industry - the acting in some parts of the film was rather stale. The performances of Marc Dacascos, Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all fantastic. However, the director should NEVER put himself in the shoes of the main character of the film. Sorry Lane, you're not just a movie actor. Keep what you do - theatrical acting. Gina Hiraizumi's performance in this film was also horrible. He should never have had the role of a speaker and his appearance was not suitable for playing the part of a queen Miss Nisei. There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful ... Why weren't they chosen for that role? Another big problem with this film was its action sequences. The Japanese-American soldiers do not seem to be fighting German soldiers ... let alone anyone. Assuming it was a low-budget film, but since it was a war-based film, isn't it important to show some fighting? This film was a worthy attempt, but it certainly doesn't deserve an important distribution.
