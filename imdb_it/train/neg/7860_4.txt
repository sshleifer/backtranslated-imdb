Martin Weisz, who directed the solid "Rohtenburg", will take the heat, with Wes Craven, for another dingy "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original, which boasted an incredible plot and a dog with a flashback, will be erased forever from this technically more refined remake (only in the name). A group of national guards (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills full of mutants. One by one the weekend soldiers are picked up. That's all. There is some violent violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene, but there is little else to be enthusiastic about. The "heroes" of the film are the usual clich√© group and the mutants, very different from Craven's original "family", mostly resemble Brian Thompson of "Cobra" along with some creatures that Stan Winston had left behind for "Wrong Turn ". Much of the action takes place in the caves, "The Descent" wing, and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A laughable aspect is the addition of Wes and Jonathan Craven of a cute mutant who wanders around his cave like Leatherface in Hooper's original "Chainsaw". Weisz will be accused of this boring debacle, but he is not really at fault because he does his best to keep the suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the invented situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
