Once I promised never to go out of any movie (a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different types of dreck, like Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl is almost successful. Hundstage was a truly terrible experience. Anyone who sees this film will think that the Austrians are a group of miserable and pathetic delays. It shows a world in which love and humanity do not exist, a world in which people humble each other for one reason only - to distract themselves from their miserable existence. By choosing a documentary style with non-professional actors (most of them seem directly from the imagination of the silly Austrian filmmaker Deix) the director Seidl wants us to believe that this is real life in the Austrian suburbs (European? Western?). The viewer is confronted with depictions of sexual orgies, violence against women and the handicapped, madness and degradation. But this is not a social criticism. This is pure shock with no aesthetic value. Instead you get a bad acting, a bad cinematography, a bad filmmaking. If someone needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society, then this person must have gone through life with their eyes closed. This is a pseudo-social critique with a mallet. And look at people in a disgustingly condescending way. Show ugly people - that's not why I hate him. But he describes ordinary people in an ugly and misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly despicable.
