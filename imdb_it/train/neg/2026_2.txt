There was such a fuss over a game with Bill Shatner ... and especially in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. So obviously everyone had to tune in to see what it was about the new game show. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says so stoically and nasally, "wow". <br /> <br /> The only nice thing about this show was the fact that you knew it would end. Spending a whole hour was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think are 10 minute intervals, only to find that it's only been a minute (but it seemed like an eternity) since you last you looked at the clock. So why didn't I just change channels? Well, probably for the same reason most other people don't ... out of pure optimism. I mean, nobody wants * really * to think that a show with Bill Shatner can be really so BAD. <br /> <br /> Personally, from the first 15 minutes, I never thought this was the kind of vehicle that would show William Shatner's talents. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching him left me depressed. You still wanted to feel some excitement, but there was nothing to do. There was not even enough light on the set to get a feeling of energy from the audience (which you couldn't even see). Dear Network: People don't watch game programs to cure their insomnia. ... the visualization game shows to be excited and to have fun. Please do us a favor and lose it in the vault.
