The comment of "eliz7212-1" affects the proverbial "nail on the head" for this turkey of a program. But it's a real treat to see William Shatner "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the "" signs on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a great script on SNL or MAD TV - and evaluates some stars for a vision, or so, to see Shatner, who seems to have "encamped" to new levels - whether in a role or as himself. But the boy is fun. <br /> <br /> The girls who are in the cubicle areas with the rolls of game data, will be rather unlucky when this turkey is wiped out - unless there is a revival of the whiskey genre-a- go-go, with a request resurrected to curvy women still dancing in high cages. <br /> <br /> I saw the first competitor, who was annoying, and literally "more stupid than a: post," still through pure luck, left with a quarter of a mil. The second competitor, a little smarter, but who would be lucky to earn $ 1,000 for Jeopardy!, Was zoned with the card that asks him to answer a special question - he didn't know, and then left with the zilch. <br /> <br /> This plethora of play shows, which dangle, and sometimes reward, large sums for everyday individuals, are certainly an economic effort, on the whole, to try to win over the spectators. Even if the host is well rewarded, and give away six figures in an average episode, I suppose the revenue over costs can be favorable - since you don't have a sitcom cast where several stars get six or seven digits , by episode, with some big business remaining. <br /> <br /> But I suspect that even the best will run out soon. This has already practically reached this point. I think his offers, especially with James Spader, and others on "Boston Legal" should give us a satisfying amount of offers from Bill Shatner. <br /> <br /> Once again, the above assessment is simply appropriate to view Bill hoot and prance, perhaps once; should be enough
