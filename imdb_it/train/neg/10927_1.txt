The reviews of this film have been tepid at best, while the expectations were high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a pretty funny idea and a main actress that everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's seemingly humorous journey into the fantasy world in no way manages to entertain her audience (I didn't hear a single laugh during the entire presentation), going through the subtle plot of the page and the one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic he wanted to have. The 90-minute movie here is sterile with a clumsy direction and some good actors do their best to become professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem like a great idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches, connected with a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or bore you haunted.
