Useless film boring with charismatic Mercury completely wasted. Released for a minute on Thursday in a local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney, except me and four others, BACK OF BEYOND is a project apparently created by a producer in search of compensation. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (as Polson has turned into a director of limping thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems to never have a guernsey apart from criminal roles. But Paul Mercury should have become one of Australia's biggest screen exports. Roles like this are big disappointments and movies like this are just a waste of talent and time.
