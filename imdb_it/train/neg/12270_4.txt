This ghost movie by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is pretty wild and has at least a jump fright that caught me off guard. But all in all, the film is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out that he could have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a beautiful Asian ghost lady, and has no idea why (or even the viewer). While other murders are committed, it becomes even more confusing as the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the ghost lady is more fun than anything else, especially when she suddenly flies into the city, like Wonder Woman. And the ending has little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can't recommend it at all. If he hadn't taken this seriously, I'd think it should be a black comedy. Outside "Bright Future" this is the worst film directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I've ever seen.
