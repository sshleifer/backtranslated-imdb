This is a review of "Freddy Mercury The Untold Story", released for the cinema, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most fake, uninspired and boring biographical documentaries I've ever seen. If the film I saw in a cinema was originally published on TV, I would ask its producers and distributors not to deceive a paying audience with the false promise of a noteworthy feature film. Even as a TV-tailored documentary, the sentimental piano solos that accompanied the interviewees seated in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo-literary narration sounded truer than a bed by Sleepapedic Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of "The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury" - or, um, it was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" are the original concert, videos and television footage - full Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonials interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses with insights, such as: "He was a free spirit" (actually .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) belittling those testimonies of Freddy, Brian May or Montserrat Caballe who has poured new and affectionate light into the complex life and character of Mercury. And ... What's up with the Harry Potter college segments? How does the interview with the first girl-crush ("... who now works in a travel agency") and the members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? The milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and his growth, the Queen, the band remain unexplored. These filmmakers do not pose a single provocative question, nor do they engage in an independent or visionary search for their subject, creating instead a tedious montage of clean and widely empty comments on an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, which he does not deserve to be remembered by this biography of the History Channel that your grandparents can fall asleep on Sunday nights.
