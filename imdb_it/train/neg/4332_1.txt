This film is a bad attempt to make the original fans feel complete. The only thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original was so successful was closely related to the fact that it should have made you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This film makes me want to go to the bathroom. I'm not a bad guy, but the man who plays in this movie is ... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of Carlito Brigante's life and I'm sorry for having had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this movie. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it.
