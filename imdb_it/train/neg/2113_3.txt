The brides die on the altar and their corpses vanish. No one knows why or who, but an investigative journalist (Luana Walters) notes that every bride wears a strange orchid and goes to interview her creator, Dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi). Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a fairly short execution time that should not be boring. Unfortunately, as he starts quite well, he begins to drag himself before the halfway point and becomes rather boring with his clich√©s and predictable plot. <br /> <br /> There are some positive things about it - Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and behaves brilliantly; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful, gentle, twisted and disquieting countess; and I'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto. Luana Walters is also convincing as a reporter here. <br /> <br /> Keeps some gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent. <br /> <br /> But overall, he failed to keep my interest through the whole image, and for that, I have to misjudge.
