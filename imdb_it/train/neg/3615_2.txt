Why have I never seen or heard of this junk movie before? It is my own alley with a bloody teenage plot, a ridiculous plot and an irresistible 80s cheese atmosphere around. For some reason that nobody is really interested, the staff and students of an elite Catholic university are massacred by an unknown psychopath. The newly recruited teacher, Julie Parker, gets involved when all the people she is in contact with show up dead or behave strangely. This movie is hilariously bad! There is absolutely no logic or consistency and each character is equally meaningless to others. For example, there is a girl killed and her body dumped in a container. Then, for no reason, the story suddenly advances three weeks, but the murdered girl is never named or lost. Not even from her boyfriend! The acting is pitiful and there is not even a little nudity to be enjoyed. The revelation of the killer is rather funny because the producers seemed really convinced that it was an original touch ... Not so, guys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror-turkey ever.
