I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before going to this movie the day after it came out, I came to IMDb to take a look at the comments. A comment called the film predictable and poor with a terrible dialogue. I've never seen other people's opinions, so I wasted seven dollars on this shit movie. It had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be pushed by a cliff. Since when do horror movies have sloppy scenes? I swear, I'm amazed that there was no HUG GROUP ^ - ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. One time. And that's because I moved away, thinking of my research paper for English. The clich√©, birds / cats popping out of nowhere when you thought something would happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost laughed when the alarm went off and the protagonist said: "I have to get my mother's shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Security is only a few steps away, but NO, my mother's shawl (which didn't match the dress) is WAYYYY more important than my health and safety. And to top it all off, they take her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> Even my friend and I had foreseen the film WHOLE. And not only that, I bet you hide under the bed, moments. It was the "stole the bellboy's clothes and sneaked out of the hotel" and "He's the detective who goes down the hallway, not the killer!" moments. The films should NEVER BE THIS predictable. Disney movies are not even predictable. <br /> <br /> I will now complete my rant by saying that this was a terrible film. I'm glad I went to see him at the cinema, so I wouldn't buy it for $ 15.00 and then I hate it. It was just ugly. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after being hit by the detective, the killer would have fallen into the same position in which he was shot. Knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl as she came down. Oh, how nice it would have been. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time and money. Go see a good movie.
