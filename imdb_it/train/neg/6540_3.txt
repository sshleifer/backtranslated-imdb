I can't believe that so many are comparing this film with Argento's. His work is much more imaginative and vicious - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director simply does not have the ability to create real tension. The murder scenes - and let's face it, this is the genre of this genre - are not interesting. It wasn't hard to guess who the killer was, and I really didn't care when it was revealed. Cinematography is not memorable, and the much praised 19th century Gothic atmosphere did not attract me. Many actors are pretty good (especially the principal and the sadistic girl who opposes younger students), but there are few things to do. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are undertones of incest, sadomasochism and lesbianism, but incredibly, they add very few spices or suspense. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good horror movie, look elsewhere.
