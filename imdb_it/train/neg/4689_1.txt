A really terrible film made by the director of photography, Ted Tetzlaff. Pretty good movie, but for a time bomb movie totally devoid of any tension. Ford, as some have put it here, sleepwalkers though this with its characteristic grin. There are some details thrown around - ex-Canadian army or RAF, bombs defused in the war, his wife is leaving him - but none of these backward stories adds to much. The same bomber is a complete mystery. Why are you trying to blow up this shipment of mines? Besides, what period are we talking about here? World War II or post-war ?? I hired the latter which makes the reason for the bomber even more salient. In general, however, only a horrible film. There are many good time bomb shots to skip this. Watch any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time, at about the same runtime.
