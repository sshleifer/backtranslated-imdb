I grew up pouring Wrinkle's intertwined stories into Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a writer would come across their child sitting on a big sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and he would think, what would have been a fantastic film. Sadly enough that the writer has failed, changing characters, throwing lame humor and destroying the plot. I know it's hard to turn a well-loved novel into a movie. But why can't you stay true to the book? Why do you have to change the way characters think and act? For those of you who haven't read the book, take it, find a soft sofa and let your imagination run wild.
