I watched the first 15 minutes, thinking it was a real documentary (with an excessively dramatic "on camera" producer). <br /> <br /> When I realized it was all staged, I thought "why should I waste my time looking at this garbage?" So I turned it off and got online to warn other people. The characters do not act credibly. too much immature emotion. because a boy traveled from half the world to a country devastated by war, he behaved as a child. and I don't think it was because "his character was so upset about the attacks on the mall". <br /> <br /> very trivial and stupid. <br /> <br /> have you seen "city of loss" children "? French dark fantasy film about a boy who kidnaps children and steals their dreams ... I liked it!
