I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I've ever finished it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember they flashed something back in 1970 and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have said it in the 1970s. He could also have a cell phone, I don't remember, it was just awful. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they were bringing the movie and if I could catch up the time of my life. Today is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some very bad ones.
