Kojak meets the Mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past who seems rather forgettable. I never thought his show was so great. This is his one-dimensional characterization of a criminal boss, with very predictable results. If you take car chases and the general runs away, there's not much development or action in the plot. I find that mafia films are boring because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, Italian cinema, treats these kids as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I won't remember much. A lot of shootings, innocent passers-by who die, betrayals and that sick loyalty. The film is photographed quite well and the acting is decent. But dubbing is so ugly (due to rumors that they couldn't get out of those bodies), that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
