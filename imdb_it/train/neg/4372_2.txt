I LOVE Don Knotts, let me tell you this in advance! He is a huge talent and the best at what he does, representing a nervous, amiably confused loser, thrown into a position of authority. It's fabulous in this role as Roy Fleming, the reluctant astronaut, but the film is pretty boring, really, although as a child my brother and I are happy to see this and his other films. It is still worth looking at, but in reality it is a film that children like best. I would rate it 100% for the whole family and something you could sit and watch with your children on a family evening. <br /> <br /> Like all Knotts movies, there is a great cast of beloved actors and you can't help but smile when Knotts gives one of his trembling, open-mouthed looks, no matter how much you are old and tired. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, one thing I think is This film is exceptional for capturing NASA in the 1960s: all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, the future! And I was surprised at how cute she was and she studied Leslie Neilsen at the time. The only complaint about the story is Roy's love interest, a rather frayed and unpredictable woman who can't give him the time of day until it becomes a big blow - if you're like me, you'll hope he gives her pushed to the end. Attention: you will whistle the melody of the theme for days after watching, it is so captivating.
