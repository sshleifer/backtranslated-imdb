This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. I can't express how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself several times through this atrocious experience just to end the pain. Instead I recommend seeing this movie, taking a bath with acid, then at least you'll know a fraction of the pain without all the scars. <br /> <br /> I had great expectations when I read the back of the DVD case, and when he initially added that Jesus was following them I was so excited ... then in the end I wanted to kill myself. I mean a 23-minute introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of cinema ... JUST PAIN! The monkeys could have done a better job by modifying this garbage. At least they would have thrown the feces and blurred part of the garbage. It would have been better not to have seen any of the horror films. <br /> <br /> It's not that I didn't take the jokes, it's that they weren't just amusing, they repeated themselves like twenty times. Apparently, something isn't funny if you don't see it millions of times. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances see this. People rated "Manos the Hands of Fate" as the worst movie in the world. I also saw this and I agree that it is bad ... but ALAS is only the second worst. 'Fatty Drives the Bus' is far worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves all kinds of hard language, but I can't write it here, so I guess I swore a lot of people.
