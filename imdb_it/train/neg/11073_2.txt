This is incredibly bad and incredibly embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow a good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world. BUT WE MAKE BLOOD FILMS! This is not particularly bad. It is particularly typical and typically ugly, filmed in double-headed hotels and public parks with subtle direction, school-level acting and "golden wizard ... let's see what this button does on the camera ??" photography. If Michael Moriarity was so intent on playing Jack Nicholson, couldn't he at least have done a GOOD imitation of Jack Nicholson? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most enchanting cities in the world and also a yacht building center (part of the "plot") because in the name of God we let this endemic Canadian inferiority complex say it disguises itself like Seattle ??? Not only am I crazy about this movie, I'm embarrassed and a little embarrassed. Australians have wonderful things. We produce pretentious piffle of second choice. Gawd !!!!!
