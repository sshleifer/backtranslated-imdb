Corridors of time. The movie you can watch if you're looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use guns, ropes or gas, but do you want to ruin your brain? Don't wait any longer! Corridors of time is probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: to think that Christian Clavier is able to act and have fun. I don't miss the 45 francs that this poor thing cost me: sometimes, you have to reset your evaluation system by looking at absolute zero. This film deserves a 2/10, but it's only because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also starred in Ronin. I think I won't like it ...
