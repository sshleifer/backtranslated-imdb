This English boiler boiler has one thing: young people are uniformly beautiful. The older men are ostentatious, the right-wing Thatcherites whose behavior reports all the acrimony of the Reagan / Thatcher years. Young or old, however, the moral in this three-part miniseries is universally suspect and nobody comes particularly well. <br /> <br /> Nick is a handsome young gay just out of Oxford. It's not fundamental to the story, but it has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair that makes it much easier to watch this game. Nick comes to London with a friend, whose father Gerald is a wealthy conservative politician, and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France. They fail to inform him that, upset, Cat cuts himself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen tools. Nick errs in his own selfish "gratitude" for affection and moves in, discovering too late how much they despise and protect him. Nick, inexplicably, has lived in this house for four years but, since the plot depends on this point, it is better not to question it. <br /> <br /> While Nick is more pleasant to watch, he is unbearably obsequious. His disdainful subjection to the wealthy bigots soon made me climb the walls. Deeply closed except for Cat (she guesses his big secret on sight), he likes a little anonymous sex just so we know he's actually gay. Although it doesn't seem possible, Nick takes a lover who is even more closed than he is. <br /> <br /> Supercilious Tories disdain and insult the two blacks in the film, so imagine the poison that spits when Nick's sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid. Gerald, in true Tory style, has been involved in several personal and financial scandals, so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment. This gives Gerald one last chance to chastise the unfortunate boy warily. <br /> <br /> Except for a brief moment of indignation, Nick takes the abuse on him in silence and tacit agreement. Denial, self-loathing, naivety or ignorance? You decide if you can get this thing through without throwing something on the set.
