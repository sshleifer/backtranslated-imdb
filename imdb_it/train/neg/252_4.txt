The uninspired direction leaves a decent cast, stranded in a beautiful but insignificant adaptation, in which the dialogue seems to be played rather than sorrowful, and the ghostly cash-strapped apparitions fail to contain any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, like the ghost of the Christmas present, staggers on stilts and seems to make an impression of Bernard Cribbins. Like Scrooge, George C. Scott is too ironic, and never seems to really believe it, which takes away his performance from its effect. The scenes in which he showed his past have the same impact as if he were flipping through his family album lightly. No one else seems to commit, except for Frank Finlay, who collapses chronically.
