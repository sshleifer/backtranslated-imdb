I was crazy that anyone made this movie. I was even more angry for having lost precious minutes of my life by sitting and watching this. I could have done a waxing job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. At first I was a little confused, but then I understood and understood what was happening. At this point the film was half-finished and Yes, I'm a procrastinator but I always want to see things until the end. So I put it out I looked at everything. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, but they are not convincing. I saw my grandson shout for attention more convincingly than the alleged lust portrayed on the screen in this film. If you like bad movies with bad acting, look at this.
