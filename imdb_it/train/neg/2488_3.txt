What an incomprehensible confusion of a film. Something about a policeman pulling bullets out of himself after they shot him and holding them in a glass jar in his bathroom (and the size of the jar he fired fifty times now) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason lead them to Mexico. It was never clear if they were sent there intentionally or if they really were really lost. And you'll never hear another script with the word "butthorn" again. Gary Busey rehearses the role of Mel Gibson from "Lethal Weapon" and while Busey is a useful actor the script damages the whole film to mediocrity. William Smith makes another round as a Russian soldier, the same character played in "Red Dawn" some years before. After playing with cyclists for most of the 1970s, it was a pleasure to see him expand his range by playing heavy communists. Sadly he will probably always be remembered as the boy that Clint Eastwood performs in "Every Which Way You Can".
