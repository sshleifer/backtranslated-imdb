Left Behind is the kind of movie "We know what we know because we know it" that Christians (and most any other naive person) need to help them feel what "THINK" and "BELIEVE" (not "KNOW") is right. But at the same time, I feel bad for kids, because this is not a well made film. It doesn't help any message. I work in a video store, and I KNOW the ONLY reason why people went to see this movie because they were religious and thought it was. SOMEONE on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know they don't know. I've had enough (but only after having had too much) of these people who turn their noses up in the air thinking that a movie played by a semi-talented TV actor means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself you will stay away. I refuse to go into the details of this movie (not because AI didn't see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking for my atheist to handle (because it wasn't), or IC really I have nothing to say about it (because I do it.) Reason, (which is a word that no one has helped to make this film understood) is that I want this movie out of my mind, I want it to be made of my head, I want me to look at EVERYTHING WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the film from my head, I just want all the things that were in my head BEFORE seeing these movies there, Anything directly related to this movie in my head GET OUT! My peaceful anger is ending, I am sorry that someone in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but they won't) when they could have given that Seven Dollars Plus to which any other charity of Human, Animal or Rainforest. that therefore they would not be able to "BELIEVE" in the fact that it is real, they may have to do what it is. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (out of ****)
