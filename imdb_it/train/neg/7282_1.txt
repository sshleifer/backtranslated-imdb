National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. Whether you liked the hippie stoner days of the late sixties or the smug and cheeky period of the seventies (when the play was fortified with a lot of naked girls) depends very much on your date of birth, but everyone agrees on fact that in the early eighties, middle age had eliminated all the remaining anarchist sparks that drugs did not have, and offers like this film and the increasingly terrible spin-off records fired more holes in the hull. Outside of a well illustrated sequence of titles, there is absolutely nothing to recommend to this singularly depressing stinkbug. If you can overcome the disconcerting opening segment, 'Growing Myself', hoping that things will improve, bad luck ... no. Anyone who thought that the idea of ​​a woman brutally raped with a piece of butter was the gold of the comedy deserved to have her head returned to a tray of messy dogs. If there is always a global shortage of picks, the negatives of this tramp, incoherent junk of shoddy ideas and terrible exhibits could well do something.
