After reading the comments on the site I feel compelled to write for the first time. It seems that this film is like Marmite and has divided the audience. I must say that, while I agree, the films must not make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), but they must still involve you with the characters. Now, while I was completely absorbed in the murderous lesbian relationship in Lynch's work, I must say that I couldn't make a shit about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters who lived in this world of dayglo. <br /> <br /> Also, while many people seem to be trying to say that you don't like them because you didn't understand it, I wouldn't agree - I didn't like it because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and the constant listening of those quotes repeatedly didn't help me. Call it intelligently if you want - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> However, the main reason I write is to ask all other reviewers a question - there were no credits on the print of the movie I saw. Only music on black. Have I seen a dud print or is it proof of GR's pretentiousness? Or, all those involved in the film look at the rough cut and have removed their name ???
