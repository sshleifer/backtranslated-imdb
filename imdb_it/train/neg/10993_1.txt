Of course, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we actually enjoy them, but this wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. Some guy, wins offer, who is conceited enough to be the main character while he probably got drunk / high - probably both - and thought it was a good idea to make a movie. Then he continued to show his script to equally tall / drunk individuals. Overall, this film was so ugly, predictable and not original that I couldn't get it through 20 minutes before turning it off. Makes you look like Citizen Kane. Batman? WTF ... Someone who goes around with a bat, real original. Almost like calling it Fat Man, and having a fat guy around with a superhero outfit.
