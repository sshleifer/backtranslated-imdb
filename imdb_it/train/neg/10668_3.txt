This film had some great actors! Unfortunately they had forgotten how to behave. I was hoping the film would improve as it went on, but the acting was so robotic that it was doomed from the start. It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script all the time. Maybe it was the musical score or the director himself, but one thing is certain that the makeup artist has to get another job! The face powder was so thick you could see it caked on the faces of the actors! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, no wonder he never hit the theaters. Cuba Gooding Jr. / James Woods shame on you guys for not giving up. The Plot was great, he just needed a lot more.
