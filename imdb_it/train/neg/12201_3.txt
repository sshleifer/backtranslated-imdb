The summary summarizes all in all. This is not at all as good as the original. With a script written both by Stallone and by James Cameron (at the same time he also wrote Aliens). Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was in the best physical condition while he was doing this and Rocky 4 and he looks in good shape or armed with steroid eyes, depending on his point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to carry out a special mission that can give him a presidential pardon. In the end he accepts and goes to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier who plays a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as ex-forces to appease Rambo. <br /> <br /> The mission is to find out if there are missing the prisoners of war still alive in the camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen because the camp he was controlling was somewhere where he had previously been a prisoner. He is told that it is not a rescue mission and that he is there to take only reconnaissance photos. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to parachute from a plane he loses most of his equipment, meets his contact (which turns out to be a pretty woman) and travels along the river with the pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> Find that there are still prisoners and save one. While the 3 flee from the middle of the Vietnamese army on their river boat are betrayed by pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to continue to the collection point on foot after their boat has been rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is again betrayed and abandoned while Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. It is clear that Trautman returns to the base to reproach him for not having survived. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff introduces himself as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually manages to escape only to be chased by more Vietnamese Troops and Spetznatz. Killing many of them, Rambo finally steals a helicopter and saves most of the prisoners to return to his base. <br /> <br /> Resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning it, but destroys the Operations Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and a very weak ending while Rambo moves away towards sunset like a free man.
