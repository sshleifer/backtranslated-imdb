I can't understand why all these relics of the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. It is clear how frustrated they were during the Communist censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their films, and now they imagine that I don't know what a great deal of artistic freedom and full of life fill the screen with people who defecate, urinate, vomit , swearing and every other kind of imaginable horror. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget Bunuels Chien Andalou, on David Lynch, on Forman and neorealism and other filmmakers who were able to work with an aesthetic of ugliness. Those people were mastering their jobs - well, you don't! Do us all a favor, all of you Daneliuc and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other obsolete old people, and leave us alone! It's some time to watch some Romanian movies on the screen, enough with your terrible immature! You are not a director, you are ILLITERATED !!!
