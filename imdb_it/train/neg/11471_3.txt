Is it a coincidence that Orca was created two years after Jaws? Orca is not exactly a "Jaws rip off" but it is obvious that he tried to take advantage of Jaws' success. First of all I think the Orca was a bad movie, not terrible but definitely not good, at best in the media. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male orca (orca) after seeing his companion and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge. I couldn't bear to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is scarce and compared to Jaws it seems that the director, the producers and the writers were almost devoid of talent. <br /> <br /> As for acting, he was very average and believable, but the real characters are not the least sympathetic. The effects were fine for his time and the killer whale movie looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> Violence is confused, bloody and not recommended for the most sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very noisy, smothering the sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (the killer whales don't unite with a single companion as depicted in Orca). <br /> <br /> Overall this film was bad / poor in my opinion due to the reasons listed above. Some people might like this movie more because of the concept of revenge between animals and humans, so I don't have I'm going to break this film and I can understand why some people might like it. <br /> <br /> My vote: 3.5 / 10 (but for his concept maybe a 5/10)
