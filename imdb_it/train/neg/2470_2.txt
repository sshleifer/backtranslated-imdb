I have seen many horror shows over the years, such as Nightstalker, which dealt with the legend of Wendigo, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit that caused chaos to add flavor to the Halloween season. The man was wrong. The whole film creates this sense of events that are about to happen that will be scary and gruesome, but then provides a very simplistic story of revenge and murder on the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - no! This film has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser. <br /> <br /> It is increasingly difficult to believe in anything Hollywood proposes scary movies, as they rarely find anything original and ghostly. Which idiots pay for such a fake movie? Go back to the design forums and do something useful with those millions of green tickets you have to throw.
