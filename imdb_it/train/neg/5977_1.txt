Wow. I don't even remember much about this movie, except it's smelly. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically; a girl's parents neglect her, so this sick PokeMon pretends to be his father. Am I the only one disturbed by that? Then, this wacky PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mother to pretend to be the girl's. I don't care if he's trying to make the girl happy, that's just lousy. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. The girl was just a whining marmot that wanted things her way. He played with Unowns, was the "daughter" of Entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age for a whim with the help of his "dad". <br /> <br /> This is pretty much all I can remember, but I think I can take it as a suggestion and not see it. (Or if you see it, don't expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, rent "PokeMon; the first movie".
