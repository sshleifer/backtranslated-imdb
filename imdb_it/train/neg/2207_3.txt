Hammerhead is a combination of the mad scientist and the film genres of the killer sharks. In a bit of casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the aforementioned mad scientist who develops a human / hammerhead shark creature. Strangely, this being is actually his son, who turned into this monster to keep him from dying of cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of members is invited to the scientist's private island. They end up being used as a shark bait or a shark nut. For some unknown reason the head of IT was carried out as part of this team. I wonder why? Fortunately, he turns out to be a resourceful, Ramboesco hero, albeit a little overweight. I'm working on the assumption that he learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of his day job working in front-line support. A normal day for this IT man presumably involves fixing the network connection of someone followed by a call to the gun for the wicked gunmen. Or maybe a call should be scheduled to repair someone's PC in physical confrontations with human-land shark hybrids? However, it is incredible and saves the day. He's the girl too. <br /> <br /> The man-shark is a lame creation but OK, I guess, judging by the effects in general in this film. And the film goes on at a decent pace. Obviously it's a real surprise, but if you buy a movie called Hammerhead and you expect it to be a complex drama about the emotional conflicts experienced by a man turned into a killer of land, then you have no one to blame but yourself. As it is, there are weapons, blood, girls and maybe even an exploding helicopter. It's rubbish but not as bad as some might say.
