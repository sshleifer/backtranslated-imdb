Well, I can and will be very brief. This is a wrong film, not convincing, which could have been a little better. The script does not seem to know which way to go ... from funny to clich√©-wise ... it's a bit silly. More than too many phrases we've heard before "the hacker is in florida, or not, he's in Madrid, no he's in ..., he's fucking the signal". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
