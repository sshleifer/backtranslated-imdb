"A young woman suffers from the delirium of being a werewolf, based on a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one. Because of his past treatment by men, he travels to the country seducing and killing men who meets Falling in love with a kind man, her life seems to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a gang of thugs.P traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the hooligans ", according to the synopsis of the cover of the DVD. <br /> <br /> "The Lupa Mannara" by Rino Di Silvestro begins with the frontal, twisted, plaintive dance of the blonde and shapely Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches the background fire between its legs. The "flashback" opening reveals that his hairy ancestor was (probably) a werewolf creature. Mrs. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she is simply a very strong madwoman. <br /> <br /> As a film, "Werewolf Woman" (in English) would have been better if the character of Borel was indeed a female werewolf; with his sexual victimization a lot of characterization. But as for the 1970's skin and blood gestures, this is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is naked or dressed in a sexy way throughout the film, which presents a good dose of cold blood. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (like Luca) are good support players.
