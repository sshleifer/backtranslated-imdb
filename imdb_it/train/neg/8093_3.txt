Based on the satirical novel by Tom Wolfe that everyone praised (I haven't read it yet) Tom Hanks plays a wall streeter who accidentally kills a black guy while he gets lost in a bad part of Willis, in New York, as the reporter that starts Hanks on his The downward spiral ... The characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this film and for a comedy or a satire there are not even a lot of laughs ... Melanie Griffith made them doing breasts during filming so it was a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during the different parts of the movie ... This will keep your mind away from other things like a lack of script or humor .. On a scale from one to ten.3
