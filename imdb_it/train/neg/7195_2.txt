Disney did it again. The company that created "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" has made another film that barely resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and retains all the spirit of the original. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young, and a dream come true for one of his films. Now that that film exists, I was deeply disappointed, even indignant. <br /> <br /> First we have the characters. <br /> <br /> Gadget itself has the gadgets that made him such a funny character in the original cartoon (with well-executed special effects that accompany them), and even has a bit of the ingenuity of the original gadget, but he is now more competent and is expected to solve the crime alone while Penny and Brain watch. <br /> <br /> Penny has little to do; while playing an important role in the cartoon, discovering crime and stopping it, and occasionally being captured by MAD agents, it is now simply presented and then forgotten, even if it at least sneaks onto the Claw base. <br /> Claw is the film version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister man, with a hoarse voice, who wore metal gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and supervised to various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand, with no mystery behind the character. <br /> <br /> In the film there is Brain and Mad Cat, but they are rather insignificant. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the cartoon are not spared in this mess. The famous expression "Wowsers!" has been mysteriously changed to "Wowser" and Gadgetmobile of Gadget now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There are even product reviews everywhere. Why "Yahoo!" advertised on a cartel? Why does the Gadgetmobile have buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Cardboard fans will hate it, others may find the film below par, and when all is said and done, this film is another attempt to earn some money from another old show .
