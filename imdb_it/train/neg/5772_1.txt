I just have to add, in case someone actually reads this and has not yet completely reached the point. These other reviewers are not joking, this is really the worst color film you'll probably see. When the film started, I couldn't believe that such a thing had really been shown by the world. <br /> <br /> They don't say it only when they say it looks like a movie of origin. He really does. As the "director" took the family's hi8 camcorder (first of DV cameras and non-linear computer editing), no other equipment (lights, audio equipment, etc.) grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. No screenplay, simply inventing it as it went on. <br /> <br /> When I looked at it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one audio channel (left-right speaker). At first I thought I had it badly connected. The film remained silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes. I got up and went to the other channel and suddenly I heard music and sound effects, but then I couldn't hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound on several bloody channels! I mean, there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad are good, kind of things. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit I'm a little budding director. And seeing bad movies makes you want to go out and TRY you can do it better, you know. But watching him made me feel sorry for whoever did it. <br /> <br /> Though bad, actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the girl was hot and was disappointed by the brevity of her bathroom scene. A little of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie but you find crap, throw in some free nudity. He worked for Roger Corman.
