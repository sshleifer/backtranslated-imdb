The writer had a pretty decent idea for a story, but many flaws in the execution of the plot took away so much from the film as to make it unwatchable. Basic elements like character development have been ignored, at best. Inconsistencies have also raised their ugly heads. A large villa in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? The characters "show up" in the gardens during a stormy night (at very convenient times, I might add)? All in all it was not "bad". I rated it a 4, based mainly on the history and talent of Alison Elliott.
