This film has such inexorable cheapness in all its scenes, effects, etc. To make you think they spent 80% of their budget on Connery. It's like watching a few things about Wing Commander after Star Wars (other than the content). <br /> <br /> The story can be described in one word: FLAT. And, my God, I can't remember a villain so uninteresting for a long time. We are not given any reason why he is so evil (an innate defect, we are led to think :) nor any real belief or talent for his wickedness. <br /> <br /> If you're out for Connery, rather go renting `Hunting Forrester '.
