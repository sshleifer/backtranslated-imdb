I came across this film on a rainy Sunday, intending to tune in to something else. Out of curiosity, I read the comments here and found myself looking at it until the end. I didn't really do it with intent - this was one of those movies where you're "fascinated" and watch it for "another couple of minutes", until you only look at the end. And the accusation contained in most of these comments has made the vision more fascinating. The only comment in which the person really liked seems to be exclusively the result of the acceptance of Ladd and Spano and their previous roles. But there is nothing exceptional to find anywhere here - history, performances, and in particular the absurd child's play. We all know that Perry Mason (before Raymond Burr exceeds the score of 300 pounds) and Ben Matlock, enjoyed some leeway in the courtroom, instead of being tediously confined to a lectern. And in Matlock it is granted in particular the privilege of often entering shows simply by going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and the prosecutor have been informed or shown. No real life judge or attorney would stand for it. <br /> <br /> Both Perry and Ben have almost always closed the proceedings tormenting a confession of the real murderer. In reality Perry almost always did it, but often Matlock simply presented overwhelming evidence of the real culprit, pronounced it "reasonable doubt" and then left the police and prosecutors to proceed against the culprit - sometimes on the camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show. <br /> <br /> But having said that, Holland Taylor's histrionics and the amount of freedom he offered them, in the classroom part of this story, made the actions of Matlock / Mason more similar to slow and thick details boring as those seen on Court TV and in real life classrooms. <br /> <br /> Each character in this presentation was bland, unpleasant, unpleasant, boring, unlikely - or a combination of two or more of them. <br /> <br /> The ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but, again, fascinating for this. Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. the films would appear to be their best strength - probably the best in the 2nd role (probably better if in "3rd") roles, even here. Taylor could be chosen as an aunt or mother of one of them. Give this 1 star for the story / shows and 3 additional for the charm factor.
