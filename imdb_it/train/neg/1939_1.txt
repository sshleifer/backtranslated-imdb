Come on! Go with the guys who beat Pakistan. Bollywood can not only make brilliant films, but it can seriously interest a generation of spectators. <br /> <br /> I am a HUGE Bollywood fan, but the anti-Pakistani films make me too screwed to enjoy the script, the cinematography, the action sequences - everything. <br /> <br /> I am really happy to see that viewers on both sides of the border are rejecting propaganda, and there are films like Main Hoon Na that have done brilliantly not only because they deserved because of the quality of its masala of Bollywood - but also because it tries to say: give peace a chance and shows that there are fools out there on both sides who do not represent the masses.
