Justifications for what happened to his film in terms of distributors and secondary directors, drunkards and receptionists who do rewrite scripts aside, let's just take this movie as it is offered, without extraneous explanations. <br /> <br /> This movie is God awful. Straight on craptastic. Rather than repeating what can serve as a plot, I will make a highlight reel of some curious points that made me scratch my head. <br /> <br /> A class (of 5) take a field trip for a history lesson in the middle of friggin 'nowhere Ireland. These students can be Canadian or American, it's hard to say. That it was shot in a Canadian forest rather than in Ireland is pretty obvious. A student seems to know nothing about the story and is basically the "stupid jock" character of a certain number of kicks in 80 films, except when he channels Randy from Scream. A character can be the stand-in for Chris Klein. She has a girl who is probably killed, but she is never really established if it is true. A character is grumpy and removed from his peers ... just ... because ... and then there's a blonde girl. Yay blonde girl. <br /> <br /> Ireland has a population of 2. They are cousins. Gary, who is clearly the same age or younger than the rest of the cast, is called "sir" more than once. It is very disturbing and wears a knitted cap. His cousin is an abused porn star with the worst Irish accent for befoul movies in my life and most likely beyond. <br /> <br /> Picturesque Ireland has many Canadian forests and wetlands and 2 ducks that appear more than once in cut scenes. <br /> <br /> The producers have a discount on the bowels of the volume. Good for them. <br /> <br /> Without my knowledge, horrible freaks have access to brand new hunting knives. Perhaps there is a kind of outdoorsman outlet nearby with a blind and deaf employee working on the register. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, unbeknownst to you, if you got used to it for about 600 years, as history leads us to believe that it happened, ended up being a bit lumpy, but surprisingly spied on and strong enough. Genetics is a wonderful game of craps. <br /> <br /> There may or may not be more than a strange one in this film. We refer to "them" and we see the shadows, but we only see a strange looking guy. And when a strange-looking guy is finally killed, it seems that all the danger has passed. I'm running with my initial hypothesis that no one thought of dressing a second man in complete makeup, so they just used that. Here's how it looks on the screen, anyway. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco should be ashamed. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, apart from these splendid new knives, freak inbred have access to some elegant leather gears, as once Richard Grieco cuts his bonds, there are fresh ones ready for the next sucker that is tied up ... which then escapes, because the chains give you enough nonsense to be able to just cancel them, making them wonder why they even bother to bind anyone. <br /> <br /> A corpse in a shack will be full of larvae after what I imagine has been about 2 hours. Said dead body will also have glasses, when no character has worn them. Curious. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson appears without reason from the left stage, chatting for 2 minutes, vanishes on the left stage. In the middle of a giant forest. It's not unusual, since Gary can also come out of nowhere, which is also known as anything that exists on TV off the screen. <br /> <br /> Ms. Jameson dies sadly and somehow her clothes vanish like my hopes that this movie won't suck the wind. I offer a special nod to the "Breeder" character, the poor girl who has been used by monsters for months (or maybe years) for breeding purposes. The poor girl who still has eyeshadow and who emulates on the camera with all the passion and conviction of a stuffed chihuahua. <br /> <br /> The finale of this film has clearly been turned by a drunk or someone with a fierce mental disability that has been cultivated and encouraged with excessive gasoline consumption over the years. <br /> <br /> Apparently it wasn't just random shit that I found in the late night movie network, apparently people heard about it and even followed it through film production. How sad for all of you. I have nothing else to say. May God have mercy on us all.
