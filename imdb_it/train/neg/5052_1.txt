Platoon is the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is boxing heavyweight championship. The story of Oliver Stone on the experience of a platoon of the American army in Vietnam in 1968 is so exaggerated that it is ridiculous. While most or all occurrences of the Platoon have occurred over more than 10 years of US military involvement in Vietnam, portraying these things happening to a small group of men in such a short time (weeks) gives a horribly distorted image of war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see the whole following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers killing civilians, US soldiers raping civilians, a US sergeant killing another US sergeant, an American soldier killing a sergeant US, US soldiers killed / injured by friendly fire, 90% + killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone, trying to make this film pass like the typical experience of an American soldier in Vietnam is a disgrace. Two films about the Vietnam war that I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the true story of probably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
