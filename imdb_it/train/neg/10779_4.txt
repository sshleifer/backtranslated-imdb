I found this film as a total disappointment. The talent available to the director - in particular Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main protagonists) - have been completely wasted in a story that is not formal and mediocre, of which one could not really worry a conclusion once presented to the terrible characters typed in stereo. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is simply boring (it seems to resume her role from high fidelity, less humor), Crystal plays her same old hyperactive, neurotic and annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part , apparently bored by the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what is supposed to be a "romantic comedy", there is absolutely no relationship between the central characters, let alone the chemistry, and as for the comedy (possible SPOILERS) well, the only moments of slight humor are derived from the role of Cusack in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin - the writer obviously was not able to show any originality. (Spoiler) Azaria was reasonably funny as the Mexican lover and Walken made a pretty funny turn as a parody of an independent dogma-type director - dogma - but these parts made up very little time on the screen and instead (Spoiler) we were treated by Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of most of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was totally disappointed with a film with many good ideas, and at the same time completely reluctant to explore or elaborate on some of them, instead resorting to the same old clich√©s of the kind and even lowering oneself to the depths of humor almost "grossly, adolescent" at times. <br /> <br /> A very poor 4/10.
