I saw this film a long time before the first film release, in a justly empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this still clearly remains in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst you allowed me to look at. <br /> <br /> Acting is far below the standard set by any random group of drunk high school students driven off the road and forced to learn their lines in 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene touched new lows. But after a while, even that dubious pleasure disappeared and had to be really sad.
