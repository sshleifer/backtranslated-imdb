I had high hopes for this because I like Tim Roth. I wasn't happy with this movie. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk some years ago, so I thought this would have had more than a bang. First I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. It looks like his eyebrows have been remodeled for this. His performance was not convincing. He wasn't as good as you'd expect. Tim Roth is beautiful as always here. The Gama thing didn't stick to the original plot that I don't think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. He had a good action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This is not so long but it has become a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this really cheap movie for sale and I always wondered why? Now I know. I was hoping to be swept away, but I wasn't.
