Compared to other Columbo films, this can only be evaluated at 1 (terrible). I honestly don't understand what the other reviewers saw in this awesome movie train crash. It was only through the morbid fascination that I continued to look at him - to see what a bizarre or inept decision the director would have made. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer suggested that it was the only way out of Falk's direction because it interfered with his acting. role. In fact, I think the real reason is the studio bosses, who must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. It is a wonder that they did not kill him.
