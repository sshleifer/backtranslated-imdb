The Radar Men from the Moon is a typical dish of the fifties serial. The special effects are rather cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously jeeps in excess of the second world war with over painted plywood and the like. Acting is just so-so. It inspires the imagination of children, to whom I believe it was directed. By today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a considerable amount of archive material in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
