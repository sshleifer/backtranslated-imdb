This film is similar to the play "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The plot of a ghost wife and a medium is strongly linked to Coward's writing. I am surprised that films of this nature do not recognize the concept of the original writer. I realize that the public might not be aware of the fact that this is a knockoff, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive to produce. I realize when a script is original. I even realize when it is an innovative way to produce a work that has previously been published. There were a few examples mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively cheap form of entertainment. However, they are not please when the taste of the public is taken for granted. In this situation, public taste is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I look forward to better producing film entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I prefer to see the game.
