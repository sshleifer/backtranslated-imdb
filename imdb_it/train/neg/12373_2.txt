The script is so laughable ... this in turn makes the lines of the actors sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed. There is repetition of sentences - "my sweet little daughter of god" and small variations of that line that comes to mind ... and it is only a sloppy dialogue of soap operas. <br /> <br /> Worse, the music is so WRONG! Moreover, the main "theme" of the blues is horribly singular and completely wrong for this. And one feels abused especially because the instrumentation, the plot and the disposition of this theme never change, even when the emotional context of the scene does not. <br /> <br /> Next, whenever it appears, it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Music is trivial, and it is as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom - a low budget Canadian sitcom from the 80s - and this makes us feel like we're on edge of the launch of an advertising spot. <br /> <br /> It's so uncomfortable, there's a lot of overacting and it's a real trait that so many of these characters only use ONE type of NY accent - a strong Bronx accent. I don't know if it is the limited ability of the actors to know only * a * NY accent - or if it is the director's ability to notice such an obvious anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the amateur script with its lead lines that make this whole "movie" ... blow. When any base is unstable and unstable, it is impossible to rely on it without its flaws turning out in exponentially more harmful and unflattering ways.
