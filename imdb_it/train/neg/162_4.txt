a film that tries to be much smarter than its producers can produce. the film transforms and turns into a myriad plot of "surprises" in a desperate attempt to seduce the public to guess, offcourse puncturing the "plot" with smoky scenes that they thought would help long. <br /> <br /> james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and only sleep walks through the film. the same applies to the other "actors". the plot is quite silly and tacky. it is not such a crime, but towards the end, the terrible plots of the plot become boring and boring. <br /> <br /> however, the film manages to arouse some interest in the middle. in all it's worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't worry if you miss this. <br /> <br /> a little lame 4!
