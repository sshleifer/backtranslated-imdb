Aaron Spelling has produced this movie for western television that becomes terribly intriguing for a seventy-three minute film. Play as a likely pilot of the failed series. <br /> <br /> The handsome Clint Walker is the American Marshal Dave Harmon, who wanders the territory of Yuma, Arizona, in time to kill one of the brothers of the local bigwig ranch that is off a driveway. <br /> <br /> Walker takes the other brother to prison. Walker also meets a friendly homeless Mexican boy who sleeps in prison. One night, Andres slumbers when a villain and another man dressed in military blue take their remaining brother to the street and kill him, blocking the murder on Walker. Not good for the first twenty-four hours at work. Walker visits the fort of the local army and collides with the commander's chains. The bigwig feels the death of his brothers, and returns to the city in time to let his chains too. Even the local native population, which was transformed by the army with its meat, remained perched in the area of ​​the chains. With all these chains obtained, Walker still has time to woo the hotel owner. The army guy involved in the murder ends up dead, the local cattle buyer is implicated, the Indians make a lot of hesitant speeches, and the climax causes an unlikely showdown, as Walker has to prove to the city that the villain cattle buyer had a boss, someone we suspected of always being helpful. <br /> <br /> There is a semi-subplot involving the death of Walker's family at the hands of army raiders, and I think this would have been the force behind the series, if it had been collected. Instead, the film ends abruptly, and I kept waiting for the scenes of the exciting episode next week. Because of the fading out for non-existent advertising breaks, the rhythm is all about this and its story jumps into beats. <br /> <br /> Walker is handsome, sturdy and has a deeper voice than a well. The rest of the cast is full of television actors you've probably seen in other TV movies. Much of the action is rather lame and the violence is lukewarm. The first brother killed gets a rifle shot in the middle of the torso, and falls without a scratch on him. I did not expect "Reservoir Dogs", but this is the wrong film to use to teach children the evil of weapons! Speaking of children, the Mexican boy goes from "cute" to "annoying aneurysm" very quickly. <br /> <br /> If you don't like westerns, then you won't like "Yuma". If you like westerns, you won't like "Yuma" yet. I can't recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is unrated, but contains physical violence and armed violence. <br /> <br />
