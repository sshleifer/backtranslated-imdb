I read some exciting reviews here on IMDb and thought I'd take a look at this movie. Disappointed. The positive side is that the male leads are good, and some interesting photographs, but overall this film fails to convince. It seems to be full of its own self-indulgence importance in trying to say something meaningful but it falls very short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess. <br /> <br /> It is one of those films classified as a film noir that can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "A film noir is characterized by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical characters ". <br /> <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losers stumble over each other with their collective problems including mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness etc. And together they conspire to kidnap a child and deceive one another. <br /> <br /> It would have been a much better film if the story was confined more to kidnapping than to kidnapper character failures. I thought the female protagonist was far from her depth and I came across an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> Despite some good moments, I ended up feeling wasted time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
