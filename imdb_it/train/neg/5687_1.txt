Not bad like his movie game adaptations, this piece of stuff isn't much better. <br /> <br /> Boll seems to have a pathological inability to accept not making good films. One of these days the money will end and it will stop inflicting the world with its bombs. <br /> <br /> The acting was sub-par, the dialogue seemed like they were reading TelePrompTers and Boll's special "touches" were seen throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Like all Uwe Boll films, this should not exist. <br /> <br /> Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> Just like Uwe Boll himself shouldn't exist. > _>
