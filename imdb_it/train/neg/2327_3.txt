This movie comes straight out of the dark darkness of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90s by producing terribly bad and bad taste horror films. The most famous disasters in their work are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended and neither is Dr. Mordrid, in fact. The hyperactive director Charles Band has arrived at the right company for his film. Dr. Mordrid is incredibly stupid and mischievous and almost completely devoid of a sense of humor. I only saw it because it stars in Jeffrey Combs. I learned that it can have several disadvantages if you are a fan. For every good movie, it seems to have made 5 lower ones. However, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers. A good one who has been here for 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr. Mordrid) and an evil called Kabal. He wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason that I have already forgotten. The combs receive their instructions from the mentor. That "boy" exists only of a pair of eyes in space. Very very poor, that is! Every now and then a flash of blinding light is shown on the screen, but it is the only kind of special effects that this film has. The whole thing is just a piece of whining and annoying and when the two wizards finally meet, it's over before you know it ... I would have expected the evil wizard to at least fight a little, but nooooooo .. .. In some scenes, you can really discover some originality and creativity (such as Jeffrey's lecture on the influence of the moon on criminals) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects (like the crow that you call Edgar Allen), but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a huge Jeffrey fan and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he certainly doesn't have to put up a stupid maillot for that.
