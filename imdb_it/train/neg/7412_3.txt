I like cheese horror movies. I don't care if the acting is sub-par or if the monsters seem trivial. I liked this movie except for the feeling of disorientation from the beginning of the film to the end. Look, I don't need a 10-page dissertation or a sign with large letters explaining a plot for me. But Dark Floors takes the "what this movie is about?" what at a completely new level (annoying). What is this film about? <br /> <br /> This is not exceptionally frightening or thrilling, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.
