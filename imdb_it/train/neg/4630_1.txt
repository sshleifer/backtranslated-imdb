Released in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, this is an inept little melodramatic crime with an inept sexual exploitation. As usual for vintage films, there is a fair amount of undressing and dressing without reason, accompanied by lousy music, annoying narratives and uncomfortable editing. The coffee shop scene lays the harrowing foundations, as we jump back and forth between the characters to avoid seeing them really utter their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the voice of the character out of bounds! The beautiful 50s Misty Ayers takes off her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action begins. It is continually accompanied by what is apparently the series music from the romantic to the western to the dishes for the mother, mixed at random to produce, among other things, the most captivating cigarette lighting ever captured on the film. Watch as he touches it! Watch as he hits the game! Will it inhale or be captured by the Apaches? Only time will tell! The film tells the sordid story of how Sally is tricked into working in a brothel, falls in love with a drug and can't escape. For some reason, we are treated with some of the most bored and boring prostitutes ever engaged in filming, literally nailing or knitting rather than entertaining customers. An astonishingly lame comedy (the drunk lady accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) And the acting of the silent film doesn't help. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, even in the Something Weird Video marquee. It is really a cinematic curiosity for those interested in the history of cinema - a bad cinema.
