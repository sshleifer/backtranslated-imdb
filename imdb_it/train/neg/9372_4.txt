This is a typical late Universal Horror movie: it's technically complacent, if by numbers, with a cookie cutter plot and some serious overacting. The most interesting part of this film is the acrobatic casting of Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disease as the "monster" of the film. It is sad to see this man exploited, but he probably made good use of the money they paid him. Hatton is less terrifying than the studio hoped, because more often I felt pity for fear or even contempt. Martin Koslack is on board as a crazy film artist, and he's very funny in this part. First I enjoy seeing Koslack in anything; for some reason the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is the absurd interpretation of the film in the art world. Here we are shown bad art critics who enjoy breaking artists; this is alongside the male hero of the film who is an "artist" who paints ... take this ... pin up girls. Somehow the work of our hero is reviewed side by side with the absurd sculpture of the villain. The film's critical leader is also funny, who at one point claims to despise the hero's pin-up art because "women do not exist" to which our heroine responds with the certainty that the critic does not come out enough. Finally, there is a bit of subplot about the domestication of heroin (which is itself an art criticism) by the protagonist ... completely anti-feminist and ridiculous to testify. Overall this film is a rather mediocre image with some funny elements.
