I am both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this film is so precise about Vietnam, and they have never been there. This film is true about the whole Vietnam War, as the Rodney King is true of all the cops. Yes, bad things happen (and they happen), but in general people are just like you and me. They have a moral, they are not killing machines, not everyone does drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They have happened much more rarely than the "advertising campaign" led you to believe. Oliver Stone has a talent for making films that show the Vietnam War as this brutal bloodbath, but they are based as much in reality as in Star Wars. If you honestly believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: The Viet Cong and NVA have done much worse things for southern Vietnam than any soldier in the US military ever did. Fact: World War II soldiers treated the enemy much worse in general than soldiers did in Vietnam, and were WELCOMED when they returned home. The good Americans who have served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; although the war was fought badly from a political point of view, nobody could have asked more of our soldiers, and it is a serious disservice to say that this kind of "mostly true" fiction is the way things really were there.
