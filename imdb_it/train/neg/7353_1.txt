Watching it now is still so bizarre and sexist as a memory. it comes from an age when girls were "Dolly Birds" and basically men's toys. It is difficult to understand that it comes from the Hammer studios and the fact that it is available on DVD when good films are not. Our nations are ashamed where the working class is portrayed as a forced dismissal or worse! The problem is that you can't help but feel nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus. Do you try to retain stomach contents when you see olives in a soft? A "cheeky" blue nightgown or something like Shirley Bassey wore for a concert in 1972. This film shows the illegal practice of towing a combined motorcycle from a red double-decker bus, which I was told was not a Routemaster but in Bristol. <br /> <br /> Just watch not worry about looking at something decent, like Porridge or Dad's army ... or a fly crawling on a wall.
