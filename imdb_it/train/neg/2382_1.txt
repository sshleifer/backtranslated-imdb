There are films like "Plan 9" that are so bad that they have a charm about them, there are some like "Waterworld" that have the same inexplicable attraction as a car accident, and there are some like "Desperate living" that hate to admit it, love Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The assembled cast has enough talent to make any plot accessible, and from what I've been told, the book is fun. <br /> <br /> So how could this film be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems that the director has assembled a cast of names with no other constraint than the one the 20-year-old will bring. Then tell them to do their best imitations of Kevin Costner. Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure you keep the vast expanses of America from being interesting in any way. Finally, give your brother-in-law the assembly job, because the meat packaging plant has just fired him. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This film now defines the basement for me. It's so ugly, it's not even good to be bad.
