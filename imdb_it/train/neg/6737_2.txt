If Deborah Messing hadn't already been launched as "Grace", this could be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a maid frustrated with problems, hiring a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) who reads in an article in Time magazine to travel to London for her sister's wedding in London. How new is this plot? <br /> <br /> Neither amusing nor remotely romantic, the date of the marriage runs on the plot of the deceitful sex by the bride and the witness and paid for companions to pass the film as Four Marriages without Hugh, and certainly , an endless affair for the naive bridegroom who is ignorant of his wife's sexual history (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30 - a woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves on another fake boyfriend is simply the reaffirmation of her television series. If this woman is an actress, take a role that does not rearrange what is already in the early evening. <br /> <br /> A lot of drunken female ties, cricket and Mulroney visual jokes in a towel (nice!), But the movie is boring with the obvious happy ending. The expected continuation of Messing: Divorce Date.
