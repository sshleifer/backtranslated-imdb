The plot of 7EVENTY 5IVE involves university students who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly (to them, if not to the horror fans) makes them tease. The HISTORY of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that of a horror film that has had a little bit of promise, unfortunately overtaken by a really bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun, if somehow a silly, old-fashioned story was derailed at first by its filmmakers' mistaken belief that the audience would enjoy watching a group of rich and plaintive kids who complained to each other for most of the movie's running time. With the exception of a police detective played by Rutger Hauer, (in a secondary role that is designed primarily to add the film's only stellar power), each character on the screen is a different race of young A-hole. <br /> <br /> Male and female, black and white, straight and gay, a whole group of superficial and acute university students carry most of the film's narrative. Worse still, since the story deals with a PARTY game that went wrong, most of the time the scenes are completely full of these little b ***** ds. For this reason, there are few pauses for the spectator, who must endure the angry sniping of the subtly drawn protagonists. Even if at least some of these people are supposedly friends, invariably all the characters interact in a very hostile way, long before a real conflict actually arose. This leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film: the public, intent on worrying about leads, instead not only applauds the anonymous killer, but wishes it to have arrived to begin collecting the empty brats much earlier. > <br /> The real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually had some potential. Visually okay. Debut filmmakers Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood. They also manage to provide some amusing and competent moments of a classic 80s style. Surprisingly, the cast of the production is also quite skilled. It is not that actors are unable to express realistic human emotions; it's simply that the script (written by newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, which went much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) is short of these moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended, as its familiar premise and a few chills cannot overcome the bad taste left by a story driven by a bunch of unpleasant characters. In this tepid mystery, the real mystery is why someone should be interested in a group of young people who can't even enjoy one another.
