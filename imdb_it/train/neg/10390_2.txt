I just rented and watched this movie just to see what's going on. So here's what my reactions to it are. It is easy to see that this is a low-budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this film is about a woman who takes revenge on her rapists. This concept could be a very provocative film if done right. However, the film does not disturb me or disturb me at all. He just bored me. This film could easily be reduced to less than 45 minutes. All the scenes are mainly there to fill the time, like those scenic scenes and some scenes I described below. <br /> <br /> ************ Contains spoiler ***** ******* I find the rape scenes quite tamed. I don't know if I saw the cut or untrimmed version, if such a version actually exists. I also found a lot of holes in the already badly written plot. Here is a list at the top of my mind. <br /> <br /> Because rapists don't rape Jennifer during the night when she left home to find out what those noises are. It would be a great time. <br /> <br /> Because they don't just rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer's suffering for so long. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing in that way. <br /> <br /> I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and returned to her home. Perhaps to show that these rapists are really stupid. <br /> <br /> These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job, they shouldn't send a cowardly idiot to do the job. /> <br /> Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rapists left? What should be the first thing that appears in many people's minds, especially for someone who is a writer. <br /> <br /> Why didn't these rapists feel the danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive? <br /> <br /> I find it really incredible that a slim woman like Camille can pull up a tree man and hang him ************************ Fine spoiler ************ <br /> <br /> But hey, this film is not without merit, Camille Keaton is wonderful and I can hear one of the funniest lines I've heard of recent when Matthew protests to return home and kills Jennifer, "Why me? Because I, I haven't even done it !!!"
