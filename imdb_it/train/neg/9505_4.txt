I'm not going to criticize the film. There is not much to talk about. He has action scenes on animals that were probably pretty amazing right now. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. It's a bit light and not particularly nice. But it's fine. He is the man in that lion cage. We know that when he can't take his time away from his lions to take care of his girlfriend, he'll end up on an island with her and save the day. Someone said before that it's a history lesson. The circus scenes are of another day, especially the children who roam. I didn't realize that, already in the thirties, they were sailing on three tree-lined schooners. It looked like something from the 1860s. I guess it's the archive material they had. No wonder the thing is wrecked. They are always talking about fixing it. There's even an airship. He talks to us a bit about the male female relationships at the time, a kind of stupid nonsense. But if you don't take it too seriously, you can enjoy watching it.
