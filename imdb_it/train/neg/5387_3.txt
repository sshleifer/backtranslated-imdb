In an instant when it seemed to be interesting, it never arrived. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another point, without any sense (if there was one it was very boring). There was no action, suspense or horror and the characters were rather ruthless, so there was no care what happened to him. <br /> <br /> All together the film was rather boring. <br /> <br /> I like it to be a 3/10. I like the fact that it wasn't a shaky and shaky video camera and if there was music it didn't bother me like some bad movies and the acting wasn't horrendous.
