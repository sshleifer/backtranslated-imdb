What happened in the making of this film so as to end up as a total disaster? Only a year after "The Breakfast Club", a brilliant film with many of the same actors as "St. Elmo's Fire" (which among other things looked and acted in the latter as if they were still the misfits of high school from the first but without the grasp or discipline in portraying their roles. <br /> <br /> It was directing or writing, since it was the same person (Joel Schumacher), it must be both, but then Schumacher gave us " The Phantom of the Opera "," Phone Booth "," A Time to Kill "and two films by Batman," Batman and Robin "and" Batman Forever "ranging from good to great director, has no genius, no comedy is worth nothing and is very far from what is truly precious in life. <br /> <br /> Example: The character Wendy (a rich little girl with a heart to do well and helps the less fortunate ones played by Mare Winningham) reveals to Billy (a drunken drunk who betrays his wife and his girlfriend, drinks too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately interpreted by Rob Lowe) who is still a virgin. Billy really sees a challenge and a possible conquest, but Wendy "is not ready". Wendy, in fact, is not ready, it is difficult to believe that she is in this clique of friends. Later in history, when Billy, whose wife left him taken by his son and married, he somehow treated some of his lives together. Billy is leaving for New York, abandoning and abandoning all parental responsibility for his little daughter, convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect "farewell gift" from her to him. And Wendy, who works as a social worker to help destroyed families, does not seem to be implemented by this despot at all. Give me a break. The only thing she can give once, does she give a loser who is leaving her family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and moving moment. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples in which there is a complete disconnection between what is real and value is thrown overboard and the acts are made to resemble virtues. I think some might say that "it was the 1980s" but I remember that in the 1980s men began to be held responsible for the children they had generated in marriage or outside. /> <br /> I think this movie is so ugly because it's so out of sync with what's really precious and right. <br /> <br /> As for the technique (not the story), it was terrible as well. It is disconnected and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited for 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and leaps in time simply don't make sense. Collect what's in the editing room floor, put it back in place and the film will probably run much better ... but it's still a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have it) or maybe he was out of his mind when it came to writing the script for St Elmo's Fire or maybe this group of actors took the set and he went his way - that's what I really think happened.
