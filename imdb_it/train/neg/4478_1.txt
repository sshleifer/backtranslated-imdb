I didn't expect much from this movie, a fun diversion. Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a plausible modern story, pretty and tasty, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film has decided to throw away the talents of the people involved in a simulation version that is so watered with the starting material that it is incredible that they had the courage to call it Wuthering Heights. Ignore the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially unpredictable, mostly unpleasant and often cruel to each other. The nature of certain characters changes - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, had no conniving bone in her body - they stripped her blind idealism and turned it into an intriguing whore. Heathcliff is a horrible person who psychologically tortures most people on his way, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving his daughter in his care. The dialogue is trivial and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver some of these with straight faces. Instead of deep or real emotions, we know they mean something when they shout it in someone's face. I read the criticisms of the 1990s version, "Emerald Bridges by Emily Bronte", with Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, who said that it transformed an intensely dark Gothic story into a grimy ripper of bodices. Comments slightly valid, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic structure of history to offer bum bum on the beach to really bad music.
