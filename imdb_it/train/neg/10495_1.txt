I think Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the courage to go even a meter away from a croc. <br /> <br /> But everything in this film is ugly. By discouraging jokes, people being eaten and the President's skit make the film one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> It's a really bad movie that you have to stay away from. All the "jokes" are so youthful that you'll find yourself laughing because they're so stupid. The plot is so bad you wonder if the writer is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat it after seeing it.
