I gave 'Kôhî jikô' a low score not because it was a bad movie, but because it doesn't do anything worthwhile. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before, but for the uninitiated (including myself) "Kôhî jikô" is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was very, very much in 1962) The film is an extremely scarce work ... it contains very few dialogues, stories, music or emotions. <br /> <br /> Yo Hitoto plays "Yoko" to unemployed, a vagabond character who spends his time in his local café or vaguely investigating a Taiwanese composer she likes. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend, who works in a CD shop and occasionally appreciates his interest in trains. And this is all. <br /> <br /> Let's watch as Yoko drinks coffee by herself ... walks around ... waits for a train ... takes a train ... falls asleep on the train. The kind of worldly reality that anyone in Japan can see every day. Capturing these ordinary moments of life of these characters, but without any meaning to these cartoons is a film absolutely useless to do or to watch.
