As the faux-Russian scientist says two-thirds of the film, "I came for science". This sums up the reason I saw this film - anything involving a half-man and half-hammer shark certainly deserves a serious empirical investigation by an aspiring impartial scientist. Or, as they say in biz, my girlfriend's brother had the remote control and the rest is history. To say that the special effects were bad would be a bad service in the field of special effects. This is 2005, it is not difficult to shoot an automotive scene without a bluastonic background. Yes, this was fascinating and state of the art when Hitchcock was filming "The Birds", but in 2005 it seems like just a low budget. Save me the economic attempt of Sci-Fi and give me the service of actually trying the voluntary suspension of disbelief. <br /> <br /> However, having seriously defamed the general concept of this film, let me tell you again, as sad as it may seem, this is probably worth it. If nothing else, it's a tour de force of bad Sci-Fi - it's worth educating for the new movie fan and certainly worthy of a refresher course for those who have seen some movies in their day. <br /> <br /> The mad hunchback mad scientist with a hammerhead transceiver who thinks it's a good idea to put a tablespoon of blood in the nearby water makes me question not only humanity's intelligence, but also the ability of "B" film producers to come up with a plausible remote movie plot. <br /> <br /> This film has been satisfying almost one of my objectionable objections for a long time - the bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If it were not 2005, I would like to be dead that this film was a sort of madly poor metamorphosis for the Cold War. I mean, you could also have Khan on the deck of a Klingon Bird of Prey by inserting smoothies in Chekhov's ear. <br /> <br /> One of the film's most moving lines is when the chick without a bra insists that the Charlton Heston lookalike "waits for Tom" while he is trying to lift the helicopter from the ground. The fact is that Tom is wasting his bad sunglasses with his endless banana clip attached to his Kalashnikov, or AK-47, to put it simply. <br /> <br /> As the mad scientist says towards the end of the film, "my goal is to evolve the human species" - suffice it to say that this film has only contributed to the devolution of the human race. The weak Freudian references pronounced by the mad scientist while preparing the female protagonist to be paired with a hammerhead shark are a simple reminder of the fact that even in the worst case of science fiction we can find something to laugh about.
