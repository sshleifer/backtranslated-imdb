This is an embarrassment for everyone and everything that is used to make this joke. Personally, I don't care in one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent or how many other people find her fascinating. Just like a movie, this is something that would not even get a positive grade in film school. The script is a mess, the acting is atrocious, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-writer of "Bottle Rocket") did this makes me wonder what the hell he was thinking. He did "Old School" for crying out loud! This doesn't even belong in the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please, for whatever reason DO NOT LOOK AT THIS! I see that there is a comment that is so bad that it's okay, but frankly it's too kind. When we stop seeing the singers who obviously can't act, they keep trying, I hope it ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent actors (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As for the plot, well, it's almost non-existent and poorly written and written (yes, I know it's another remake). I strongly doubt that anyone will remember anything about this. Please, whatever you do, don't waste your time, but if you do, you're sorry for the ACTUAL actors involved for wasting their time making this bomb. Jessica Simpson, you're pretty, but keep singing, even if I'm not very enthusiastic about it. And whoever made this film, I wouldn't put it in your resume. 1/10 because you can't give a zero.
