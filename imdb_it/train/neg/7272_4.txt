The film is a bit boring. It is primarily a silent film, with most of the story provided through a series of voice-overs. While making a silent film like this is not a bad idea, this is one of those films in which the lack of dialogues and repetitive initial scenes make it simply boring. You don't understand the reason for the boredom until you see it clearly in the photo, and it's too late. The first 40 minutes of a movie is something of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn, and an unimaginative soft porn. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes starts to make sense, but it's too late, because at that point the audience is lost. There are some beautiful location shots at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I have often wondered why there are no more movies filmed there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields that give the campus a very unearthly atmosphere. My biggest problem with the film is that the director / screenwriter made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard to how a viewer who doesn't know the story would see it. You can't ignore the public when you tell a story.
