I watched a lot of cartoons or animated films because I have a little girl who likes to watch TV. I started watching this movie to see if I'd like my baby to look ... and not. At first I thought it was as cute as the Bambi movie, but all the while it was like insinuating that the duck was a homosexual. The information said they were kidding him because he wasn't good at sports, but he wasn't. It just seems like a movie made for children to learn to be well being gay. He was also very sad, regarding the daddy's dad and all the rest. I don't know, I guess if you're gay you'd like it, but I don't think I'll watch it again with my baby.
