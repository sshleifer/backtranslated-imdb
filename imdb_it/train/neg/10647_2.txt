Tarzan's latest film starring Johnny Weissmuller (which seems surprisingly aged a year after "Tarzan and the Huntress") is bad, despite all the curiosities that can be added to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO has tried to give Weissmuller a big farewell, shooting in a splendid scenario of Mexico, with a star of that country (Andrea Palma) and the award-winning director of photography Gabriel Figueroa, and bringing the prestigious composer to the stage Dimitri Tiomkin the score. Although it could cost less for shooting abroad, it seems more expensive than any other RKO film in the series, taking advantage of the beaches of Acapulco and the real pyramids like Aquatania and with impressive decorations for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep rocks.) Kurt Neumann should have remained as director instead of Robert Florey, which gives him a very slow pace. Neumann had done a great job with "Tarzan and the Amazons", "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and the Huntress", and ended his career directing the classic "The Fly" the year before his death; while Florey became a television director, after a career of a few notable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimp who plays Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, a hideous postman who sings horrendous songs (which have a Caribbean air, in a place supposed to be African Mexico!) Boring and definitely of questionable taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller's Tarzan.
