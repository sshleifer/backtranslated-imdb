Although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers who parade on the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify made me look at my watch for only 20 minutes in the movie (and more than once after). The development of the plot is slow and complex, the verbal diarrhea of ​​the protagonist's only friend is practically unbearable, the basic quality of most of the characters' actions and the bold manner in which they are dealing is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Ventura Pons to put forward the crasses of psychologically disabled people. However, this fake sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters mistreat and despise each other for well-founded reasons that manifest themselves during that film. In the AMIOTA AMOR we are forced to follow the meanders of a truly subnormal intelligence while chasing a severely depressed and detached woman. Presumably this is due to his own depression, but the script does not support it. Won't I give away the rest of the story in case there were masochists out there ?? Is he cured of his obsession or is the woman shocked by his depression through his unwavering attention? Even though I looked at the whole thing, it never mattered to me to worry about any of these for a moment. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, BAD dialogue, fragile philosophy, etc. ?? camera work was pretty good and seems to have been inspired by the DOGMA group. Even the make-up seemed to aim to show these players in a rough and gritty light as it is the worst that has seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of his films (while in person he is really attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose if the idea was that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society, so we can be grateful for not being part of it, so Pons has achieved his goal. The barrage of almost identical sex scenes was a real waste of movies (if the actors had been filmed, but once in blue-green clothes the background behind them could have been changed in the study of special effects for a pittance). It is true that I heard a lot about the male audience as they sat, but an objective view shows that it was not the real purpose of those scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and look at something else.
