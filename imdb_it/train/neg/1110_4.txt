An hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds in this film and I decided it was rather lame. It was right after Hopalong (Chris Lybbert) left his horse from a tree to rejoin the good boy. I was quite confused by the whole Hopalong Cassidy / Great Bar 20 finding that didn't translate into anything. Obviously, the name Coppola in the credits could do nothing to guarantee success here, even with more than one list. <br /> <br /> If you do it until the end of the film, you will probably end up asking yourself the same questions I asked. What exactly was the glove hook? What's up with the rodeo scenery? Who was the stranger to represent? Why did they make this movie? <br /> <br /> I could probably go on but my energies have been drained. Look, there's already a western called "The Gunfighter" from 1950 with a guy named Gregory Peck as the title character. Watching it will make you feel as good as watching this makes you feel sick. What I can recommend.
