Full marks for the content of this film, as an Englishman I did not know that there was segregation in the US Navy during the Second World War. A very brave attempt to bring this fact into the world. However, the film is pathetic, the direction is non-existent, the acting is wooden and the script is only one clich√© after another. I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I sat down and reduced from the beginning to the end in the bad way this had been put together. This may have been a great film, the story for many of us outside the United States was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which may have changed people's attitudes, has been wasted on a low budget and poorly directed film. I only hope that, in the future, one of the major studies will take this issue and do it justice.
