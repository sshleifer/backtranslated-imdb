Oh, what a bad, bad, bad movie! Written by and interpreted by Sylvester Stallone, which should have been enough and represented by too many rock climbing scenes, dizziness, falls and villains chewing the scene and a failed robbery. There are two plots, both lame. One involves a failed traumatic rescue and the other involves bad people who destroy an airplane for the loot and kill several harmless people whenever possible. The usual reliable John Lithgow, perhaps depressed by the sheer vitality of the product, boils down to grinning and calling those who don't care about "Bostid!" in a vague approximation of an English accent. Janine Turner, who was lively and enigmatic when she played Maggie in Northern Exposure, is sadly wasted as a rescuer and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscular. No lines without death in this. Not even living lines.
