I tried to watch this movie without being able to really sit down, because it's likely to have a "good" message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to a particular interpretation of the Scriptures. An interpretation, in my opinion, will deceive many people. Also, I'm a movie freak and the acting in this movie was totally unacceptable. Never before had I wanted a negative score to evaluate a film. So if you want to be preached incessantly by those without authority, then by all means, take this movie. This comment is also a warning to people who love or love scifi, because the title will also deceive many people. This was an unfortunate film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were wasted. The only redeemable quality of the film is that it made me realize that probably the "Time Machine" character would have to show a little more moral indignation for the strange behavior of those of his future.
