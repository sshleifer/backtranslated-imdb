First of all, this plot is too exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, the snobby girl comes in, everything seems lost, the girl pulls out, everyone loves her again and so on. Throw the right thing, an attractive male crushing heroin, plus the problems with just one parent and it's so predictable that you can practically act together. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to dissect classical music. They send out the message that all those involved in classical music are firm and snobbish and narrow-minded - in fact, I don't remember the quote exactly, but at one point in the film, Holly says, "Because they have been so tense .. . so classic? "It's really offensive how classical music is labeled this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I've been there dozens of times, but the only reason I can think of doing this movie is to promote Britney Spears. there is really no sense. <br /> <br /> And oh yes, while the actress who played Holly (I'm not sure she was really singing it or not) had a pretty good voice, it wasn't as amazing as they were making it - especially when he was playing the chorus. He supported all the time. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
