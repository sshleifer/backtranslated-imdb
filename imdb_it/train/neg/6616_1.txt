I have to tell you, I'm not an authority on Bollywood films and I've only seen a handful. However, if you've never seen one, DO NOT start with this! I really appreciated the ones I saw up to this, but I couldn't stand it. I must also tell you in advance that I could not finish this film - it was so annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character called "Rambha" in the film. It's even more annoying than Jar Jar Jar - which I never thought would be possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think it should have been a comic relief. Instead, he just scratched my nerves and wanted me to die ... slowly! His voice, his ways and his dislike - he just didn't seem to shut up and dominate every scene he was in - and needed to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had the extraordinary ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I'm not kidding - there was a scene where several unarmed men took a small army of boys with these assault rifles !! And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat the pimps !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" trivial !! <br /> <br /> 3. The film was so damn loud, in my face and intense - it practically made my brain bleed !! It was as if the film had been made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... this film is clearly designed for someone who can't make a film with the plot and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made no sense ... none! <br /> <br /> Maybe if you're the biggest action and Bollywood fan you can put up with this movie, but as for me I can see why it's in the infamous Bottom 100 list of IMDb. Wow ... this movie is bad AND intensely bad !!
