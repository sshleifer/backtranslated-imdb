Personally I think this show is quite cheap. Some of the actors are terrible. They end up and look fake. I can always tell how it will end up within the first 10 minutes or less of looking because they make it so clearly transparent. It is not written very well. I like to see him laugh at it. You know the saying "Is it so bad that it's good?" Well, this saying applies to this show. I also like to look only to see if I'm right when I imagine how it will end. So far I've been right every time. It's like a little game I play. It's nice when you're bored and you want to laugh at something.
