This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in a 2004 interview that when he is making films, he wants to make music, and when he is making music, he wants to make movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Kusturica said in the same interview that for him the dialogues in the movies are like noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like a music video for the first 30 minutes and in some places later, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promise me this" has no plot. I was waiting for this film with great expectations, because I read that the script was written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite writers, who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise", and to my regret, I saw only two dialogues, which I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director for making his chaotic music video for the music of his son Stribor. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the scripts for "Time of the Gypsies" and "Black Cat White Cat") said in an interview, that Kusturica never follows the script. "Black cat white cat" was the only script, for which Kusturica said, that will not touch her. According to Gordan Mihic, after all Kusturica returns to the script, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. And I think this is the case with "Promise me this". He would have to follow the script of Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is advertised as a "comedy", but there are very few moments that made me laugh. Comic moments are in the same style as "black cat white cat", but they are not funny at all. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black cat white cat" was written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> However, I know some people, who liked "Promise me this", find it very positive film.
