I'm a little torn up about DARK ANGEL. The film seems to be a "loving" tribute to the biggest pin-up ever - but there is so little real "content" that the film itself is practically useless. I really can't see what the motivation or "point" of this film is - because there is very little biographical information in the narrative - so those who don't know much about Bettie won't know much more after seeing DARK ANGEL or ... <br /> <br /> The film basically tells the last years of Bettie's career in slavery modeling. Almost the entire film is composed of "re-enactments" of some of Bettie's most famous photo shoots and loops. These re-enactments literally occupy 75% of the films in real time and give virtually no Bettie vision as a person. The film briefly touches on its legitimate short-term pursuits, and its subsequent decision to abandon the "business" and become religious - but all this is practically ignored to show scenes of long re-enactment and pulled out ... <br /> < br /> DARK ANGEL is not a horrible film - there is no substance in it. The other problem is that the actress who plays Bettie looks very much like her in more distant pictures: up close it's a no-go. The other thing that annoyed me is that, although Bettie did several topless shots, the only nudity in the film was a short sequence of segments in a zoo during the end credits. The film itself is obviously extremely low budget, but it does what it can set and costumes within the limits of the film, so I don't mind anything. The acting is rather wooden and not memorable by everyone. In fact, the most memorable thing about the whole film for me, was to note during the closing credits that the actor who played the real name of Irving Klaw is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. I can't say I recommend this too much unless you are a true Bettiefile completista and possess something that concerns you. And if you are that bad, then you still need to seek treatment ... 4/10
