You can call this a flop, and this is also very big! The quality is not associated with the words National Lampoon, but at least the rumors of Vacation and Animal House have been fun, but this offer has been their most amazing feature to date that I've seen. Ugh! The three-piece story madly attempts to parody the clichés and stereotypes that have flooded the Hollywood genre films, which turn out to be completely unpleasant and unsharply. <br /> <br /> "Growing Yourself". - Jason, a corporate lawyer, decides to quit his job and part with his wife so that they can both grow and do what they have always wanted to do. This is life, as Jason sees it and takes care of children, but his decision to follow this path may not be the right one. <br /> <br /> Talking about lead, boring and rigid. The real interest is only the small performance of the adorable Diane Lane. The satirical element here seems to indicate something rather than deliver it. Silly humor is tense, flat and particularly senseless. Peter Riegert keeps him very impassive in the lead role and Teresa Ganzel in his role. <br /> <br /> "Success Wanters" - After having just finished the collage, Dominique Corsair gets a job as a stripper and is raped with a little butter by the Presidents of the dairy companies. For recovery, he is interested in the margarine industry and approaches the "top" virtually. <br /> <br /> Probably the best of the three, but the competition was not too good. I want to go more subtle with his sexual and power-oriented tone, but they feel even more vulgar and forced. The idea had something promising and inventive to build, but the languid rhythm begins to wear out in the end and disastrous dialogue does not happen. humor tries us, but more often it does not come away, despite the hunger. The seductive Ann Dusenberry is rather cold and manipulative everywhere (well after the painful ordeal) and likes to flaunt it all gracefully Even the skimpy dress seems to have a complete workout for opening half the story: popping in amusing minor cameos has played by Dick Millar, Mary Woronov, Olympia Dukakis, Fred Willard, Robert Culp and a favorite turn by Joe Spinell. <br /> <br /> "Municipalists" - A series of the killer who leaves behind every copy of the driving license, is tracked down by an inexperienced and naive policeman and his grizzled old partner. However, the young policeman learns that being tough is the only way to go, when the couple meets one situation after another. <br /> <br /> Stupid! Oh yeah. Of course, if you're going to spoof something extremely exaggerated, make sure the laughs spread. Obviously they forgot it! Even at his 30 minutes in a row, the boy drags him! Robby Benson's provocative performance has become rather overbearing with a tiring Richard Widmark who has done little as his companion. Christopher Lloyd implies the role of the serial killer, but his ironic and nice performance is very interesting and shows practically the other clues. Elisha Cook Jr., Rhea Perlman and Harry Reems appear. When the jokes arrive, they really feel out of sync and become rather stale with the repetitiveness of making fun of these cop clichés. <br /> <br /> In all, the idiotic material sewn with its skits looks like disposable, and the unbearable script is basically inept and without spirit. Only one or two few lines come out of each segment, but in reality there are too many cheap stinkers or simple mistakes that remain in your head. This is because it becomes practically what he is trying to attract and this in practice shows in every story. Loses the view Exhibitions range from warm to cold, but those who can't deny the embarrassment they feel on most of their faces. The first taste of the director Bob Giraldi is an insipid one for "Growing Yourself", but "Success Wanters" has shown some small improvements of slight effectiveness. Henry Jaglom does a work frayed from "municipal" work. The vividly coarse drawings by Rick Meyerowitz that open the film are clearly designed and continue to define style and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This low-bunk comedy defeats it by exaggerating, with the main interest derived from the family cameos. But really, it's worth going through this putrid and restless attitude, just to locate them. Well, it depends on you.
