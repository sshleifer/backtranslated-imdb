I agree with other comments from users as the two main roles were well interpreted, namely the guy who played Gary Gillmore and the role of Giovanni. Too bad the story was so boring. Not hearing about the story, I didn't know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole film spoke, spoke and talked about their mom and dad. The only interesting scenes were the flashbacks in which the father would lose his temper. That was the only interest I had from this whiner.
