This film is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following may seem like a spoiler, but it only describes a great class of film) There is the passionate and wise main character, his foolish but well-meaning companion with his misplaced attempts at humorous comments, the initial-hostile but soon the splendid lady who makes the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the beloved hostages taken, and of course the wicked inattentive opponent with his brutal servants softened. Everyone has already seen tons of these films, and "National Treasure" is like one of them, with only a slightly modified shell. Every turn in history was easily predictable (and I can assure you that they are not the clearest tool in the warehouse). I'm tired enough to be deceived when I leave the cinema from a Hollywood movie, and if you've ever felt that way, pay attention to my warning; stay miles away from this movie.
