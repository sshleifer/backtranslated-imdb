The identical twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen became famous on sit-coms like "Two of a Kind", I had never seen them before, but I had an idea of ​​what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically the sisters Hunter Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a summer internship program, but not long after starting their work they are immediately dismissed for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company in which they work, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their work, and they slowly prove to be useful assets and talented artists (fashion), and help to stop a bad man who takes over the company. She played Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso in the role of Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. It can be said that this film was made to go directly to the video, the work with the camera is completely maladjusted, and it doesn't help when you want to admire the attractions of Rome. In fact the background is the only good thing to look at, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before I saw that they would not interest me in any way (theirs is not even that cute), this is gushing awful of junk movies. Poor enough!
