Also known in a different form as "House of Exorcism", this ramshackle little movie takes itself so seriously that it kills any entertainment value <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> The reserve plot involves the European tourist Elke Sommer who has a chance <br /> to run with Telly Savalas, who looks just like the devil she saw on a fresco in the square . Sommer receives a lift to a mysterious house <br /> in the country, where Savalas appears to be the butler of <br /> <br />. There, she is mistaken for a long-dead woman, and the real theatrical <br /> <br /> of the soap opera begins. The husband of the blind matriarch of the house <br /> <br /> had a relationship with the dead woman, who was the girlfriend of the son of the matriarch of <br /> <br />. The couple who gave Sommer the ride? <br /> <br /> Well, the woman is giving the driver, uh, "back seat driving <br /> <br /> lessons", and the husband knows and does not care. In the end, <br /> <br /> most of the cast is killed, Sommer is drugged and raped, <br /> <br /> flees and the viewer is led to a climax aboard a void <br / > <br /> airplane ... which must have been similar to the empty theaters where this thing <br /> <br /> played. <br /> <br /> The alternative version of this, "House of Exorcism," has scenes added that involves a priest. <br /> <br /> The VHS copy of this, by Elite Entertainment, is crystal clear and <br /> <br /> letterbox. There are "extras" after the credits; deleted sex <br /> <br /> and blood scenes. <br /> <br /> The direction of Mario Bava is fast and furious, but his script is terrible. There are a little bit of cooked ideas, abandoned plots, and <br /> <br /> jaw-dropping comfort that does nothing but push this thing <br /> <br /> into a sort of forward direction. You have life as puppets for <br /> <br /> practicing funerals, the blind matriarch does not do all that is blind, <br /> <br /> and Savalas has the same lollipops he had in "Kojak" (who scare you, baby?). The project seems to have two stars of the name, so it wrote the <br /> script quickly, something that happens in Hollywood in a daily event <br /> <br /> now. Savalas seems completely lost, offering his <br /> <br /> lines and wishing his character had not died in "The Dirty <br /> <br /> Dozen". Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot, but <br /> <br /> his character is a blank, I use the term "character" freely. The only thing we know about her is her name. <br /> <br /> This is a really weird movie, and your reaction might depend on <br /> <br /> how heavy you are in Eurohorror and Kojak. I for one can't <br /> <br /> recommend "Lisa and the Devil." <br /> <br /> This is unrated and includes all the extras at the end of the VHS <br /> <br /> copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual assault, strong turmoil <br />, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content and adult situations <br /> <br />
