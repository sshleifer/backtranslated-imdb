I don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for fighting scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fighting scenes, but not vice versa. <br /> <br /> The story was decent, but it moved too slowly for my taste. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes, lasting only a couple of minutes each. The last fight was a little longer, but by then I was so bored that I didn't even notice it.
