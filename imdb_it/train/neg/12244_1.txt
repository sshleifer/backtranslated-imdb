This movie is terrible. CGI is the low-cost gray-green CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray spot. The worst is that no effort is made to make him walk or look alive. It is above all a photographed CGI that is inserted in the scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI smudge on the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen many of the lousy Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from the terrible lack of special effects, the cast is made up of the typical low-cost actors who probably work as waiters / waitresses at local diners while waiting for their big breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the villains is trying to sexually attack Kate and the giant crocodile jumps out of the water on the second floor of the villains' headquarters and across the balcony and pulls out the bad Kate and instead of crashing directly through the building (and crush Kate) the Croc simply flies backwards with the same angle in the water. No law of physics can apply to this film or to special effects. At least there is honor among the crocodiles.
