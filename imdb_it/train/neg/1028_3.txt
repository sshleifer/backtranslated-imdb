I don't remember the last time I reacted to a performance as emotionally as I did to Justin Timberlake in "Edison". I was so emotional that I wanted to scream with anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the desperate cries of nihilism. Timberlake is horribly mixed; in fact, hitting him is like having Andy Dick play the lead role in "Patton" or Nathan Lane in the role of Jesus. But this is almost out of the question. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is simply a bad actor and would be equally terrible in any role. I had problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish looks and emotional expressions that derive from something like "The 25 Cliche Expressions for Actors", poisons the screen on which it is inflicted without mercy, and regardless of how it is affected I will not buy his role as an amateur journalist who has become a crusader for justice. It just won't fly. <br /> <br /> However, Timberlake alone is not the cause of its failure. Director David J. Burke places him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also puts him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was just as good) LL Cool J Can imagine an almost physically suffering one watching some of this cast interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> Obviously there is a positive side: the moment one of these actors interacts without Justin there seems a double relief. A pleasure, if you want. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but those ten minutes are happy in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br /> But Timberlake's shots are enough - words are not enough in this particular case to do the trick. "Edison" is a very, very rough story of corruption. The plot goes from the clich√© to the simple absurd. However, I admire the motivation behind the creation, which I interpret as a tribute to films like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco", or perhaps even "Chinatown". Don't get me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same field as these films, but I can extend my suspension of disbelief to admire his reason for existing, perhaps to justify my sitting through it. <br /> <br /> The script itself is surprisingly bad. Yes, he has decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (who is wasted here) and Timberlake seems to have been raised directly by an episode of Dawson's Creek. It is your typical dialogue of too-for-reality-to-say-impression-the-public-with-how-well-articulate (and failing). This dialogue, you think, is punctuated by great music at the wrong times - sometimes it seems that "Edison" wants to turn into a music video, where the excitement of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through badly chosen music and speed variations of the film (slow motion laws). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. He is sure he had a cast to kill, but the performances are ruined by Timberlake who simply doesn't work. In the film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels out. Directors must make difficult choices. David J. Burke missed the target here. Some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but overall, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces of different puzzles confined to a single incoherent picture. And it's not a particularly interesting puzzle to begin with.
