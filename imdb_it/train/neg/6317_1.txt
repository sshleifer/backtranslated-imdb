I have no idea which idiot from San Francisco invented this stupid plot, but apparently they need to drive away any drugs they take and put their analyst in danger - NOW. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a plausible story, if we consider the alien abduction sequence in "Life of Brian" plausible. <br /> <br /> This film is little more than a left pipedream. If the United States and the Soviet Union abandoned nuclear weapons, the result would have been to eliminate the only real obstacle that prevented the two from engaging in a war. As bad as Korea, Vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were "proxy wars" fought to keep the super powers from a direct commitment. <br /> <br /> This film makes me think of how realistic it was when a group of high school children would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone said "Mr. President, some children of Drastic High are not eating!" and Ronald Reagan would have replied "My God! I'd better review my defense policy!" Quite right. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? It would not be better if the Soviet Union collapsed because they could not support their massive construction of weapons ... wait, it happened!
