I didn't expect much, but I was disappointed. This was my least welcome Halestorm production I've ever seen. I thought it was a comedy, but I only giggled at 3 or 4 bars. Is it really a fun gag to see a fat man eating donuts and falling to the ground again and again? What combined the scene of the janitor in paradise? Fred Willard was hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but this didn't work. They must have spent the whole budget to make "known" actors appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It looks like it was shot with a video camera and many scenes were very dark. Do you really need a lot of film to show someone who actually shoots and makes a basket instead of cutting away and modifying a ball that moves through a basket? I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something fun, go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie.
