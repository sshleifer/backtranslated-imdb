When my son is begging me to leave the opening show of this movie, I know it's bad. I wanted to take my eyes off. I wanted to reach the screen and slap Mike Myers for sacrificing the last bit of dignity he had. This is one of the few films of my life that I have seen and I immediately wanted to "unwatch" if only it were possible. The other films are "Troll 2" and "Fast and Furious", both of which are better than this shit in the hat. <br /> <br /> I could drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget that I had ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good name of Seuss. <br /> <br /> To Mike Myers, I say stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. Just because it worked for Jim Carrey, doesn't mean that Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
