Ouch! This was a little painful to sit on. It has a nice and funny premise, but from there everything goes to hell. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville have performed surprisingly decent shows. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly, among others, have exaggerated. I know this is the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame the actors, when the script and the director make them make such a lock. If you have outrageous characters, that's fine, but you have to have good material to make it work. It wasn't here. Run away screaming from this movie if possible.
