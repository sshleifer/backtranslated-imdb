Absolutely predictable silly show about a man who killed his wife by cutting her while driving and said he was unconscious. Why was he still driving a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car after killing his wife with one? This question did not occur to writers. The story then gets dark about a psychologist and her failed marriage, which is linked to the failure of a blackout driver's marriage to kill his wife. An omniscient mother and a one-dimensional child are thrown for good measure, and everything accumulates in a predictable and overwhelming end. Are police psychologists so easily involved? Wrong writing that the actors do their best, but they are doomed to failure. This is on par with a Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time looking at this unless it's what you're aiming for.
