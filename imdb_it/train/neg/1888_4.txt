This film reminds me of "Irr√©versible (2002)", another art film with a violent and radical approach to human nature. I didn't like the movie, but I can't say it's a bad movie, it's just special. It also reminds me of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a group of low-class characters reside in a beach camp in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their will and with all the clash of characters that do not fit together. I also thought of the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I didn't like the movie and I don't like people in it either. They all look so vulgar, without any good basic taste. The question could be asked why they live, they all seem to be on this planet a member of a great farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: hell is on this world.
