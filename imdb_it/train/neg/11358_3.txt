When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised. In May 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was shown in a 4-D attraction (you know, the attraction that places move). I imagine the version I saw was a shortened version (15 min.) And also recreated to add motion effects. It was a nice film ... but it was so. It was educational and told of the first mission, but the end of a spacewalk in CGI seemed a little ... well ... trivial. I wasn't a big fan of the film, but I would recommend this film to all parents who want to inform their children in a fun way on the first moonwalk. I must say that the actors of the character were well selected and that the characters themselves were nice. So all in all, I'd say, if you want to take the younger kids ... take it. But if you want to bring your older children, bring them to another movie ... they'll thank you.
