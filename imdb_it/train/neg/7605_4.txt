I imagine that "Gunslinger" is not as terrible as most of the movies that "Mystery Science Theater 3000" shows, but westerns are not Roger Corman's forte. Portraying Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) as sheriff in an Old West town after the sheriff's husband was murdered and had to fight the bad guys, the film is pretty predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new hubby, who secretly works for the unctuous Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). Corman's co-star Dick Miller also appears briefly as a postman (Miller nowadays plays in Joe Dante's films). I want to say that you'll probably want to see the "MST3K" version to really enjoy this movie. They had a great time with this.
