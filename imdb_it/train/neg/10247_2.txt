This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, it's horrible. Christopher Lee is good but does not fit, the only positive thing is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title. "End of the World" is really a bad movie, I stopped seeing it near the end it was so bad, just for the fans of hard movies that have brains to put up with this vomit.
