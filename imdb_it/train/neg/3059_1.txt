Well, I recently had the chance to rent this and see Santa Claus win over the marquises. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I should have said that Santa was a much worse film. As a Spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we're all talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone was amazed and wondered what the evil Mr. Pitch would do. Merlin would help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it's the biggest piece of trash I've ever seen and I love it for that. : D
