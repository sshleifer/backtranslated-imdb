Director Ron Atkins is credibly crazy. This very low budget film tells the story of a few days in the life of a Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also wrote in collaboration), a madman who receives a Rubberneck doll from his bitch's girlfriend. Start taking orders from the doll to take huge amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What begins as a movie of exploiting the balls on the wall remains well, but it becomes VERY repetitive VERY fast. I am leaning more towards the ceremonious fool. It is difficult to forget once seen however. A bit like if Tom Green had ever made a horror movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell becomes completely naked; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush <br /> <br /> Candy ANTI-eye: see John completely naked repeatedly
