It was not pleasant to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal job (boring!) Only then can his stepson go to film school, but his stepson decides he will make a humiliating documentary on man. A documentary director should point the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with sneaky captions. The director's bitterness and resentment towards his stepfather is obvious. Is sad. The goal seems to be to make Frank look stupid and pathetic, instead he runs into the most human character of the 3 people present. <br /> <br /> Essentially a smear campaign dressed as something much smarter and more edgy than it really is. He left me an intense aversion to the director.
