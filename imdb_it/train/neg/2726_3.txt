Considering his pedigree, this should be a much more pleasant film than it is. Even with a collection of eccentrics that makes the lips snap in the cast - which aficionado would not wait impatiently for a film bringing together Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is rhythmic, sadly filmed and, most of the time, without spirit. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comical, as confirmed in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a good comedian, as he skilfully demonstrated in films, from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think it comes out better from this mess than from anyone else. Except maybe the cat.
