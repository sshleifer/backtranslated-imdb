This guy has no idea about cinema. Okay, it looks like he made some interesting stage shows in his youth, and that two acceptable films that have been more successful than political reasons have led to fooling communist censorship. All this is very good, but look carefully: DO NOT KNOW YOUR WORK! The scenes are unbalanced, without a correct start and, with a disorderly content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he quits with violence, nudity and bad language. How is it possible to keep a rotten corpse alive that has never understood anything about the profession and the art of cinema? Why don't they let him succumb to a piece?
