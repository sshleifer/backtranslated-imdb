Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children's story, La Bete (1975) aka The Beast tries to imagine (in a very graphic way and what may seem offensive and disturbing but actually rather silly and comic), what is actually happened between Beauty and the beast? I am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deep in this film. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and obscure exploration of subjects such as sexual frustration, desire, fulfillment or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I wouldn't even call it an erotic-erotic film. It is more than a parody of all genres that touches or mentions even if it has shocking moments in all the departments that will surely remain in the memory. <br /> <br /> The long (too long) scene between a young aristocrat woman and the presumably horrible but the most laughable I've ever seen in a cinematic creature with a real ... anatomy, is set on harpsichord music of Scarlatti and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the meeting. The moral of the scene is: beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is: who is the target audience for the film? For an erotic image, it is too wordy; for an art film - there are too many stunning scenes of sheer madness and I would say an abrupt ending. IMO, the creator of the film did not mean that it was a serious drama. As a parody of the art / horror / erotic house, it's fun and certainly original. Take a good laugh and try not to look for a deep meaning. This story of curious beauties and lustful beasts is certainly not recommended for co-vision with children. The opening scene that can surprise an unprepared observer much more than the infamous bestiality scene can be successfully used on the Discovery channel for the program as "In the animal world - mating habits and horse rituals".
