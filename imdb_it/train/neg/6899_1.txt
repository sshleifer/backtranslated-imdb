Have you ever wondered why the inhabitants of the Pacific islands seem to automatically assume the sense of humor of black Americans? regardless of their ethnic origins? Well, this film will not provide any answer to this question, often considered, but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning this film serves as a sort of "Old School" for New Zealanders on the Pacific island, which immediately raises the question of exactly what the point of this task is. Will it perpetuate the entrenched stereotypes of New Zealanders on the Pacific island? or is it intended to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes without humor and the ending is expected. This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema, as it is simply an appropriate romantic comedy, devoid of any value.
