May contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> I say this, but anyone who is experienced enough to read this can probably understand every storyline from the beginning. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that I liked. I didn't hate him in the way of some films that insult your intelligence, but everything seemed too predictable on his way to the required happy ending. There were fun pieces along the way to be sure, but few were original. At least he didn't go for the gutter. <br /> <br /> Christina Applegate looks fresh, and Ben Affleck works hard. Their scenes together are actually the only saving feature. All the others are a cardboard cutout, including, surprisingly, James Gandolfini, who must have done it as a favor to someone. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a harmless, but not stimulating, 90 minutes.
