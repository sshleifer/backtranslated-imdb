<br /> <br /> Ok, I rented this film while I was in bed, jumped on a painkiller, and let me say that it didn't help the film. <br /> <br /> The film is about a man who buys a car as he goes through a mid-life crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there was something to ruin) I will let your imagination follow the "Zany buffs" (and I use this word lightly) that follow. <br /> <br /> fight to stay awake through this snoring a minute of sleep in a movie, and I'd like to say that if you're venturing into the cinema and thinking you're adventurous, please don't do it, it's a waste of the movie has been printed on. <br /> <br /> So I could be wrong ...
