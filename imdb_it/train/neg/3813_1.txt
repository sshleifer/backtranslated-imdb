What a crime ... <br /> <br /> You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's do a 30-minute show about it and have a couple of kids make noise and then invite dad to give them a lesson because it is what to do. <br /> <br /> But don't forget that Uncle Joey has to make strange noises and cooked faces, then Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and jeans and look nice for a few minutes while everyone is arguing of how mom would have done things if she was around .. <br /> <br /> Yes, full of irreverent little adventures on a lot of nothing and a whole story too long to build around it. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only bore you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
