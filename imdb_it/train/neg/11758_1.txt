I saw this film with low expectations and I was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's actually fun in a very nice way. <br /> <br /> Gael is absolutely terrible, I mean he can't act, period. He should give up now, since acting clearly isn't his thing .. His co-stars have more or less the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy. <br /> <br /> I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad that I felt compelled to do it. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch this movie, don't do 0/10 if there was a 0
