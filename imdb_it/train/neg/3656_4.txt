I have to admit that I've been a sucker for Samurai films since I can remember. I looked rather indiscriminately, whether it be "elitist" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked American / Japanese "Crossovers" like The Bushido Blade. And of course everything that contains Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've practically seen every samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> In 1993 I saw Kabuto on video for the first time, that even Samurai movies can be boring. At first I couldn't wait for Mayeda to reach Europe and the clashes that would have resulted, but by the time it actually reached Spain, I didn't care much for the film anymore. <br /> <br /> I would not do the film by calling it "bad". Technically it is a clean entry in the genre. But it is simply never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills both as a director and as an actor and has only a part of the charisma of the Japanese actors mentioned above. And speaking of Sho Kosugis's son, Kane, who appears in almost all Sho Kosugi's films as Shos's son: he inherited as a child to any of his fathers limited acting abilities. The addition to the negative points is the absence of blood and blood which until then was a trademark of all Samurai films. This was obviously intended for a younger American / European audience. Let's just say it's a movie like this for action adventure adventure fans, but boring for the hardcore Samurai movie fans. Fans participating in the "Samurai meets ??" genre should rather go see Red Sun (1971), with Charles Bronson as a cowboy who must work with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from the villain Alan Delon. It's practically like doing it the right way and where Kabuto was wrong. <br /> <br /> So even if the film is only 100 minutes long, it looks like a much longer film. <br /> <br /> The reason I gave this 4/10 honorable points instead of 3/10: the first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the synchronized German version. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I must admit that his "Engrish" is sometimes funny but it gets boring after about 30 minutes.
