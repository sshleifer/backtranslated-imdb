This film was a critical and box-office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that was later turned into a play, which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some naval officers on leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have 4 days of vacation spent at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film runs a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a sort of wheel salesman and he really doesn't. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially destined to act alongside Grant, but had other commitments - so did Suzy Parker. He had never acted before, but at the time he was the best American photographic model. I think he did a good job, considering all the pressure he was under. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few short scenes - it didn't really work. The Studio was trying to give her some class by starring with Grant - but the character had no substance.
