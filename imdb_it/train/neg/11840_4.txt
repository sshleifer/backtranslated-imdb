Everything that could be potentially interesting in this material sank in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we are about to see can never be known and "This is the whisper [the voice] most often told" about one of the "mysteries" most sensational in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Ok. So we're not getting anything new (and E! "Mysteries & Scandals" gives you a better grip on the particular incident ... and that's not much of an approval). What do we get? <br /> <br /> We discover that Hollywood is a nest of vipers and decadents. There are no big news there. More interesting we learn what a washed director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and / or in the political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is talking about his own experience through these characters. But what is being said is so cynical, ugly and confused, that we feel guilty for having witnessed a pile of melody that passes off as history. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film has a curious crazy quality that I found more irritating than funny. We are not empathetic with anyone. And the great "Citizen Kane" clarifies the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In "The Cat's Meow" we are never sure of Davies' reasons for being with Hearst. As soon as we are told one thing, she does not do the other. <br /> <br /> And should we believe that Davies was Chaplain's love of life? Or he's just trying to steal one of the most powerful - and apparently more moral citizens of America. The film never makes clear. <br /> <br /> What is convincing is the production values. There is a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the jackets on men's jackets than following a story that defames many of the most famous personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the script is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film make everything even more uncertain and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Musicians cannot be criticized, even if Meg Tilly goes far beyond parody. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. It gives the most sincere performance in a sea of ​​chewing landscapes. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but to the point that it seems to move away from the whole enterprise rather than tell it. One of his first lines is "I'm not here!" And I'm sure he would like it not to be. <br /> <br /> It is not on par with Bogdanovich, unkempt, so bad that it is good, "At Long Last Love". He is perched on the attempt of something serious, but hesitates and stumbles mainly because he is so full of bitterness towards "the beast" named Hollywood. This is the movie "National Enquirer". And not only does it dirty the names of those who the film puts on board the Oneida that weekend, but the public also becomes rather dirty.
