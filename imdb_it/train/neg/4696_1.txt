I know people and I did some animation and graphic design and the show is horrible! They are rich kids who have no talent and probably have pleaded with Nick to accept them! Alex played drums for a year, I played for 4 1/2! The film is terrible, as is the show! This is the craziest and most mixed comedy that has ever been fun I've ever seen. It's so stupid to make me want to shell out !!! It's so crazy that Nickelodeon would never accept such a thing and so stupid! They are so stupid and weird! I hate their show and I think that once Nick realizes how stupid he is, I hope they go out!
