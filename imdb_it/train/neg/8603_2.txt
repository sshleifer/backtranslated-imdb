This may have been a pretty funny movie, but instead it features other scenes like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the film food chain. If they had played this joking film, it could have been a very funny film, like Re-Animator or Dead ALive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays it ironically at times but straight more often. <br /> <br /> The premise of this film is a small community besieged by mutant snails. There is a toxic waste dump abandoned near a sewer line that changes snails into aggressive monsters that eat meat - even if the monsters move slowly and can be crushed under your boot. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people who seem willing to fight snails while the sheriff and the mayor think they're crazy. The climax is a riot of laughter - involuntary to this - that makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and scriptwriters) the scenario of destruction of snails is. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (No new ground Simon seems to interpret the gore elements in an ironic way but the dialogue is linear, if Simon had worked with a clever script - one with lots of jokes and eccentric characters, this may have been a cult film). <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $$$ (You will not be disappointed here. There are a lot of bursts of chest cavity scenes and a head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. which many movie watchers horror have fun, is in full swing here. Also keep the corpses of people that have been chosen clean by snails and a lot of overwhelming scenes). <br /> <br /> ATTACK: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and offers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how absurd this film is the purpose. Kim Terry, like his wife, he does an adequate job even if he does little beyond the cry of holding-the-face-while-you-yell "the teenagers" were all horrible actors - without exception Friend, this movie could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers become bad in bed before being sent - in a badly done scene - by a horde of snails that crawled into the bedroom of the girl, here both male and female nudity).
