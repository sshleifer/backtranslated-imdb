Being a fan of bad taste horror movies, I saw it in my video library and thought I'd give it a try. Now that I've seen it, I don't want a living soul on the planet. I get my movie rentals for free, and I feel it was not worth paying my money. I've seen some bad horror movies in my time, hell I'm a fan of them, but this was just an insult.
