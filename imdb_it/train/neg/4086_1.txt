I came to this film with great expectations. I was aware of Greenaway's work and "The Tempest" and was interested in an adaptation. First I wanted to switch off after ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. There was a representation of a storm, but where in your mind do you conceive a little boy peeing on a toy boat? Is it symbolic of what? I continued for another ten minutes with the finger twitching on the "off" button, something caught my interest somewhere. This is not Shakespeare, it is not cinema. There is a time and a place for this, but I will not waste time and there is no place for this in my Shakespeare studies. I gave up after twenty-five minutes and that was the end. Then I read all the comments on this site and the film's pretentiousness is matched by its defendants. 'It's a painting ... then I put it in a gallery', 'it's a ballet ..... keep it on stage then'. Shakespeare can be done intelligently, and the representations were performed for a mass audience, were accessible, and this version helps put a wedge between Shakespeare and the general population in general - and I don't think the Bard would be happy with that .
