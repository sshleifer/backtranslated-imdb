This is the story of two boys who found a copy of "Funky Monkey". It seemed strange to find this when I realized that there are still posters for the film in the Cineplex Odeon club. After seeing classics like "Every Which Way But Loose" and "Project X", these two guys imagined that the monkeys movies are fantastic. <br /> <br /> These guys had a long ride watching this movie. There was a monkey that was replaced by a MAN Stunt when action sequences were required. It was evident that the monkey had not been trained in Shakespearean drama school. Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck may have helped the boys think. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a strong helper could help like a Jackie Chan or perhaps even Hulk Hogan. Fortunately this film had a fantastic martial artist and Jet Li as Matthew Modine. While some may argue that Matthew Modine doesn't come close to Jet Li, the camera's tricks show that it's just as good. When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimpanzee is unable to handle the film, the film relies on Matthew Modine to be the real star. <br /> <br /> Did I mention that there is a lousy boy who develops a bond with Modine and the monkey? Is there a possibility that the child will learn trust and even collect a girl in this film? Even Matthew Modine should be jealous of this (because using the shooting line "I'm a monkey's second violin" doesn't seem to work with women). <br /> <br /> Shortly after seeing this movie, the two boys received a call from Matthew Modine telling them "Seven days".
