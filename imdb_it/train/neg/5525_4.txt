The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to watch them. And those that are watched tend to be sensationalized and to current or current problems or problems in the news (or recent news). Films that explain or explore the human condition are not popular. Particularly with the crowd of young people that would be the Miss Lohan fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make films not simply popular but financially successful for their studies. <br /> <br /> The specific problems I had with this film are the liking of some of the characterizations. It was a little blaming all the acting of Lohan's character (destroying the car, using drugs, etc.) on what his stepfather did to her. Although not unlikely, it is just a little too much to expect the public to swallow. Also, other aspects, like her giving Morman's young boyfriend, oral sex, or that she would actually be a good assistant to the vet, who randomly has something for her mother, etc., all these elements didn't really do help this movie. He placed it more in the element of a comedy situation by trying one of their "special dramatic episodes", then it was done for a well-made and well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch the DVD and listen to the comment, especially for the various alternative endings, you can really see all this is very careful.
