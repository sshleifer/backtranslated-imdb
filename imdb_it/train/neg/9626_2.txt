Don't cut it up. There are many things wrong with this film. It's a cliché all along the way, not very funny, predictable and illogical. Let's start from the beginning: characters. There's the boring, unlucky boy - who gives Stiller another notch in his boring, lucky men's belt - the supposedly savage, but actually just quite normal, love interest - that Aniston plays well, but not he needed to do it - the fat, jovial friend, and then the assortment of clichés: an annoying Australian, a confident Spanish boy, etc. The plot: the beginning is a bit unusual, but from that moment on it goes to the standard style of any film, with every predictable twisted plot like your knock-knock line. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character really seemed to come from nowhere - like your average school play, the writers knew where it started and where it ended, but they didn't put enough items in the middle. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing more than highly watered down versions of normal gross humor; there was a regulatory chunder scene, fat sweaty men, etc. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the simple fact of this film is that learning the meaning of the word 'shart' was the only good thing. Hamburg really prepared a dinner for dogs here, and Stiller's and Aniston's sugary coating may have attracted the spectators, but the flavor left in the end was just as rancid. <br /> <br /> Final comment: This film could have been terrible, but Aniston chose a better film among the Friends of the Seasons rather than the hateful "Marci X" by Kudrow.
