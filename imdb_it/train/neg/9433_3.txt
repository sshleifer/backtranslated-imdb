I bought Unhinged because I was sucked into the bloody photo on the cover. If you want to see all the beautiful parts of the movie, look at the back of the box. All the kills are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the frames than they do in the movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, let's take a look at the plot. A group of college girls participating in a rock concert (through the deep and dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slip off the road. No visible damage was done to the machine, but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or perhaps he read the script and was already in a coma before filming began). <Br /> <br /> The two remaining girls wake up in a large isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and handles more drama only because of its presence than all the actors in the film. For some reason, however, this house has no roads that go to it. The only way to get to the main road is to take a five-mile hike through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting and listening to strange conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like George Washington in a drag) and her equally housewife and sexually repressed daughter. Apparently the girls were in no hurry to return from that concert, as they had put together more Gilligan's Island cast clothes for that three-hour tour. <br /> <br /> When we, the spectators, get to the killing scenes, we no longer care. We hope that someone will kill us just to end our suffering. Unhinged finally ends up with a pretty shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better movie. It's almost as if the final, the only good idea of ​​the film, was written first and then the writers tried to make a film that would bring it. <br /> <br /> Unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting, direction inetta, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porn movie (sorry, I'm not sure where it came from). You will have an idea of ​​how bad this film is during the opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering. Do not waste time. You will simply feel Unhinged and want your time and money back.
