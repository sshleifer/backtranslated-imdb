"Demons III: The Ogre" is unrelated to the pre-sequel of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 are cool 1980s classic horror". Demons III: The Ogre "is a very stupid, bored, cheap monster. To confuse the writer is" Demons III: The orc "(Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are writers of very poor quality and stupid that the boring ghost of William Shakespeare or the demon's egg from Spider's web or what Huhuhuhuhu makes the girl dream of. very very boring film. I bought the special DVD box called "Demons" in the 3 different movies called "Demons III: The orc" , "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" have no subtitles and subtitles cost $ 14.99 from the Best Buy store in the city of Downey because Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writers that make the stupid movie almost like "Halloween III "have no monsters of Michael Myer but people wear Halloween. I am very confused, I love" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 are better boring stupid "D emons III: The Ogre" is not part of "The Demons" and "The Demons 2" are the same demons. <br /> <br /> Thanks Juan Antonio De La Torre
