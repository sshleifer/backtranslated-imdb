John Goodman's program was pretty horrible, but this thing is simply bad. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has confused memories of rebellious childhood, but has never acquired any sense of perspective for adults in later years. Paranoia rules the dark world in which these characters live. All are unpleasant and without reason. The plot is predictable but the show staggers from an inexplicable scene, not connected to another so uselessly that you don't enjoy watching it. The worst thing is that nobody on the production team seems to have ever seen snow!
