Oh, this was a bad movie. The girl who plays Jennifer is OK, but I think she acts damn in the movie, not because she's having her organs ripped from a crow during the night, but because she's thinking of firing her agent for putting her in this piece of shit . Faye Dunaway behaves as if she were re-doing Mommy Dearest and the ending is completely silly. I absolutely cannot recommend this film, although as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I was a bit intrigued by references to his work (Ravens, House of Usher - like the curse of the family, and being buried alive) - until he he would probably turn in his grave if he knew about this movie.
