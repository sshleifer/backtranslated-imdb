This show is horrible. How does George want his mother's death to be fun? This show is terrible. Parents are obviously horrible and children should be taken to childcare. The daughter is a witch with a b and the son is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he talks about his noisy and nasty brand of Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I giggled him a couple of times, but above all how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible and despicable character. Sure, her husband left her, but as someone can laugh at the way he treated George like a child is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Can someone explain to me how funny George's head is? It's not even that big! I went by the characters because they are too horrible and it would take hours to write and, frankly, I don't care enough. I'm pretty interested in telling anyone who looks at this and asking them whether or not they want to watch this show, that this show is an abysmal excuse for a sitcom, and not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give you start 2, because the wife is extremely attractive.
