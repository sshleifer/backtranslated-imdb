I didn't really like this movie. The plot was very predictable. Typical American plot, I'm sorry. In the end the guy gets the kind of girl. And does London have a monorail? Bank of London ??? Bank of England is what it really is !! - I still liked the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And were the English bad? (except for Parker and Lady Penelope) What happened? Oh and they kept saying things like "Here as 'The Thunderbirds'" - but it was never known as "The Thunderbirds" in the series, why do it ?? I'd like to see this redone in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred the original series. Sorry!
