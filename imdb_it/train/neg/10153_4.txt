SLASHERS (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Not really a great movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look pretty good considering the small budget they had working with The film is apparently an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several competitors to a closed "danger zone" and has three costume insinuations sent after them to kill them. The survivor, if there is one, wins fame and fortune ... all the others end up dying. The main drawback to this film is that acting is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seem real at all. The actors playing the killers are a bit funny ... because they portray exaggerated and extravagant caricatures of modern and popular types of horror movies ... and that's exactly how they would be if this were a real show. The film pretends to be done all at once ... there is an operator who follows the competitors around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the point of view of his camera ... but the lights continue to flash . constantly (to hide the "cuts" from one take to the other, I guess).
