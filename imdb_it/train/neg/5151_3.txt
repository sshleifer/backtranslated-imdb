I thought it was a great idea, but boy, he was badly executed. We get a broad sense of how complex and demanding are backstage operations of a show, but practically no specification on any of these functions. The producers do not seem to have found a way to tell a story or give the viewer a "common thread". (Which does not mean that they have not tried, but the fact that the writers refer to a synopsis of the Ring cycle because the narration of the program has nothing to tell us about the work of editing a work physically). <br /> <br /> We see a lot of things happening, but we are told little about what people are doing and why. There is little sense of who is who, or how the various production departments adapt and work together. For example, we repeatedly hear of a problem of some kind: we therefore expect to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it is solved. But filmmakers generally limit themselves to doing something else (generally, general videos of people pushing stuff or talking in headphones). <br /> <br /> Overall the film ends up looking more like a pastiche of images than you see running under the credits of a show, rather than something worth looking at for its own merit.
