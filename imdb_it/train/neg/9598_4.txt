Robert Colomb has two full-time jobs. He is known worldwide as a globetrotter television journalist. His exploits as a full-time womanizer are less well known but equally demanding. <br /> <br /> I saw "Vivre pour Vivre" dubbed in English with the title "Live for Life". Some life! It seems that Robert always has at least three women in his life: a lady who is leaving, one who enters and his wife betrayed at home. Help Robert be a lying liar. Among his most useful lies are "I'll call you tomorrow" and "My job lasted longer than expected". He spends a lot of time and money on planes, trains and hotel rooms due to his succession of connections. You wonder when this guy will be caught with his pants down. <br /> <br /> Some might find his life exciting, but I thought it was boring. His companions, including his wife Catherine, are all attractive and desirable women. But his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceiving, you wonder if he is enjoying all this. <br /> <br /> Adding to tedium is a remarkable film that does not favor the plot. There are extended sections without dialogues or only French dialogues. We see documentaries of wars, torture and training of troops interspersed with live action. When Robert's flight returns from Africa, we wait and wait for the plane to land and take you by taxi to the airport terminal. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is the protagonist of this film. His was the most interesting character and interpreted him perfectly. It was also great to see Candice Bergen at the start of her career. I can't find fault with Yves Montand's exhibition of what was basically an amoral tramp. <br /> <br /> I liked some of Claude Lelouch's novel techniques. In a hotel room scene, the camera looks at the room while Robert and his mistress argue. We see them briefly during each passage around the room. In another scene set in a sleeping train carriage, Robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is down. Robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news, but we only hear some parts of it because of the train noise. I felt that his wife was not able to absorb every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also liked the exciting safari scenes in Africa. The cinematography of those scenes and those of Amsterdam was superb. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this film as part of a project at the Library of Congress. I called the FIFTY project: 50 notable films forgotten in 50 years. As I can best determine, this film, like the other forty-nine I identified, was not on video, broadcast live or distributed in the United States from its original version. In my opinion, it is worthy of being made available again. <br /> <br />
