Who's Bettie's page? I certainly didn't find out while watching this movie. From what I have gathered from other sources, Mrs. Page was in great demand in the post-World War II period as the queen of "bad" images and this is exactly what this film describes. I never knew Bettie, the woman, though. His childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an evangelical Christian education and a sordid domestic life that is only hinted at. The film hides his personal life and reaches the aim of the film, the "bad" images. The characters are introduced and abandoned in a few frames, but there is a frame after another of Bettie in her pointy bras, Bettie in her belt and stockings, Bettie in slavery ... etc. The film runs from black and white to color whenever Ms. Page visits Miami Beach. Then back to its shades of gray life in New York. Gretchen Mol plays Bettie as one of the stupidest girls you can ever meet. When Bettie confides in a friend who missed her high school high school getting an A rather than an A, she can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class. The most interesting part of this film is the way in which the "bad" photos of Ms. Page appear in 2007. It is really sad that seeing a woman tangled as a pig on a spit doesn't even have a hit on My Space or You Tube. I'm not sure this movie was badly written or if some crazy editorial cut it to shreds. I would recommend it only as a source for people studying the story of strange undergarments.
