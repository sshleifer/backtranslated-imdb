I Am Curious is actually two films in one - half is the experimental sexual side of Lena and the other half is her curiosity with the political / socialism. Whatever the director's intention is, the two don't really come together. The director should have limited himself to Lena's romantic side and made a separate film for politics. There is a bizarre mixture of political / war demonstrations, Dr. King, serious political interviews, floating breasts and pubic hair. The film looks more like an imaginary documentary than a film. In addition to interesting sex scenes, you will get bored watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I think nude / sex scenes are exaggerated for what it is. If you want to see the real porn, I'm sure there are better choices. The pervasive nudity is a great distraction from any plot there is. I think the cast did a great job anyway. They played their parts credibly. There is a bit of exaggeration that I am so used to seeing in American films during this period.
