Flat characters that you don't like and will never interest you. Inducing dialogues to places. No twist (they think they have one, but if you don't understand it after about 40 minutes you're not too bright). Many well-known actors in roles and shows who, fortunately for all those involved, will be forgotten as soon as the credits roll. <br /> <br /> I don't mind "slow" movies, but they have to go somewhere_. This is not. <br /> <br /> The plot was not what made this film direct on DVD, it is just a rather comfortable excuse to try to invent some false controversy. <br /> <br /> As-of-writing 37 votes (!) ten (10) must be attributed to the people involved in the production.
