I'm a big horror / splatter fan, I even like horror movies that some people consider stupid. I also like gore. The more we are, the better, as long as it has a point. <br /> <br /> After reading the reviews of others on the site I was sure that this film would be a little gem. But to my great disappointment it turned out to be one of the most useless films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, the dialogue was stupid, the plot was useless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for 2 years. I usually find that all these features make a great horror movie. But not in this case. <br /> <br /> I put 11 euros on my belt to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> Unless you really like the useless gore (for example the "violent sh * t" movies) avoid at all costs!
