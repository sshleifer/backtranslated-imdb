A gave him a "2" instead of a "1" (horrible) because there is no denying that many of the images were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. But this was not enough to save him. <br /> <br /> The toned, faded "sepia" genus of colors has been done many times before in other films. Nothing new there. I see there were a few tips on hats for other old classic movies. OK. No problem. <br /> <br /> But a film must be fun and interesting, not something that makes you sleep. <br /> <br /> The plot and the script of this film It was terrible, the characters are two-dimensional. Slow motion. Some scenes were beautiful to look at, but in the end, overall, it was pretty boring, I couldn't recommend it.
