"Pandemonium" is a parody of the horror film that becomes more stupid than funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy parody. "Airplane", the trilogy "The Naked Gun", "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that play a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up there with those films. Most of the scenes in this film made me sit there in dumbfounded silence because the movie wasn't all that funny. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you watch a play, you expect to laugh more than a couple of times and that's all this movie is doing. Geez, "Scream" had more laughter than this movie and that was more of a horror movie. How bizarre is it? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
