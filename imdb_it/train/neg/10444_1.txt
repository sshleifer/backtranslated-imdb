the only beautiful thing about the film is the title. In this case, "Snake On a Plane" is an example of not judging the book by its cover, the title says nothing about the film. When I went to the theater, I did not expect Citizen Kane, I expected Independence Day, a movie that is pure fun with popcorn, but instead, I received that horrible film by Roy Liotta entitled "Turbulence" Yes, that's how bad SOAP be it The only thing that makes SOAP better is its title. And it is not even the title appurted for the film, the was not even a taste of "snake" or "plane" 40 minutes in the film! What a false advertisement! If it were not for his title, SOAP would be just another cheap summer B-quality economic film. And the vote R? It must be the most undeserved R-free movie of all time! The film's creators add only a few words to make this an R, All violence is kept at the pg-13 level. Do you know what R really is worth? The R rated superstar Edge! Look at Summerslam instead of wasting your money on a snake!
