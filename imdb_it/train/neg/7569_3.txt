It certainly fits the period in which Axis & Allies played spy games across much of North Africa and the rest of the world. Not the best of the films, but certainly not the worst of budget films as described previously by the War Classics compilation. <br /> <br /> Duncan "Cisco Kid" Renaldo was very good at one of his first feature films. I really liked the performance of Harry Parke (credited as Parkyarkarkus). Because he never had bigger roles is beyond me. He played the role of perfect partner / partner and saved the film ... imho. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, this film was part of a Superbox-Mart budget package called War Classics. Eight films for eight dollars, which included other never heard films that have decent stars trying to pay their bills. <br /> <br /> This script is ... well, not so hot. Editing and cinematography are ... worse. If you can bypass all this and want to see the future Cisco Kid is a great assistant who unfortunately never realized his true potential, definitely take it back! Otherwise, there are other World War II films to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
