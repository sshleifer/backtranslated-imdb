I thought it wasn't the best re-cap episode I've ever seen (even though my viewing partner gave me a handkerchief in anticipation of Brendan Fraser ... * sigh *). It was good to see Cox out of the state incessantly "Coxism State" which is these days, even if only for short moments. I also liked trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youth of the first episodes. Can I also see how Zach could be on track for a Chevy Chase or is it Matthew Perry? chemical drop induced slide (already recognized on Conan). A small side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance editing was Martin Sexton's "Diner".
