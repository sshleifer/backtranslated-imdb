This film is not worth the film on which it was photographed. Dialogue is flat, filled with overused lines of clich√©s and delivered by amateur actors who sound like they are reading a script for the first time. The uncertain, unstable film style is an economic imitation of "The Ring" visual effects. The characters don't even behave like a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for his twin sister at his house makes his way through the front door, sneaks into the frightened and sobbing house and does not even once call his sister's name to see if he is home. What? You'd think he just buried his sister instead of looking for her. Too many flashbacks to his childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of an amateur director. In reality it is fun to watch the numerous shots of the woman driving her car along the road, on the driveway behind this corner, over there, oh a side view, now a front view. Enough already. You would think to watch a TV commercial for the Solaris! Terrible movie 0 out of 100. I really feel sorry for anyone who has spent money making this film or watching it.
