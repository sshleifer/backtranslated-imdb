All the ingredients of the cult cinema of the b-low-brow movie. Topless girls (and bottomless), kicking kung-fu chefs, slave traders, evil-whiskered Germans, Cameron Mitchell, and sword zombies. <br /> <br /> And, of course, Camille Keaton's breasts, the most well-known of which appears in the classic feminist exploit I Spit on Your Grave. We must also mention the fistfights of the Shepard jewel, who play a prostitute in the recent movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Much blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, in a brothel, and on a ship loaded with martial artists headed for some island of zombies where the bad artists martial go to die or something. <br /> <br /> Plans and bottoms can be detached easily and frequently, as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner. <br /> <br /> Then the disaster strikes when their boat is destroyed and lands on the island of zombies where the mas monks sacrifice the young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life. <br /> <br /> Just when you thought he had it all, there are piranhas in the water. Yum Yum A big fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> The right thing for your next zombie party.
