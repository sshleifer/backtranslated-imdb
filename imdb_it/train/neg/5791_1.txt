As a native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the worst movies with native content I've ever seen. I'd rather have a root canal than see this movie again. The use of stereotypes, non-creative attempts to use portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work have only been compounded by the unintelligent narrative line and poor screenplay. The writer and director showed the worst parts of a colonized approach in portraying native people and communities. If this person is a native, he needs to go home and apologize to everyone they know for being an apple and for internalized racism and the bad sense of humor they have developed. If this person is not a native, he needs to seriously re-examine their white privileges and ask if they are experiencing unexamined, unintended racism or if they are intentionally ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors of this film have had fun and at least been paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native films, check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... to name just a few.
