If you are looking for the true story of the first baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed - however, if you are looking for a reasonably elaborate bodice scarab with an artistic theme, you have discovered that you are a movie. <br /> <br /> This film is such a fundamentally inaccurate representation of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi that it almost made me cry. (Enter Artemisia's inaccuracies in Google and check out some of the factual and fictional articles.) From a purely technical point of view, the film was fine: the sets, costumes and above all chiaroscuro lighting helped create an immersive at the beginning of the 17th century experience; even if the aforementioned GLARING FACTUAL INACCURIALITIES make it go down a bit. <br /> <br /> I wonder how the director / co-author Agn√®s Merlet defended his film at the time? Perhaps she refused to portray Artemisia as a victim, which would have been unfortunate, because let him face it, it was.
