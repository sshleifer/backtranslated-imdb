The music that grinds the nerves like nails on a blackboard, the acting that is so zombiélé it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second film; throw everyone into it like real zombies --- with the cast of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as the heroes ... a film so terribly terrible that if the "stoners" were still around it could be considered a cult movie --- but , oh so amateurish, the scripts could also be carried around by the actors, their lines read as they slowly dragged themselves through the film --- trivial and illogical sets modeled on the subdivisions of LA, props directly from ToysRus! Has a film ever been made so totally and totally inept ??? The logic flies to the wind in this tiring, senseless, useless and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that it fails to capture a turtle in an icebox --- lowcut, leggy --- and amazon! He kept my attention to the end; the way a terrible chain crash in the fog involving multiple vehicles continues to look to the end ... like, after a ridiculous beam fight in a prison on another planet, a sexy and mentally unbalanced, disadvantaged bounty hunter from the pneumatics chases a retarded extraterrestrial fugitive --- TO THE LAND! Don't let anyone stick it on your popcorn, you might really enjoy watching this. It's so bad!
