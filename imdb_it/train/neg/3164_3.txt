The hateful Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her from behind a truck and kills her. So he tries to ruin his ex-boyfriend's relationship with his new girlfriend, a psychic who can see her. <br /> <br /> Obvious non-original film would not be bad in a way of clich√©s, except that The character of Longoria is hateful and hateful that she dries up all the fun of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be honest, Longoria, and no one else in the cast or crew, is not the problem, it's the script of a terrible god that sinks the proceedings. It's really really stupid.
