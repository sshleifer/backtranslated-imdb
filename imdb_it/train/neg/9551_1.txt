This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "movie" "War Games- The Dead Code" was shot 2) Look at the original WAR GAMES with my current Knowledge of the computer And the eyes of a priest in 1983. 3) break into the computer of the pentagon in the 80s with the knowledge and perspective learned and remembered. 4) Reprogram the WHOPPER for NUKE the position of THE DEAD CODE minutes before its first day of shooting 5) Go back to the present, grab a beer and bring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "flash" my empty memory of the whole event , especially my original vision of "The Dead Code" 6) Have another beer and watch WARS GAMES 7) Be happy until the next bad remake of a GOOD 80's movie. <br /> <br /> 8) I forgot you killed Jar Jar. I'm not sure I have to travel to the future for this. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
