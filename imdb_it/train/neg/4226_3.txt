Wow ... I can't believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM is (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). I had heard the voices, read the reviews, but I had to think of myself. Well, let me tell you - HIT !!! The worst acting of every film ever made, the dubbing that had to be done while all the actors involved were completely wasted, inept and laughable FX gore, no recognizable plot, "cinematography" that looks like my grandmother filming it with the video camera, props which are no joke - made of metal foil - the list could go on and on ... <br /> <br /> Three boys run aground on an island where a group of strangers wanders with plastic swords and foil. Two of the prisoners are freed along with a rebel of the island's freaks, and a one-day advantage is given before being hunted by the rest of the "tribe" ... that's pretty much everything ... <br /> <br / > Honestly - this is one of the THE WORST films I have ever had the misfortune to submit to myself. The budget was supposed to be around $ 200 and was spent entirely on Gore FX (which may not have been a bad idea ...). There is NOTHING in ZOMBIE DOOM except for ridiculous looking gore scenes along with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialogues. This film makes other releases without budget as PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD looks like TITANIC. Some may classify ZD in the "so bad-is-good" category - and I think if you are REALLY drunk or tall and look at it with some MST3K-style friends - I guess it could be looked at that way. But not from me. I hated pretty much everything about it. Whether ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally scary and included as a "bonus" on the release of ZD's Shock-O-Rama) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas's other works - so it should be forbidden to always have something to do with the making of a film increasingly under penalty of death. There's a fun kung-fu battle in the second half of the movie, and a lot of blood - so I'll give this a generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.
