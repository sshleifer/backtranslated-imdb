I'd rather have 20 root channels than go through this movie again. The annoying prince, Myles Berkowitz, has wasted almost two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-fig. The only funny thing about this whole mess is Mr. Samaha's hateful teaser on tits and ass. Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it in the dust. He is moved and ill-made, in an apparent effort to make him look edgy or funny. It is neither rarely I feel that a film was a waste of film (or tape), but this qualifies for that distinction. If a date suggests seeing this movie, run.
