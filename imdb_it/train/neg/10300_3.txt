I'm a fan of artistic films, but unfortunately I have to report this film to be presumptuous. Agonizing slowly to develop a non-existent plot based on a promising premise, experience is, we could say, try. Even after the bad movies, I feel that I learn something, or that I liked some aspects, but there was nothing to appreciate. The premise was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends there. The acting was OK, although the characters were absolutely boring. For the protagonist to aim at such a daring goal, she is powerfully empty. Pity. I usually like films that are informative, but the lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
