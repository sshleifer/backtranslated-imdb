This was really terrible! He had a terrible plot, he was misinterpreted, and it was like an amateur remake of evil deaths, but not as good. <br /> <br /> It took all my tenacity to overcome this, it's a good job I didn't have to visit the bathroom otherwise I doubt I would come back! This makes Hammer House of Horror similar to a great Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The only value of this film was the endless supply of beautiful women. Not bad among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to quarrel with your friends after a night on the beer, then this is for you ... otherwise avoid it like the plague!
