Wow, what a total disappointment! The fact that people think this movie is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of "The ring". History? Was there one? Not in my opinion ... just a bunch of flashy images. The whole film was a boring, stupid disaster. I imagine there is always a market for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror movie I've seen in years. And that Buffy girl? Well, she's a bad actress! Plastic like Barbie and equally talented ... No, wait, it would be an insult to Barbie's talents! I suppose that many children helped this film at the box office because it was PG-13, and if it had been classified R, it would have bombed IMO! Stupid movie!
