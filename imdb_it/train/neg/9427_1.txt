When I rented "Unhinged", I was expecting a gore movie. The box also claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violence that were cut by the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts about its release in the theater). After finishing the film, I wondered how he could also receive a video. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: A group of three young women on a car trip crashes their car into a tree. These women somehow manage to make their way into a villa, which contains an extremely sexist woman. Beyond this point, the film is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the film long enough for release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie horrible is acting. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, looks like she's reading her lines on the cues. The other acting are bad, but not as bad as his. Another thing that makes this film negative is the camera technique. Many shots are taken by cameras fixed to the ceiling. This becomes very annoying as the film progresses. Besides all this, there is very little blood, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this. My vote: 1 out of 10
