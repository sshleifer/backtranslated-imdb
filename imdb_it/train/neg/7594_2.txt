Given the history of the director of this film, it's hard to believe that it was such a painfully bad film to deal with. I went to the European premiere last night and one of the executive producers was there. He still had to see the movie and, boy, it was a surprise. I have not read the book on which this is based, nor do I know if it is much appreciated or appreciated, but I read "Captain Correlli's mandolin" and saw how badly it was adapted for the screen and how bad this film was, I can assume just something like this happened here. The acting was not bad, even though there were a couple of too many raised Farrell eyebrows. Honestly, I can't believe how little I cared for a character in this movie. Situations appear on the screen in an empty sequence of nothing. The part of Donald Sutherland includes some scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I wasn't joking about the on-screen dialogue. I never walked on a movie, but I was tempted to start during this movie. I gave this film a score of "2" for reasons that seem horribly superficial, but these are the best things I can say about this movie. The first is that I liked the earthquake scene too short and the second is that Salma Hayek remained naked and looked beautiful. I can say little else about this film. Don't ask anything for dust, can't talk!
