First of all yes, I'm white, so I try to lightly trample the always delicate subject of the race ... anyway ... whites who hate blacks = bad but blacks who hate whites whites = ok (because of how much it seems we deserved it !! where do I start? I would like to have something good to say about this film apart from the unintended scenes of the comedy: the infamous scene was Ice Cube and co. fight with really big, really strong, really angry and scary neo-Nazis and win !!! the neo-Nazi where double the size :) and the pursuit! the chase is priceless ... it is NOT a film about race, tolerance and understanding, it does not lead ... this is a racist film that reaffirms all clich√© stereotypes, the white and lousy guy who is abused by his Black roommate automatically turns into a skinhead ... so it's just horrible, I'm sorry I never saw him. <br /> <br /> Save your time and the terrible experience of a portrait badly written, battered, boring and clearly distorted, if you are interested in the subject, go to Rent American History X, now it's a movie
