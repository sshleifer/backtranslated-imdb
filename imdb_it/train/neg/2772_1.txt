Warning spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, he was almost there. This was a bad movie, about a real story so interesting. He had such a promise, but the acting was ridiculous at best. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. The others are something out of a theme park. I found myself laughing as I watched, what must have been, serious scenes. I really wanted this movie a lot, but I couldn't. The best part was the fight between friends that ended with the "King" who is dying. I liked the punishment of Queens. And, the final shot took a nice picture, though. There are so many better movies to watch. I don't recommend it.
