This film was an absolute torture. First of all, it lasts 4 hours! True, Kargil's war may have had several points that were captured and fought, but every single one of those battles must not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised. Certainly it didn't seem, given that not enough basic information had been provided and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were performed so badly. I'm terribly disappointed by the man who gave well-made sequences in Border. Each battle was the same as the previous one. It was so predictable. (This could be a spoiler.) The entire army marches uphill, about five soldiers curse five thousand times each (they always use the same cussword each time), one of the main actors is hit, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says "No, don't take a stretcher, it would take 6 men from the battalion", and then an actor dies. That same identical thing happens again and again and again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the film is too big for his sake. Despite such a long film, none of the characters was well developed. The actresses had the most minuscule roles. They are all dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were crying out of sync. He was so funny. They moved their hands and their heads at the same time and then bit their dupatta together. <br /> <br /> The list continues unabated. I know I'm still forgetting something. Anyway, I think I hit the movie enough to get the picture.
