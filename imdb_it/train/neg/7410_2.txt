I love horror movies that bring out a lot of mystery like saying "silent hill" (which I found to be pretty good, but still, I was missing something) and movies that make you guess, I thought this was one of those movies. At the beginning the film starts with a certain suspense and creates a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it rolls down the hill and from there it goes faster and faster. At first I mentioned the silent hill because I can see many "stolen" themes from that movie in here. All in all I would say, look at the silent hill instead of this one, it's better, it's scarier, it has a lot more suspense and even the ending is much better .. And above all, you won't feel screwed like I did with this .. This seems to be one of those "I like that movie so I'm going to do it again in my really bad version" a movie ... Oh and another thing ... Lordi ... in a horror movie ... it's like trying to scare a baby with a bear that takes care of me and I will love you forever "written on the belly of it ..
