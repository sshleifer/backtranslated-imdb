Lorne Michaels proves once again that he has absolutely nothing to do by producing films. <br /> <br /> Would you think that after these dramatic films "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads", he would start to have the idea that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies ( and many say he does not know what he is doing when it comes to television, as well). Trying to make films with the sketches that brought their welcome the third time they were made on SNL makes no sense. <br /> <br /> I personally like Tim Meadows and I think it would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see a talented guy wasted on a movie that presents a funny and unpleasant situation, and closes everything with a terribly bad song and dance scene. Any laughter here will be because the film is so ugly, not because it's fun. <br /> <br /> Oh well, at least we can be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who have never made films about them. It's just a pity that this came to the big screen.
