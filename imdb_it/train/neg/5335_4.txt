It's been a fun time since I saw this play, and I had forgotten how idiotic it was. I would easily place him in the two or three lower ones of Elvis Presley's worst films. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, an Indian half-breed bull who returns home to Arizona and to the ruined shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandfather is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offers anything of substance, comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's cattle, but a bull is missing. Elvis can only sing some absolutely useless songs, and is chased by a crazy young girl and her mother armed with guns. This is just a real disaster, and the ruined environment practically smells like manure and doesn't make this much easier. The only thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis seems to really enjoy himself in the film. Hard to believe, considering he was so upset about being stuck doing so many mediocre films.
