I've seen a lot of sci-fi movies for original films since I started watching them in 2002 (my first was Sabretooth - which in my opinion is one of the funniest features of the Sci-Fi channel). Their quality varies. Some of them are mediocre but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculous and then there are some that are really terrible. Raptor Planet is in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to the Sci-Fi Channel's 2004 Original Raptor Island, is a barely manageable mess of a movie with truly horrible acting and a lazy script. The effects that give life to the dinosaurs (a combination of puppets and animatronics, as well as CGI and Raptor Planet repertoire material) are some of the worst effects I've seen in a low-budget film. The effects of blood are not even convincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a commando group that for some reason (I forget the reason) travel on a planet of alien dinosaurs. It's just people, dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in space. What are the prospects, the sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast is taken and eaten. By now, we expect this in the numerous films and dinosaur novels that have been published, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I saw where I really got bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> There are some laughs in it though. There is a scene in which a man is chewed by a carnotaur (brought back to life by the original film of the film) which a few seconds later becomes a giant bird of prey. Also, a bit of curiosity, this is the scene in which Steven Baur is shooting the scene of his death from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good film, it is a masterpiece compared to its sequel. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say this is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever aired. It's damn awful.
