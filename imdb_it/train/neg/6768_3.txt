Herbie, a man who thinks like a man, is back, now led by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing that stands in his way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them. <br /> <br /> The original love bug wasn't so good. Even as a child, I remember that I didn't like it very much. But I had some hope for the sequel. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes a movie look pretty funny. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than it was before. The film is weakly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain children but that's all. <br /> <br /> I realize that it is a film for children and everyone, but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it became boring towards the end. Most of the actors seemed dead even in their roles. Lindsay Lohan was as good as Maggie Peyton. It usually offers better performance than in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best interpretation to everyone. He was as good as the villain even though he didn't have much to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really there and they don't do anything special. <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson directs and does a good job. Try to keep the movie interesting but it's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the script and would it have been a surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light movies but they can't really make the stories interesting or fun. It's not entirely their fault, but I hope they will try harder next time. In the end, Herbie is a safe and predictable family film that is worth watching if you are a child. Everyone else is better off skipping it. Evaluation 4/10
