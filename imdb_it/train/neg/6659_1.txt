During the first 3 seasons the discreet parents were tasty like hard candies, bright, sweet and compelling. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you'll need after seeing the most recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence that didn't provoke laughter. Cosmo, once one of Nick's most endearing characters, has become a cruel abusive and insulting one that the Family Guy cast wouldn't even want to know. Timmy became a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot (and given Timmy's squawking, a lot of jokes would have been enough). And poor Wanda ... a real enchantress who has become the victim of her husband and godson, is now labeled a "nag" to take care of the welfare of others. Furthermore, Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else, but he is never punished for this, nor does he learn any lessons. Which sums up Butch Hartman's attitude towards children: they are rough, vulgar and not too bright. Thank God this crunchy toon has been canceled, along with Butch Hartman's dear Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.
