In the end I reached "Starlight" last night on television and all I can say is. . . Wow! It's hard to know where to start: Hokey's incredible special effects (look at the laser beams coming out of Willie's eyes!), The atrocious acting, the ponderous dialogue, the wrong use of the archive material or the air of pretentious seriousness that infuses the entire production. This is truly a unique experience and we should all be grateful for it. I name Jonathon Kay as the true heir of Ed Wood!
