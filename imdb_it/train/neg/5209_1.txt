Ok, so I was bored and watched it all the way. <br /> <br /> This film is mild, harmless and lackluster. The plot is so sugary that the opening credits go crazy. A queue of two "traumatized" children who have learned to know "God" the way fairy tales left me rather traumatized. Use the Irish "blarney" so stereotypically that it is hoped that no real Irish will ever see him. Addressed to children who frankly turn off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all, because they pump them out.
