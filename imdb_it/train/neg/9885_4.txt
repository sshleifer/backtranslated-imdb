Gets only the third billing (behind Arthur Treacher and Virginia Field), but this was the first starring role of David Niven and is as fascinating as the subdued Bertie Wooster of PG Wodehouse, master (in name only) of Jeeves, the most imperturbable of waiters. As an adaptation, it is more like a sunk THE 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian outing. And this is a shame because the interaction between Treacher and Niven is not too far from the brand. Alas, the mystery trophies of the film 'B' and the forced comedy become tiring even in just 57 minutes. Next year's sequel (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more offensive, without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all the people!) Forced to play the game.
