I didn't like this movie at all! First of all, I don't know why, but everyone here says that the work of Clémence Poésy is excellent, which in my opinion is absolutely wrong! It's not like Natasha: another appearance, another character ... What's worse, she's a very inexperienced actress and that's why she wasn't able to play this role! He completely disfigured the heroine! It was really disgusting to see her play! In my opinion, it would be much better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be much easier for her to understand the Russian soul for a Russian person. Unfortunately, Kutuzov looked like a drunk, who did not shave for 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his sight ... (Thank God, there are some actors in this film, whose show was fantastic! I suppose , that Alessio Boni did his job very well! I was pleasantly surprised! He is one of the few people who read the book, which is very important for the game, and I liked our Russian actors' games, it was really wonderful to watch them)) The only thing I liked about this job was the very nice view and the fantastic clothes! My advice is to read the book and to understand a true meaning, the goal, with which Leo Tolstoy wrote this masterpiece, and perhaps realize the whole idea of ​​the book ... 1 from 10
