Richard Dreyfuss is, indeed, in this film, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the "obsessed" director: he is the commercial / accounting director of the group. The box also describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless you use the term "erotic" rather freely. I would not have considered watching the film without Richard Dreyfuss as the main character. I could, however, have realized that Leonard Cohen's famous 60's hymn "Suzanne" was an artistic influence. In addition to the brief recitation of lines from the end of "Ulysses" by James Joyce, and an interesting visual reference at the end of "The Seventh Seal" by Ingmar Bergman, I found a miserable attempt to merge symbolic elements and moods immortalized in film as "Last year in Marianbad" and "Un Chien Andalou". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric artistic company, there are many superior films, ranging from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
