On the Steve Irwin show, it's hilly. He doesn't even try to be funny and he is, but his film wasn't even what I'd call a movie - I mean when that guy in his car is trying to kill him, he's just saying 'Oh, this is an unpleasant Bloke!' and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too! And then when the boy falls out of the car, wouldn't you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting I've ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve, she simply says "Steve". He didn't look scared or anything, he was just "Steve". I mean, I hate to sound rude, but it's not worth seeing. I love Steve Irwin but his film was just too stupid.
