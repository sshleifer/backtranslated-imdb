Slash movies are few and far between today, so when I heard about Cut I had high hopes and heard positive things. Those good things I heard were all wrong ... very wrong! This movie is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. All about it. Especially the origin of the murderer and the way he stays alive and how he took care of it in the end. There is nothing original or exceptional about this film. Just another wannabe slasher with those "Hip", "Self aware". "Film experts" characters. I'm so sick of that shit. Someone does something different because the kind of slash needs new blood, literally.
