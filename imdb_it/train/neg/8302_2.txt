Strange as a studio you think you can make a sequel to what used to be a classic Christmas story with a completely new cast and expect it to float. Sure, they used various actors for Batman, but in that case Batman was a classic character before the actor wore his cloak. In this case you had a classic character in the horn-rimmed glasses who wore Ralphy who wanted a red rifle for the ryder for Christmas ... Somehow we should forget it and accept another kid who has no resemblance to the original .. If I had not known it was a sequel I would never have imagined it from the cast ... except of course that Charles Grodin strives so much to imitate Darrin McGavin that you are constantly reminded that the original was far better ... /> <br /> In the end it might work if they played the film better. They would have to look for a like or simply ignore the original and not try to copy its appearance. This is just an economic imitation. The Ralphy does not evoke sympathy only the desire to seem that his character shoots or dies.
