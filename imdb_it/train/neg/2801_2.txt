After an almost gothic and fruity music video, the film begins with Cassidy, the singer who kills herself. In a perfect world that would be that and the credits would roll. We don't live in that world. The insipid members of the band decide to go to a clown to contact his dead essence. When I say clown, I mean real clown. He tells them that they will all die through the ghost of Cassidy (the spirit possesses Dora, one of the group mates) We could not care less since the characters are all boring, dull and extremely horribly performed. Written by Adam Hackbarth (a surname incredibly apropos if there is ever one), and directed by Corbin Timbrook (who after knowing The attendant and Tower of blood, must know that he continues to do shit to live), this film is a constant battle between the incompetence of the film and the need of the viewer to stay awake. Not enough blood to appease bloody dogs, nor enough nudity to satisfy the perverts. This film has absolutely nothing to recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Amanda Carraway becomes topless <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
