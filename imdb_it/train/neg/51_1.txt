this film was a big disappointment. the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and mean. the main characters were impossible to identify or even sympathize with. the character of the main protagonist was slimy like them. the sick room / greenhouse atmosphere lent itself to exaggerated theatrical performances. little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish civil war from this film. fortunately, I was in Spain and I realized that it is not realistic! Furthermore, the use of homosexual attraction as a horrible "horror" was also very offensive and poorly managed, while the DVD was packaged and advertised to attract gay viewers. the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles, as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess. I imagine that if you like to watch children and animals brutally killed, this movie might interest you in particular.
