I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see a slasher b-movie, but I ended up with a fecal question for my eyes. The acting was similar to looking at dry grass. I saw him play better in a softcore movie ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer came out of nowhere shocked me. How was this horror movie? <br /> <br /> the production value of this film, it was ridiculous at best. There were no fears. It seemed that a high school student had a new camera for Christmas. The plot was everywhere, if any. If you're bored looking for a bad horror movie to rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.
