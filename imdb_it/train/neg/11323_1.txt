This film will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It is incredible that anyone thinks that this film has earned the time and investment to do. I've seen movie "B" before but the movie "C" was just invented. I didn't think I'd ever appreciate Power Rangers since my children stopped watching, but I found myself looking for videos for fifteen minutes in "Knights". High school productions are better than this and the actors involved should delete it from their resume. Embarrassment is one of the many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies, even turned it off. Now he has to tell you something. If you watch this movie and you like it, I will pray for you.
