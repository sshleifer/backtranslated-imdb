I'm not a fan of horror movies, but my wife's grandchildren are. So, I saw the first movie. It was creepy and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons, at this very moment, I am exposed to a following. <br /> <br /> The premise itself is beyond the absurd. I can buy that disaster happens in the desert. I can buy mutants exist. I can also buy that the events could be so strange and strange that the military might decide to get involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I am willing to suspend my conviction. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military team in charge of reconstituting such an area would not be able to defend the mutants. As a member of the US Army, I can assure you that , while new recruits may not have the expert eyes and experience of fighting soldiers, any recruit of this type would be integrated into a skilled team. <br /> <br /> An armed squad the soldiers are not going to be eliminated by some mutants with knives. This is just the way it works. Team movements, vastly superior firepower and, of course, radio support, would not guarantee anything less than total victory. I'm not saying you wouldn't have had losses, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would have had precedence, no one would even have left alone to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so infested with enemies that the team was unable to handle the danger, they would have made radio for backup. And believe me, their radios wouldn't jam, if there was a chance that normal radios wouldn't work, the team would have a satellite phone for military issues. It is probable that a search would have been made if they were unable to check in every hour. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, you must accept that our soldiers are stupid incompetents, with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command. While it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and a compass, our military forces are full of intelligent, well-trained and competent soldiers. Knife mutants are far below our ability to cope. <br /> <br /> With the entire performance of the film depends strongly on the impossible to imagine, the film fails to deliver. Instead, it is expected that we believe that our soldiers, sailors and aviators are unable to face even the most mediocre threats. As a combat veteran, I find the film offensive.
