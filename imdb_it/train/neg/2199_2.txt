I captured "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I think I have some great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX business card. The story is rather lame. Poor lighting and camera operation, along with anything but great editing and music, make the movie look low quality. <br /> <br /> It is really too much to ask that FX short films have better stories and have the rest the technical production is on par with the FX! You can't just run away with fantastic effects in shorts, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big success. At least that quick, beautiful and even a little bit weird! None of this can be said about "Sorrows lost".
