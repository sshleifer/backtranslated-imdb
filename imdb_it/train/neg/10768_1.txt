This film makes Canadians and British out as idiotic idiots. Men get drunk and drink, and then scream / beat each other in almost every scene. Are women superfluous to history? I don't understand what they are for ?? they spend every scene causing an uproar, or worse, wandering around like a hypnotized cattle. Apparently, Canadian women are either wanderer bicker vagrants or giant hippie chicks. She is the standard girl, her losing boyfriend and her ridiculous evil mother whom we have already seen in countless films. <br /> <br /> Each character here is a childish and fascinating stereotype. Not to mention the fact that they all seemed to need a shower! And the idea of ​​any kind of scene involving sex with George Wendt ?? cringe ?? it's enough to make anyone laugh! I saw the movie because Samuel West was in it ?? but I can't understand why he would have accepted a role like this. Maybe he needed money. Ian Tracey is a superb actor - the only one with a vague moment of redemption, but his talent is wasted here. <br /> <br /> What about the rest of the plot ?? are the three idiots trying to get their drugs back? yawn - or Karl ?? who died, but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those who stayed behind (almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ?? even though I'm ashamed to have even thought of comparing these two films), why not even worry ? Karl is so irritable that he finds the circumstances of his gratifying death. <br /> <br /> At the end of this miserable movie, I thought it would be better to go down with him on that boat!
