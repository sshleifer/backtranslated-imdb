Ok .. this was not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I had heard it very well and was deeply disappointed. I could see where the directors came from and they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle were not very different from each other, that individuals were lost in the fighting, etc. Etc. . (well, this is my presumption, however = ^ _ ^ =) <br /> <br /> Anyway .. the film bores me. I have seen many very long movies, but this seemed to drag me over and over ... basically because I couldn't really care about any of the characters. I kept thinking .. who cares ??? I also found that the acting is rather dead and the dialogue is tense. I understand that this was the nineteenth century and everything, but most of the conversations seemed rather unnatural. No one seemed to have any emotion during most of the film, except during the melodramatic events. <br /> <br /> The "romance" in the story does not seem to be supported by anything other than "I'm a boy and you're a girl", which I don't consider very romantic, yet I felt I was guided by the belief that these people were love. Oh well .. I guess it's all "all this horror around us, we cling to each other" like what, or whatever. I was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (who initially both seemed to have an interest in the girl), but it was just a thing that had fallen. Perhaps avoiding a clich√© love triangle. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Oh well .. Daniel Holt was the only character I really liked. And Sue Lee was fine. I didn't exactly like Jake, but it seemed a little too much ... no backbone, I guess. Jack Bull didn't care at all. And I'm pretty sure that * you should * hate pretty much everyone else, except normal and poor people who are left and right cut. It was rather graphic and put down all that "horrors of war" story, but I saw many other films with the same theme, made better. (I really liked The Patriot, for example, even though it was a bit emotionally manipulative.) But, as I said, I'm a cynic. What can I say? :)
