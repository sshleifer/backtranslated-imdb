Frank Capra's creativity must have been almost exhausted when he made this film. While it has some fascinating moments and many wonderful performers, Capra's direct recycling not only of the script, but also a considerable movie of his first version of this story, Broadway Bill (1934), is decidedly poor. It is understandable that he would reuse the shooting of the climatic horse race, which is thrilling. But he uses whole scenes of dialogue with minor actors, then brings those actors back and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that Ward Bond is 14 years older! Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's last appearances, skip this and watch Broadway Bill instead.
