Oscar Wilde's comedy of good manners, perhaps the most playful comedy ever written, is almost destroyed by a second-rate cast. Sanders is, as you'd expect, casually, lazily brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington, but the rest of the cast makes the whole procedure a waste of time. Jean Crain attempts a stage accent with alternate phrases and the other cast members seem to believe that this is a melodrama and not a comedy; indeed, the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy - no doubt Hays's office insisted. Preminger's direction seems to be above all to make sure there are many servants and even the music seems trivial. Remain faithful to the visually perfect farce as directed by Lubitsch or even to the 2004 film version with Helen Hunt as Mrs. Erlynne; or try reading the game for the pleasure of words. But skip this version.
