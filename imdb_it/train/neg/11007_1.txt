Lately they have been trying to commit this movie late at night to cable TV commercials. Don't believe the hype. I was one of the unlucky to see this stinker in theaters. This is, in my opinion, the third worst movie of all time, just behind Mac & Me (worst number 1) and Jack Frost (worst number 2), but I must admit that they are all close and all TERRIBLE! In reality, nothing about this film is funny, or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be, so don't waste your money. The only good thing is to give to your worst enemy. I'm not lying about this. Someone you would like to kill or torture would be a great candidate for this film. It's terrible. If you don't believe me, you deserve to suffer from the pain of watching this, which I doubt you can finish. Two enthusiastic thumbs up.
