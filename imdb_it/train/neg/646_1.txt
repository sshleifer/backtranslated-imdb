I saw this movie by accident and this movie was an accident ... well, it must have been. blonde women are chased, the evil appears to disappear from one place to another in a minute, then disappearing and reappearing, hiding. He wasn't even a superhero, so I don't know how he did it. He couldn't scare a cat and it's not hard to do. <br /> <br /> the old "mirror in the bathroom" is no longer scary, in fact it stopped being scary years ago. you had the policeman on the trail of the bad guy, another cliché (played by idris elba with a very convincing American accent, he is from London) the director had no idea and made a film full of clichés and "scary move" it was a scary comedy, pathetic!
