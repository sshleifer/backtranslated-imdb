Here is a movie with a good cast and a nice location, but it doesn't have it. Director Richard Brooks must have been a little tired at this stage of the game; How much better was his THE PROFESSIONALS! The horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during non-slow motion scenes. This film had to be accelerated, if anything. That horse-foam gave me a terrible air for me and the obvious tire tracks in those moments of pursuit in the desert - just lazy. sloppy work. Sin. The actors did well, but I have certainly seen everyone do better. Ben Johnson is always a joy, though. I saw this film for the first time almost 30 years ago; he was disappointed and remained so after the second vision 30 years later.
