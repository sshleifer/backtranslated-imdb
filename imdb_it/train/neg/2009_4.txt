This is not a completely ugly film. The plot (the new house next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the mood is quite disturbing, and the acting is ok. The big problem I had is that, being familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I couldn't understand how different she is with her seemingly new lips. I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on his face! They make it look completely different (and no better). <br /> <br /> Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim the architect who designs and pours the heart and soul at home, does a good job. And even Lara (like Col) is pretty good (but those lips!) As the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is suitably of wood. Even the various characters who live in the house were fine. I particularly liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move into the house. The attempt to involve us in the general atmosphere of the neighborhood fails, unfortunately, since the other neighbors are not particularly nice. <br /> <br /> For some reason the director failed to make the haunted house particularly disturbing. Other films (like Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) manage to get that spooky feeling, but it just doesn't happen here. The closest is when Col paints a representation of the house. Another thing that didn't work out for me is the coup de theater that occurs with Kim, the architect. Initially, he seems to be a victim of the house like the others (he sucked him in inspiration), but later he seems to have joined forces with it in evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, not bad for horror fans if you can take your eyes off those big lips!
