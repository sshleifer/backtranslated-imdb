Well, I also heard all the reviews and comments breathless about how this movie could deserve the Oscar for the best photos, so I went to see it today. What a disappointment! 1) If you read the other reviews, you will learn from the members of the US military who have served in Iraq how unlikely this film event is. They reflected my thoughts; while the film was playing, I - a complete civilian - kept thinking of myself, "say WHAT? it's not possible for it to happen like this ..." 2) There is very little that happens in terms of plot. A new bomber shows up to replace one who has been killed (a death that is not clearly explained). The new guy gets an adrenaline rush from his work. His attitude puts others at risk. THAT'S ALL! 3) This film is nowhere so full of suspense as stated. If you want suspense, try one of the Bourne movies. If you want to see an emotionally powerful war movie, try hiring Go Tell The Spartans, which talks about the Vietnam War, and plays Burt Lancaster (who PERSONALLY told me at a fortuitous supermarket meeting that he was immensely proud and one that considered one of his best works, and that was still upset, had been largely ignored in the wake of the overwhelmed apocalypse Now), or an old black and white classic of World War II Sink The Bismark, which, especially for a The English film is incredibly heartbreaking. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON Hurt Locker.
