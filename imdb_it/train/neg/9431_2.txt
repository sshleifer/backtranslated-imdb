Foreword to the base film, 3 young women destroy their car and end up with a creepy family. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Watching the 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ's race with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN. <br /> <br /> Old lady with hot and cold dementia checking her daughter ... YAWN <br /> <br /> 23 minutes watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the hell they're eating ... OK, there could be a game to drink here ... no - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK I had my interest for a couple of seconds. <br /> <br /> Completely random and uninspired killings ... YAWN <br /> <br /> The ending ... dude! the psychopathic one is unbalanced - because the rest of the film could not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately it is so - My advice - go fast in the last five minutes and watch it and then put something good in the player - for me I'm going back to sleep.
