I finally saw THE INCUBUS after waiting for 20 odd years to see it and, surely, it wasn't worth waiting all this time to see it. The INCUBUS is a horror film strictly about the number: the invisible monster / monster is raping and killing women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The film is like this: the film opens with the killing; then bla bla bla; more blah blah blah; then another murder; even more blah blah blah; continue with blah blah blah; yet another murder (surprising, eh?); bla bla bla, etc ... <br /> <br /> The film is totally predictable from beginning to end. Even the stupid "big" red herring used in the film would not convince a 5-year-old child. And I discovered the secret identity of the nightmare when I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise came, I wasn't shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so funny that I kept on giggling days after watching the movie. It's so silly! <br /> <br /> However, the film is so famous that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few highlights in this sad film. It is a prominent scene, not necessarily because it is good, but because it is so funny and useless: the movie that plays on the big screen shows a moment similar to a rock video with a guy in red leather pants who obviously gets his hair cut fake, all this modified with scenes of a girl being attacked in the bathroom of the cinema by the nightmare. The best thing I could say about this film is cinematography, which I actually liked. But apart from that, there is almost nothing to talk about INCUBUS, except that it is unintentionally exhilarating.
