This movie is terrible. Not offensive but extremely predictable. The film follows the life of a family of small towns in the mid-1960s. The father, the school principal, is going through a mid-life crisis. Join a beautiful teacher from the big city who begins to challenge the minds of her students with some stimulating things, like thinking for yourself. The principal does not agree with his teaching but is pretty. You can connect the points. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with the lifestyle of the small town and wants to live. He gets some wrong tips, hangs up with some bad boys and apparently family planning is not taught in his school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has worked mainly on TV, this movie sounds like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms.
