my friend bought the movie for 5 ?? (not even worth 1 cent), because they wrote that it was like an American pie. but soon we would discover that there is a long way from the American pie to that piece of shit. it's not even a comedy, it's more like a really really bad documentary. not only is the story ugly, even the image and the sound are a problem. they put alcohol, chicks, dwarves and drunken teenagers. and the result is a disaster. if you see this movie, don't buy it, rather spend your money on something else, and better. if you're going to torture yourself, then don't invite your friends, unless you hate so much and you want to get rid of them.
