The simple thoughts of "Going Overboard" (aka "Babes Ahoy") make me want to cry. Throwing yourself out of a window would be better than watching this movie. It's not even a supposed movie "so bad it's beautiful". I would like to spend money to buy copies of this film and burn them so that people can't see them. Oh the pain, the pain ...
