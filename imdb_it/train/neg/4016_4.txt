There is a DVD published in the United Kingdom in 2002 Code HRGD002 on the cover, without ASIN, VFC 19796 on the disc, no IFPI code in the inner circle. <br /> <br /> Probably a direct transfer from VHS. <br /> <br /> There isn't much to do by commenting on a movie for adults. But this contains a minimal plot and the characters are believable. It was shown in the United States in normal cinemas. <br /> <br /> I saw it at Pensylvannia way back in 1975. <br /> <br /> As such it deserves a place in a film encyclopedia. The DVD has no special features and no subtitle, and was probably made using a VHS tape as a source
