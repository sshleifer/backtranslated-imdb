I've read comments that you shouldn't watch this movie if you're trying to mix Shakespearean dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the moving dialogues, contains this wonderful work, have been cut and replaced with songs. I read this play, and recently I was lucky enough to see it performed, as it remains one of my favorite Shakespearean comedies, but this film seems to take everything I like. The Princess, though no doubt doing what she was meant to do, had no royal bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the intelligence of their characters - also struck by poor cuts, which not only took away from female characters an already scarce dialogue, but took the comments out of context - it was a bit unnerving to hear the princess proclaim; "We are wise girls to make fun of our lovers like this!", When the mocker hadn't happened at all. The news that followed one another during the film also interrupted the flow and took away many excellent scenes, as the information in the scenes after them showed, and were in modern phrasing. In conclusion, an excellent work, ruined by a bizarre concept and senseless cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What were you thinking?
