Sistas in da cap. Looking for revenge and bling bling. Except Da Hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s. I don't remember any westerns like this when I was growing up. What would Randolph Scott say? If he had seen Lil 'Kim, he could have said: "Okay, I have to admit that I have tuned myself to this just to see it: naked nudes and low blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy movie, but these are the cowgirls , and they're fine. <br /> <br /> Now, don't go looking for any important stories here, and the usual stuff of the ghetto crime drama is here in a different context, and when is the last time you have heard John Wayne call someone, "Dawg"? And, I don't remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before marching to the OK Corral. <br /> <br /> I watch him on BET, so I lost the action is an R rating, but I doubt I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured that it was Lil Kim in that action.
