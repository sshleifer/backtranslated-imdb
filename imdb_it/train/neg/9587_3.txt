Recreation of the 1950s (London) of Soho and promising people. Based on a cult novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more nor less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll give you a $ 15 million pop video. Here forget that two minutes with people who can't really act are one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking? Besides who is the public? Who cares about a book that was well remembered as it used to be. The usual London story of the chancer who takes his chance. <br /> <br /> What could really drag this film even lower? Oh, I know, third-level songs that sound like they were made on the spot. David Bowie signs the movie title over and over again and this is the highlight. The soundtrack album is pigeon clay material. <br /> <br /> There is a good thing though. Good recreation of the Soho period. Too bad they can't think of anything to face.
