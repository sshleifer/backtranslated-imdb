This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a collection of recycled material. People who are hit in the head are not funny. People who kick themselves are not funny. After the third time a boy was kicked in the balls, even the youngest member of the audience was laughing. He got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. He really laughs aloud at King of the Hill, but this cinematic masterpiece bores her. I'm not surprised. The story is rather lame. A tiny thief steals a big diamond in what was certainly the easiest robbery in Hollywood history. Then he hides with a family that pretends to be a child. I know it sounds exciting but this is the whole story. Say these two lines over and over again for 1.5 hours and you'll get the image. There were predictable jokes galore. I felt really ripped off after seeing this. I didn't expect much and was disappointed. I wish Keenan would only hire decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. This was even worse than White Chicks if possible. I've seen better and less expensive school plays. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this film. I don't like my entertainment being minimized.
