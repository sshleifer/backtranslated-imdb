Usually, I don't think Hollywood productions are suitable for being called movies, so I call them "movies". But this piece of elephant manure is not even suitable to be called a movie, hence the citations in the title. <br /> <br /> Where should I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of geriatric casting, it is certainly the epitome of it. Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone under half her age, she should play an eighteen year old, and she is forty and makes two !! <br /> <br /> 2. A horrible and stupid mindless portrait of Paris and France, in which we see clich√© characters such as: the sympathetic master of the store, the queen of models, the former queen of models, etc. This film is only surpassed in this respect by the Da Vinci Code, (which the reviewers correctly determined was a comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is highly and absolutely ridiculous not to have nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was such a common place, especially if the focus is all on this > <br /> 4. The horrible accents !!! <br /> <br /> 5. The music of Nana Mouskouri's elevator !!! <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think this is enough. And I was able to make these observations after watching this shit for half an hour, while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about mathematical equations ... I mean ... !!!!! <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
