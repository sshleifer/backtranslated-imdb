Why does this film fall OK under the standards? Ultimately, the answer lies in the poor script and without humor. A thin and mediocre-looking Travolta (it seems rather dapper in black, I must say, even with a huge mullet) and Gross both act very well as two young New Yorkers with dark but witty hair, eager to open their nightclub. Apart from that, the rest of the film is simply boring to watch. It's so boring that it's not really worth knowing what happens in the film's climax at any level. Kelly Preston, obviously, exudes sexual charm and her husband Travolta's sexually charged dance is one of the few pleasures in the film. Charles Martin Smith is pretty fun to watch while the KGB, in the fight, is "Bob Smith". Personally, I think the film would have been better if the plot had changed a little so that the settings didn't change from New York to "Indian Springs, Nebraska" (which is in the former Soviet Union?) - you'll understand if you see the film ... Apparently, this film was shot in 1986, ready for a 1987 release. I imagine that Paramount was stuck in publishing the film until January 1989 due to the incredible plot. It was reported that they considered him "unstoppable". However, this $ 6,000,000 movie garnered a little over $ 163,000 in embarrassing entries, as only BRIEFLY was released in places like Texas and Colorado before moving directly to video. This is the testament to the overall BAD quality of this film.
