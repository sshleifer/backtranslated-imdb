"The Domino Principle" is, without doubt, one of the worst thrillers ever made. There is virtually no sense of the twisted plot and halfway through you will want to raise your arms in frustration and shout "I give up !!!" <br /> <br /> Like Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer he has never been involved in this casino and must be summed up only by his paycheck. <br /> <br /> I hope they spent their money well.
