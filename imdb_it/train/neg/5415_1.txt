Dil was a memorable film that brought a great director like Indra Kumar to celluloid. The film was followed by Beta, Ishq, Raja and Masti, all excellent. <br /> <br /> But then every successful director also gives some horrible films and some hits. Pyare Mohan is one of these films. <br /> <br /> Even if the comedies are told well but then they can't laugh. Compared to the type of comedy films that are made today, this is stupid. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch it. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry alone. <br /> <br /> In short, the film deserves to be lost.
