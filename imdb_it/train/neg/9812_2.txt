Not only was the plot of this film conceived with the ease with which the two psychopaths are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating but it was a terrible "Misery" rip-off. However, the main reason why I gave this film such a low grade was because it totally disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I am not a person easily shocked by what filmmakers like and have always had a love for horror films, but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just to get points in the shock factor. <br /> <br /> I think that most people, looking only at the first ten minutes of "Hide and Search", will find themselves reaching for the remote control.
