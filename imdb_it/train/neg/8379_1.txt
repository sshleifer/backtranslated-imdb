As some of the other reviewers have mentioned before, I'd like to know that moron actually read the script and left "," Yes !!! This is the next movie we will go to the green light! "And whoever that person is, he should have his head examined for actual brain activity. Because whoever is responsible for spending money on doing it after reading the script, well, I'd like to give you my email address and maybe you "I'd just like to give some extra money. This movie is atrocious anyway. <br /> <br /> Wayans are fun, at least they can be. They made good movies and made incredibly fun performances along the way. But here, not only does the premise escape all logic, not only is acting terrible, not only is the entire film offensive from beginning to end, not only is the direction as amateur as you can find, but in reality they want you to pay to watch this movie. Maybe if it was free ... naaah, it would still be a waste of time. <br /> <br /> I would usually be inclined to write a long and detailed review on why this movie is so ugly, but suffice it to say that I allow my brevity to speak. This is the film with the lowest common denominator, and it's not as funny as a heart attack. <br /> <br /> 0/10 .. is my list of the best films of all time!
