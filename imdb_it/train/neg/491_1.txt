As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in his portrayal of the artist's life and I was the first to be very annoyed and offended ... by his transformation of his rape into a tragic love story, by the implication that his rapist was responsible for 'awakening his talent', with his utter disregard for his work, from the way he turned her into a sexual object, back and forth, you got the idea. Furthermore, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi see this film and leave with that kind of impression.
