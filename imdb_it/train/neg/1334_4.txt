So I finally saw the movie "My Left Foot" last night after years of how my mother told me how surprising ... The central performance of Day-Lewis is truly remarkable and surprising, but anyone has even a minimum exposure to his other work should expect nothing less. <br /> <br /> The fatal error of assessment in my eyes was to become obsessed with experiencing this man's normality; the film has chosen to show it as a complete and complete asshole. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation; humanity always has the capacity to be debatable, and disability should not obscure it. I only hope that impartial viewers are not as lenient towards aberrant behavior and assume that the circumstances make it automatically forgivable. They don't. Acting is normal, and therefore yes, disabled people act - but they do not because they are disabled; they do it because they are unreasonable. A physical disability does not give you the right to throw a hiss in public, just because someone you love disappoints you. <br /> <br /> There are certain things that it is not wise to do if you are disabled or capable-bodied. Giving someone tacit permission to kick in directly to your head for the sole purpose of adapting is one of them. (Of course, I once saved a penalty from the school star striker with my face, but at that time I already belonged. It was not for acceptance.) Engaging in a bar fight is another. Enjoying the fact that your father only extends to your company after proving yourself capable of jumping metaphorically through physical circles brings masochism to a step too far. All these things are stupid, and suffering for them as a way to show your courage doesn't make them any less daring. <br /> <br /> So yes; just because you've overcome the obstacles to get great things doesn't make you an idiot any less ... Being a good person has priority; setting an inspirational example for the disabled should appear at the bottom of the list.
