this film is made for the Asian / Chinese market, especially for fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest stars of Asian music. Jay Chou is a very talented writer / singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he appeared in several big-budget productions ("initial D", "The Curse of the Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he won both the golden horse (taiwan) and the Hong Kong film award for "D initial". <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is very well chosen, which attracts virtually everyone from China. The cast includes many famous film / television actors, singers and even sports commentators (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they did not have enough time to showcase their talents. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu took on both the directorial and screenwriter positions. It has the reputation of creating superficial and mindless films based on inconsistent scripts. With his poor direction and his fabulous history, the entire cast of talent, the imaginative visual effects and the tones of the production have been wasted. <br /> <br /> However, the terrible film has successfully cashed over $ 10 million, perhaps even more in Asia, which has made this one of Asia's biggest box office hits. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: you can only watch this movie if you want to see how money and talent are wasted, or if you are simply accompanying your children who are Jay Chou fans.
