This is really one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a HUGE zombie movie fan and usually tolerates bad acting, "special effects" blades a stupid story and anything you may encounter in second-tier movies, SO MUCH WHY the movie has a good atmosphere / story / suspension or any other thing to offer. This has virtually no positive aspect and is third or fourth, perhaps worse. Some of my friends and I did a little movie during a week's vacation and I certainly did a better job (no zombie movies though). <br /> <br /> This movie is not even funny, it doesn't talk about anything else. Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white skin leaning against their faces), WAY TO MUCH fake blood (I really like realism, the combination of realism and Zombie movies is questionable, but the gore presented is simply silly). The camera remains quite long with power supply scenes, it gets boring and you can't help but wonder, why do zombies use ARMS (!) To kill prey. I won't go into the dubbing details (others did). Although I'm German and I'm at least a little curious about the original version, I won't waste much of my time on this film. <br /> <br /> Stay away from me as much as you can.
