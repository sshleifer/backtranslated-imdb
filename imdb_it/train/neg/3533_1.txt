Let this film serve as a dozen to the "big twist" films of the 90s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this slight touch of cinematographic hand was made to death by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard used a variation in A BEAUTDUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna") uses the Soze motif in a much more obsequious manner. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very questionable head of hair) plays as Jack Green (known to all as "Mr. Green.") He may or may not be Mr. Gold's criminal genius. Or perhaps Mr. Gold is an irritable spirit who can possess members of the underworld. I'm not sure, but I certainly don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most exaggerated examples of film excesses that I have had the regret of enduring for a long time. Witness of the fragmented temporal structure, of the painful jump cuts, of the incessant interior monologues and of the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This style of "everything in the kitchen" makes Quentin Tarantino's appearance calm. The smoke and the cinematographic mirrors lead me only to believe that Ritchie was bored to tell this banal story while I was watching it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments of revelation that are apparently shocking but only come as news to Mr. Green. I wanted to please Green as I always like Stratham as a character who is a stone's throw from everyone. Here, however, he fights as a corrective reader in a class of university English literature. His lack of intelligence is matched only by the lack of moderation shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Celebrating on the landscape like a starving at a buffet, Liotta spits, cries and smokes through the film in an embarrassing show of exaggerated speedos and leopard print. <br /> <br /> There are no redeeming qualities for REVOLVER. It is yet another Ritchie film misstep and could even surpass his miserable SWEPT AWAY remake as his worst film.
