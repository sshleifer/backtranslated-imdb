When I first saw this film, I immediately noticed the actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. Rachy York's Rachel York portrait is absolutely horrible. Lucille Ball was a stunning comedian with an incredible talent. Thinking of a legend like that of Lucille Ball that was portrayed in the film is horrendous. I can't believe all the actresses in the world who could play Lucy so much better, the producers have decided to get Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is hard. It's pretty hard to find someone who looks like Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a little similar in appearance and talent. If you noticed the portrait of Lucy of York in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way - her expression, voice or movement. <br /> <br /> To complete it all, Danny Pino who plays Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal and, once again, his acting is incredible. Even though Fred and Ethel weren't the same, they weren't as bad as Lucy and Ricky's characters. <br /> <br /> Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is told poorly. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest looking at Lucy and Desi's A & E Biography, reading the book by Lucille Ball herself, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "Before the laugh" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Laughter" is much better than this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.
