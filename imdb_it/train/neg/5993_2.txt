I grew up (in 1965) watching and loving the Thunderbirds. All my classmates at school watched. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, during lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. The countdown from 5 has become an art form. I took my kids to watch the movie hoping they could take a look at what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only high point was the melody of the snappy theme. Not that it could be compared to the original Thunderbird score. Fortunately, early Saturday morning a TV channel still plays Gerry Anderson series replicas and his wife created. Jonatha Frakes should deliver his director's chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of film. Absolutely rubbish. A CGI remake may be acceptable, but replacing the puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens was a huge error of judgment.
