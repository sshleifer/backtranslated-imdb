I waited for this movie to sound great. Assuming that it would be portrayed more accurately as the movie "The Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to friends and relatives asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a small part of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only daughter in November 2003 and who REALLY knew the pain, I had hoped that this film could shed light on parents who "think" that they understand the pain of a parent who has lost a child. This film was a very light film and Diane Keaton's stupidity was a slap in the face to the parents who buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from beginning to end. I received some calls after the movie, each identical, "It was so out of place and I made it appear that in a short time you are traveling again and listening to songs on the radio and life is back" What a pile of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither of them would have ever made the film to be so out of place. I guess it's Hollywood.
