Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer who said that "strange people with generous tastes have reviewed this film". I thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it. I think it was mainly due to Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. <br /> <br /> The end result is that this film is slightly psychologically appealing on one side and profoundly homophobic on the other. Thumb up on the previous thumb and triple on the latter. I am not sure that the film is intended to promote dialogue or spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought acting was mediocre. A lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees back on reality. I still wanted to get some meaning out of the plot, but in the end it's just a conversation with a madman (Speedman). I feel slightly sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. Its loss is not greater and certainly it is less than the losses suffered every day all over the world from more significant causes. <br /> <br /> Does the film reveal naivety about HIV / AIDS? Yes: the expected audience. Is HIV a dark, mysterious and evil killer? What about the victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malicious intentions than lupus, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, cancer or their victims, FOR GOD'S GOD. Just because a disease is transmissible does not make it FACT either negligent - or evil - it is just BEING. <br /> <br /> Does this excuse ignorance or risk-taking? - NO. Should all people practice safe sex? - YUP. Will safe sex save the world? - NO. Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and lust among passionate and emotional human beings? ?? OBVIOUSLY NOT. In what kind of world would we live if everyone respected the rules, nobody ever risked, and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ??? Am I ignoring that the film is specifically about gay sex? ?? YUP. HIV spreads by sharing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected individuals. Sex is not necessary for transmission, gay or otherwise. <br /> <br /> I am always disturbed by the voluntary violence of one person over another. Actually I thought the film had done a good job in portraying Tom's absurdity of kidnapping, imprisonment and violent intent, and this kind of mad violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Stream of consciousness notes from the movie: Tom is crazy. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't Dan ask "why" do you feel this way, rather than "what are you doing"? Implication: men who have sex with men suffer AIDS "Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in the sexual act? Why was it Dan's responsibility to use a condom?" Maybe you slipped it before "What are we talking about here? One of the parts was unconscious?" Maybe he didn't want to hear the truth "you're kidding me" She's in heaven and so incredibly hurt by what she now knows about me ??? Dan has finished life if you have HIV? Certainly not! Is this the reason why the whole world is so homophobic ???? Do they think gays are the cause of HIV, that they will give it to the rest of the world and we all die? But are you kidding ??? People are really stupid enough to think that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ??? We feel so about tuberculosis victims? Of malaria? Can I see that Tom is hurt because of his wife's death, and blames him for AIDS, but seriously? to here? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (assuming that they were not looking for or trying to spread the disease). Sure, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but that's not driving, not flying, not leaving the house, not living. Do we really want to blame the victims' illness? Would the safe sex between Tom and Dan prevent the final death of Tom's wife? Perhaps, but not Dan's sole responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. I said this. <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "maybe you have what you deserve" ?? COME ON! 24 days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Am I exaggerating? Maybe. But I think this film tells homosexual men their reckless and malicious intent towards a "hetero world" by practicing unsafe sex, when the rate of homosexuals who practice safe sex is proportionately equivalent to or better than that of heterosexuals. We all need to wake up and take HIV / AIDS seriously. HIV is killing hundreds of thousands of Africans each year.
