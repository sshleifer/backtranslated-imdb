American Pie: Beta House is a kind of limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy without plot and a few really clever jokes. On the other hand, it is porn that is a bit too soft-core to actually turn on the viewers. Essentially, Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple of subtle plot points thrown into a cohesive effort. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most of the development is based on the knowledge of Naked Mile, and the "important" scenes of the plot are so distant that you wonder why writers felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, I didn't go into this movie without expectations. I liked the first three American Pie films and thought that Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was good enough to be distributed in movie theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were coming back for Beta House, I was excited to see this episode. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I enjoyed it, because in the past these scenes were supported by the plot and well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the authors forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity they forgot to actually write a story. <br /> <br /> This film is a disappointment and is not even worth a dollar rent. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the appearance of porn is too quiet if that's all you really want to see.
