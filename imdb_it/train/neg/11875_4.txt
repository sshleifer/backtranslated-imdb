Mmm, doesn't a big pile of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and canned fruit on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. TO EAT. WE EAT, YOU !!! Continue to spread it in your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You just had the experience of Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> I came across this show in the winter of '98 and was immediately won over. Like that stack of pancakes, I gorged myself. But the enjoyment soon ran out, because the character of Ally McBeal (who at first sight seems to us cute and appealing) soon became the most annoying, insecure, plaintive plaintive you have ever encountered. (Call me feminist, but I prefer that my female lead to having a backbone.) Even the gags and gimmicks of the show become hackneyed, Vonda Shepherd's music (which is really pushed in the face) becomes grateful and the incessant character changes and rewritings make the show a damn soap opera. <br /> <br /> My advice is to take this show in small doses and to stop as soon as it becomes annoying (and it will be). I did it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment was totally soured. It was nice while it lasted, but as a crazy and neurotic ex-girlfriend she became ugly after she passed her welcome. <br /> <br /> And the next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like a cup of fruit. I will sit with you much better.
