I love comics. Even if I have problems to fully understand the stories ?? the visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I wanted. Surprisingly I understood the main plot ?? but some extremely scarce decisions have been taken for his visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really ugly "CG human actors" - in the foreground? ??Why?! It didn't work at all !! Horus - and the other gods of Egyption - was successfully realized in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /> <br /> I think that with the real actors this film could have been a cult film. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
