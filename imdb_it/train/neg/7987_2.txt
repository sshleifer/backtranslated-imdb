I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" attractions in 1982, when Epcot opened, but now it's just silly. The message of the film is a clich√©. The Circle-Vision is confusing. And that terrible song in the end is jarring. And I really wish they would install seats. After so much walking, all you want is to sit for a few minutes. And when you hear that there is a movie to see it, it looks quite fascinating! You have fun while sitting down, right? MISTAKEN! You stand there for 18+ minutes leaning against a small railing. Disney should create a new Maelstrom as an attraction to revive things and replace this boring and lackluster movie. IT'S NOT FUNNY. Salta. In fact, all Canada jumps unless you eat there. Move directly to the UK.
