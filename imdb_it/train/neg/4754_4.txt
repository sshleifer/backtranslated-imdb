I loved the original. It was great and always will be. Oddly though, I couldn't wait to see the re-make. I'm usually a little upstream because there are too many, but somehow this intrigued me. I really liked it a lot to begin with. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law who manages to keep is right next to him. It was smart enough how it was modernized and worked. What prevents you from being really good is the last seven minutes. It moves away completely from the original, but in fact it is no longer intelligent and becomes annoying. The end in the original was fantastic! So much tension was created and it was incredibly smart! This? It grows not in tension but in frustration because they seem to have decided to make the character of Caine homosexual. It was if they were trying the hard to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll credits. This film deserves the watch simply for the performances, but those last seven minutes really do. What a pity....
