Anyone who was not aware of the original 1973 Lion movie "The Wicker Man" would undoubtedly have left the cinema with the impression of "Poor" and "Peurile". <br /> <br /> As a devotee of the original I left Purely Poor. <br /> <br /> From the sad reality of the false thoroughbreds pulling the force of law and order into a network of pagan barbaric rituals on a remote Scottish island, called Summerisle (the original) to a nearby offshore Amazon colony of the coasts of Maine, in the USA, called Summersisle, the remake hardly hits the target. <br /> <br /> This is, very sadly, a case of what "could" have been a classic remake of a classic that is tampered with to satisfy a simple audience. NOTHING MORE AND NOTHING LESS. <br /> <br /> Gentlemen (or given the revised context of the film) The ladies involved ... hang their heads in shame.
