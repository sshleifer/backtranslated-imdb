This film seemed to have everything with a good camera, sound, film, set, music, costumes ... but the drum roll, spoke Gary Stretch! I don't know if it was his poor acting or just a bad script, but I would say it was both. Considering the choice of him in this role, I found it difficult to root him to the end. I wish he had died in battle or in one of the sword and knife fights. <br /> <br /> So, was the bait for the plot to kill the king because the king had not dined and had sex with his Queen? Pretty lame. And go to the extreme to kill your son? And then pushing his lover up as a successful king? I see a couple of lines here and there of historical bytes, but the way in which all this was presented is farcical. <br /> <br /> I don't recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but it was terrible. I read another user's comments on the audio that is being nicknamed, but I don't think he was nicknamed ... after all, he speaks English, right? It was really horrible. The lines were read right on the coroner's table ... flat line. It could be that he doesn't have the voice to bring fluctuations of tone. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I watched it until the end, so the film had at least one "interest". It could have been more if the script / lines and casting had had more work. The scenery and filming of the crew along with high quality films are what made this film above all. The cast and the story were all secondary. I give the film crew a 10.
