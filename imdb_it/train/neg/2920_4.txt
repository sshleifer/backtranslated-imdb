Wow! I am shocked to learn that it is a small world and that we are all interconnected. What a waste of 88 minutes. John Dunne put it much better in one sentence. "No man is an island." The acting was not bad. The boys gave everything they had but sometimes the thread became so thin that I couldn't follow it and the only real "hero" in the film ends up in prison after being tormented by a one-meter waitress. I do not know. I just don't understand. Oh good.
