I couldn't wait to see Amanda Peet in another good role after renting "The Whole Nine Yards" recently - it's worth hiring, by the way - but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I remembered that the "Whipped" trailer was a bit strange and the plot of three great twenty-three New Yorkers who fell in love and were manipulated by the charming lady Peet was worth trying. So one afternoon I convinced two friends to come and see this movie with me. This review is my penance. <br /> <br /> In the first act we have the three main pins, which tell about their achievements in a diner. What should have been fun, or at least narrative, is rather pathetic. Was there any quality of salvation on the three men and their encounters that we had to get from this? <br /> <br /> [And even though I don't deal with films that are cheerfully vulgar, I kept wondering why no one in the dining room turned when the studs spoke loudly about sexual and wild details. Do they do it every week at the same restaurant? You would think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: two other diners notice it in a scene. But this is just a setup for a punch line. All the others in the dining room are deaf. <br /> <br /> The second act requires that the three stallions all fall to Mia and then develop the cerebral rottenness, failing to ask each other what is really happening between the four of them. And I kept asking myself, how do the nails continue to behave as they were, what redeeming qualities do you see them staying with more than one date? Does it start with brain rot? I kept hoping that the character of Eric, the married friend, became something more than the annoying punching bag in this act. His role is clearly to dispense advice to be married. But why do they even worry about talking to him when they won't talk to each other? And his advice? Sheeesh! <br /> <br /> The third act resolves the plot that exists but I was now looking at my watch. My friends told me they were still waiting for something really funny to happen and that I had to agree. The Scene That Explains All was adequate and able to explain all the questions and mysterious bits of dialogue during the film, but we were just checking them from a list. ("Oh, ok, that's why Brad happened and Jonathan says this and ...") <br /> <br /> The laughter we made was from the stupidity of the plot rather than anything funny. Even the outtakes during the credits were not very funny. In the end I was left with only the desire to warn people of this film. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3
