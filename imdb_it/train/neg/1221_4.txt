I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing but a pretty face that adorned films with characters like stupid Blondie, romantic interest or damsel in distress. But everything changed when he won an Oscar for best supporting actress for his role in the excellent film LA Confidential, and I think I wasn't the only one who was surprised by his solid performance. However, after that moment, his career did not follow the ideal path. Of course, the prestige that won thanks to that film made her participate in moderately prestigious films (such as People I Know or The Door in the Floor), but we never saw her again on an important character. The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put it in that situation; and it's not just that his character isn't too tasty, but also that the film is really lousy. The script of this film could not be more empty and simple. However, Basinger brings some conviction to his character, and this makes this poor movie to win some points. This film is full of clich√©s and generic villains. The work of the director Susan Montford is really disastrous for many reasons, but above all, because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this film is extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend at all while she was out. This film commits the capital sin of being boring.
