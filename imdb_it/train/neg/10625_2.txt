I'm an eleventh grader at my high school. In my current International Affairs class a child in my class got this video and suggested we watch. So we did. I firmly believe that we went to the moon, since my father works for NASA. Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen, the guy who created it has serious balls. First of all he had to show JFK to shoot? And how dare you use all those biblical quotes. The only positive thing about this film is the spark of debates, which is good b / c in my class that we have weekly debates. This film did nothing to change its mind. I think he and Michael Moore should work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next film could be titled "A Funny Thing Happens on Spetember 11th" or "A funny thing happened on the way to the White House".
