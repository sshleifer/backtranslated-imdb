When I saw the previews of this film I thought it might be stupid, but at least it will be fun. Well, I was wrong. Even if somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about the parents left alone and about the revaluation of their lives, the way they tried to convey that message was horrible. The first fifty times something stupid happened to the couple was relatively amusing. But in the end, I could almost predict what a stupid incident will happen next. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film I like a total of perhaps five lines of dialogue and everything else was mediocre at best, which is even more than I can say for the film itself.
