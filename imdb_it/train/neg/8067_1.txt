First of all let me say that this must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I want to say that nothing in this film is even remotely electrifying. Most are very confused and as they progress, I just wish it would end !! Some people want a film that makes them "think" through the whole thing, to which I say ... "More power for you" !! On the other hand, I just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment isn't. This film is stupid and a complete waste of time. It seems that here too he agrees. Most of it doesn't make any sense, and when you think you have a scene you understand that another lame scene is approaching and ... well, I guess you see where it's going. Avoid, this sucks .... bad !!
