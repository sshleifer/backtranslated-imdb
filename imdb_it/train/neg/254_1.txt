Ah, get out. How do I hate you? Let me count the ways. 1. Try to be fun, but you are banal and not happy; every bar is predictable and predictable, and when it arrives, it does not inspire laughter. Instead, I want to throw it. 2. Try to be dramatic, but they are incredible; the woman exaggerates terribly, and the "bad guy" looks like Bill Gates, and it's as scary as ... well, Bill Gates. (Just try to imagine Bill Gates trying to intimidate someone with a gun.) It doesn't work, does it? A lawyer, maybe, but not a gun. It's not good.) As for Jamie Foxx, well, just looking at him trying to offer a dramatic and heartfelt dialogue is ridiculous and makes me want to throw it. 3. Try to be full of action, but instead I am boring and dragging too many times. And when the action overheats, the tripod for the camera must have been lost, because the scenes fluctuate more than those in The Blair Witch Project, and I find myself sick, and once again I want to throw it. 4. Try to be a good movie, but you failed, you failed, you failed! I'd rather walk barefoot across the Sahara with a pack full of dried meat and no water, no sunscreen and only Meryl Streep for company. This hell would be nicer than an extra minute spent watching everyone in Bait make their way through an idiotic story with Bill Gates for a bad boy, and we don't even talk about the bomb exploding in a car that Jamie Foxx's character has just turned OFF OFF CLIFF, but somehow manages to escape ... kill me now, or do the right thing and promise me that somehow I will never have to watch a movie that is so bad, never again.
