Imagine you're a high school boy, in the back of a dark, uncrowded theater with your girlfriend. How bad a movie should be, so that you would feel compelled to leave the theater and go home before it ended? This movie is so ugly. Really. Movies often become so bad that they are good; this film is beyond that phase of malice. It's painfully bad. Bad horribly, terribly, crime against humanity.
