Oh, let's get people to take a break at this movie. The only thing I liked was ......... Sorry, still thinking. Oh yeah!!!! When John Wayne arrived and shot the bad guys. Oh, sorry, wrong movie, I was thinking of a better quality movie. Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yes, the girl who was at Clueless was inside. Don't put down Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you did a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that was never done in a western cast, even a female one, they really hung a woman at the gallows. It could be a western first. Even though his neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, however, you have to give the director an effort to try a western first. Also, I have never seen a woman lynched by a horse in any western, even if this didn't happen in this movie, I just thought of giving the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Wood Monster's Bride # 2. Maybe it was what the creators of this movie were doing. Originality, especially with a cast of African women and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you might have such a slang as, "Hey, don't fool yourself for my homegirl" and "speak in hand , baby, speak to the hand ". You could also have a surfer type deputy marshal who says things like, "That gunfight was TOTALLY totally a RAD man." You know things like that.
