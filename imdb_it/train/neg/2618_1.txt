... because this was just awful. 101 Dalamatians was fun even if formidable, but this is nothing but childish. The same plot except for the story that came out of it; the most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw of the world; Tim McInnerny proves he can't really do comedy (everyone remembers that Percy was in Blackadder, but that was his highest point - it was all downhill since then); A direction so poor that if a group of university students had done it you would have thrown it in the trash and told it to do it again - correctly this time. Ieuan Grufford will return better to Hornblower, while Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu should hide for several years. <br /> <br /> Maybe I could be too hard; after all I couldn't sit down for the whole movie. Gets 1/10; just because I can't give it 0.
