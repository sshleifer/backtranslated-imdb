This film was made for Dani (and Cradle of Filth) fans. I'm not one of them. I think he's just an imitator on the black metal bandwagon (again, I'm usually not a fan of black metal). But while I was bringing this DVD to pay for it, I became convinced that the less authentic thing is all the more because it tries to be convincing. So I imagined doing a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do-it-yourself splatter with a sinister backdrop. Now this is what I like. <br /> <br /> I returned home and entered it. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL machine work and DISGUST quality. And it was then (2002) that it seemed to have been shot using a Hi8 video camera. I left it on the shelf. Perhaps a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a pleasant environment for this ... image. <br /> <br /> After a couple of months I came back to it (in the mentioned surroundings) and saw half of it. So not only the aspects mentioned bothered me. My dislike has evolved. I noticed how Dani (1.65m; height 5'5 ") looked in his wedges tearing the head off a robber (Yes, he tears, his head apparently didn't have a skull.) I also found out that this movie could have I don't have still finished, so I haven't finished yet, so I wasn't positive. <br /> <br /> After another couple of attempts I finally managed to finish this movie - a couple of months ago ... (Yes, I have it took 5.5 years.) So - Dani actually was fun as HELPER of Satan / Manson / super-evil-man and the film made no sense. See our bad person employ Dani to do bad things. "I guess it's just very, very bad. In fact they are both and that's it. <br /> <br /> We have a couple of stories joined by the character of Dani. My favorite was about a boy, who's DOING SOMEONE THE LEG, because he wants to use it as his own Yes, exactly. <br /> <br /> The ROCK BOTTOM of acting .The CGI is the p eggiore than ever. I mean Stinger beats him (and boy is the baaaaad of Stinger's CGI). History makes no sense. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfactory. The only thing that could prevent you from looking is unprovoked violence and cold blood. Blood and courage are done well enough. Because, you can actually see that the film was born there and then went on. (Example: Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a rag cat - fake as it may be - and swallows it ... and then eats what has fallen.) Because we never know. We know, however, that this cat must have been on illegal substances, since its heart is almost half its size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment, that this film is so bad that it is good, but it's just bad. Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points. I added one for the blood.
