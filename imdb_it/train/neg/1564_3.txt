... That was how I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how awful this movie was. I barely made twenty minutes before I started thinking about myself, "Wow, this is pretty bad." And to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it hadn't been for Esai Morales (even though he had very little time on screen). It's the only well-played role in the film, and it's a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. <br /> <br /> As I watched this I started thinking about his role in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it wasn't as good as I thought. Problem: his prison / hard action seems to be just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was making a bad impression. Have you ever met someone who talks about how your character was SUPPORTED to? I doubt it, but maybe it should have. <br /> <br /> And, to make matters worse, they managed to inject a little prison philosophy and make it seem fictitious to say the least, especially considering that the rhetoric was launched by a "rasta" whose accent so strong it seems unnatural. <br /> <br /> Normally, don't beat a movie like this, but when I saw the movie it had a decent review. I felt like I had been deceived and lied, and I thought I should try to save someone from the misery of having to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
