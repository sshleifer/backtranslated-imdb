This is a rigorous review of the pilot episode as it appears on DVD. <br /> <br /> Television came out of my life in 1981, so I never followed the series or part of it - which means I'm immune to the nostalgic charm that Moonlighting seems to have for most reviewers. <br /> <br /> (Possible warning spoiler) <br /> <br /> The pilot of Moonlighting is your basic yarn "caveman meets fluffball", where a "charming" man of red blood manipulates a woman misled in accomplishing what he wants and needs. The premises on which the "spirit" of the script is based must already have appeared stale around 1950. It also contains some frankly bad writings, as in the scene where Maddie demolishes the furniture instead of shooting the villain, strictly to prove himself inept woman in need of male assistance. <br /> <br /> I often hear that Susan Faludi overreacts in seeing the male chauvinist conspiracy in simple entertainment, but in this particular case I'm all with her - Moonlighting has BACKLASH printed on it. <br /> <br /> In a sense, however, this DVD is a must for all Bruce Willis fans: in addition to the pilot episode, it contains the screen test that brought Willis the job. Both features show how far Willis's acting ability developed between 1985 and 1988/89 (Die Hard 1, In Country). Impressive! <br /> <br /> Vote (and I _am_ a Bruce Willis fan): 2 out of 10
