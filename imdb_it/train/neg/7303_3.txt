Cabin Fever is the first feature film directed by Eli Roth. Roth and Randy Pearlstein wrote the screenplay for a story by Roth. This is a zombie movie, which owes a lot to George Romero and his previous "living dead films", and to the film the original Texas Chainsaw Massacrenot to mention "Evil Dead "by Sam Ramie. There is nothing original here, and the story is not compelling. Acting is in line with this genre, it's just that the story fails. and he did better. he said that, after getting a commercial, if not artistic, success from this movie, Roth decided to be a director and came out with the abysmally atrocious, mean witty, useless (albeit much more ambitious ) Hostel. should have stopped while he was behind.Cabin Fever is not a good movie, however compared to Hostel is a work of art. I hope that someone (preferably a psychiatrist) convinces this guy that film production is the wrong career choice. Cabin fever, a weak 3/10 for not being small aby as a hostel.
