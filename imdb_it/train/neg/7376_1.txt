Steven, what you did, you've reached a new low. It's strange since Steven's latest film was directed by the same director who made this junk. Shadow man was devilishly evil so badly that it wasn't even funny that Steven is barely in the movie and feels like he's in a cameo and when he's in the movie he's still dubbed half the time. As for action, let's just say that the wizard of oz had more action than this junk, there's almost no action in the movie and when it finally arrives it's boring depressing depressing shot at the so-called action scenes. Seagal barely kills anyone unlike his films where he goes into a man's army, ie under siege 1 and 2 and wounds come out. the plot is so confused with so many holes in the plot that sometimes it doesn't make the scenes. flight of fury better to be good than pity I wasted 5 pounds in this garbage 0 out of ten best luck next time
