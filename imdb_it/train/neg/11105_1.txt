It didn't make sense and it was so terrible ... I think Hollywood has a lot of movies like that ... you don't have to watch it. people who cut or eat something I should say ... it hurt me! My God! movie about people we don't know but who feed on Humans! they have teeth bla bla bla ... isn't it familiar? I can bet you, you saw it in another movie. the cast was fantastic but I think the scenery was really terrible. and I should say that Bradley Cooper was really great ... he's so talented ... I actually said horrible, but I think because of horrible scenes ... let me explain. have you ever eaten your tongue but in the film a person did it! it was really horrible ... however I think the film would have been so beautiful without that terrible human eater or sharp scenes ...
