One of the worst movies I've ever had the regret of sitting, Killer Tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Brain Damage and Pulp Fiction. Designed primarily to offend, apparently, but so inane that only the most fireproof conservatives would be taken from it.
