How did this piece of shit stay on TV for so long? It's terrible. It makes me want to shoot someone. It's so fake that it's actually worse than a science fiction movie from the 1940s. I'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. I remember watching it when it came out. I thought, hey this might be interesting, then I discovered how utterly, insanely, ridiculously stupid he was. It was so bad that I actually pulled out my pocket knife and put my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> Please, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they are the garbage that is blocking networks and canceling quality programming that requires reflection to create.
