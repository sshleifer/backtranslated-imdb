I can't help but I like movies that are meant to be scary and are just bad. I have personally listed it in my top 10 worst films right under the abyss creatures! Watch this movie and have a good laugh, don't expect to see academic awards for acting. More possibilities to understand the film itself. In all honesty even though I've seen a lot worse than that. Also, some maniacs who roam the desert wiping the same people who just died are unbelievably original. I think it's one of those movies of love or hate. you can invent your mind, it's terrible, but somehow it pulls it out, that's why I love it
