Alone In The Dark is a BAD movie and linked to Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish it was EVERYTHING I had to say, but obviously the IMDb stipulates a word count and all the rest. <br /> <br /> There are two of them thinking about what kind of bad film is a worse kind of bad film. A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies or this braggart. See films like Monster A Go Go and Manos, because the director has no idea. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid idiot who grabs money and simply doesn't care about his audience. <br /> <br /> It's more shocking when you think Uwe Boll (the mind behind this shocking shit and already has a real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The horror film really terribly bad. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, casual random crowds and soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a terrible film that should never be seen by anyone. Woo hoo! Review Give me a present, let's introduce you to 2006 and maybe I won't talk about it anymore. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
