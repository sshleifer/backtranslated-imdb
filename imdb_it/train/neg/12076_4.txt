You all know the story of "Hamlet". I want it. <br /> <br /> Well, the phrase "To be or not to be" was beaten on the ground so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact, it was not so nice to start with). In FACT, I find "Hamlet" a good game but largely overrated. It's not even the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not too far behind. "Macbeth (knocks on the table, from his drawers, the record will make amends, OW!)" It's not so bad. There are many others who are better than this Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not comment much on the film, but I will analyze the absolutely horrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Ok. . . Mike and the Bots win a card game, they choose the movie. . . ask "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and prepare for the most boring science-fiction episode of MST3K ever (I have to admit that I haven't seen any of the CCs). <br /> <br /> While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes the vision of that episode horrible, since it is not a movie, rather than random and joint scenes (I am reminded of Mike's phrase from "Future War": "Perhaps this is an anthology of short films and without plot", the SOL Crew a lot has achieved many good slots. I can't say the same for this. <br /> <br /> Riffs fall flat, host segments (as usual) are mediocre at best, and when the movie itself (which is not so bad) is actually BETTER (I mean, like quality films, not like the field, like "Prince of Space" of the MST3K version, you know the show must be bad. I laughed (the last time I saw him was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times. I tried and tried and TRIED to be entertained - but I couldn't. Only the occasional line, like "Head of Queen Dilbert!" (and when this is the funniest part of the episode, well, ahem) - and from time to time, I mean every ten minutes or so - maybe even giggles at me. The second time I tried watching it, I didn't even laugh at the few jokes I'd found funny before, and I simply gave up forty minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> The film is not horrible; it's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are pretty good, and even if dubbing isn't the best, it's not a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; TRE, yes TRE for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY BECAUSE, MST3K!
