First of all I have to admit Batman: the animated series is by far the best batman series. We watched it when it was on TV. I didn't realize there was a fourth season. It really wasn't there. BTAS ends with season 3, and should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Because they had to mess with a good thing. The Catwoman and Poison ivy now has terrible gray faces. The Joker seems beyond fears, it seems that every time they revisit its appearance it seems more and more disturbing. It seems that it no longer has pupils, and now it doesn't seem remotely human (even if it is). <br /> <br /> Bruce Wayne is voiced by Kevin Conroy who makes the best batman. Even if he now looks like a superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. <br /> <br /> Night Wing really needs a haircut, please! Alfred has only pupils out of his eyes, he looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I saw three episodes of the disc 1 of the series and I noticed that this version is more violent and graphic (there is blood each episode). <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Batman: the animated series, there is no batman season 4. They have just included this series as season 4 for marketability. If they just published it as The New Batman Adventures, I don't think many people would have bought it. <br /> <br /> Save yourself the disappointment and keep the seasons 1-3.
