This movie is terrible. I couldn't wait to do it, because I thought "Lantana" was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The following review may contain * spoiler * <br /> <br /> ***** <br /> <br /> First of all, the good things: it looks great, some of the performances I'm ok. Bad things are everything else. <br /> <br /> The story, as you may know, speaks of some guys who go fishing and discover a body, with the twist they find on Friday but continue to fish and finally report it on Sunday when they return to the mobile range (mobile phone). However the film takes its time (boy it takes time) to get to this central event. <br /> <br /> Of the group of characters (about a dozen), nobody seems to like another (which is, I suppose, coherently, because they are all unlikely). I was extremely frustrated by the inability to adequately explain how the characters are connected, and it was only towards the end of the film that I could vaguely build the family tree. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to think of a film that seems inexorably gloomy, which is a failure in the structure of the story, since the character's lives seem just as bad before the fishing trip as it was after. Once you've set the bar so high, it's hard to get up unless everyone commits suicide. <br /> <br /> There are silly falls in logic. The killer throws the body into the lake and then somehow walks away towards the mountains. The fishermen leave on Sunday morning, but for some reason Byrne returns home late at night after his wife has gone to bed. Then the first thing the next morning the policemen slam the door to get him down to the station. Haven't heard of the phone? Down at the station, does the media know the whole story, less than 24 hours after reporting on the body? <br /> <br /> The debate that the kids definitely had after finding the body is completely missing from the plot. This is a mystery - everyone asks him "how could you do it?" and the public is asking the same question. (The debate on what to do with the body is the key scene in "Deliverance"). I know exactly what I would do in their situation. Someone has to get out of the car, drive to the mobile camp, call the cops, wait and guide them to the position. If others wait at the camp and fish, who cares? <br /> <br /> Much of this all seems false. The only thing that was true was that, being the black girl, the local aborigines had realized the actions of the fishermen as racist, "they wouldn't have done it if she had been a white girl". <br /> <br /> In all there is a curious indifference to those who may have killed the girl (I think the subject is mentioned once), and there is no mystery, since the public sees the killer in the opening scene. /> <br /> So I'm sitting there bored and confused at the same time, when there's a turning point - not in the plot, but in the theme. All of a sudden this is the silent dignity of the grieving aborigines that lead to a ridiculous ending with some inconsistent things about the reconciliation between black and white. Eh? <br /> <br /> This is the Australian film "at its best", according to The Age.
