I had the (dis) luck of seeing this film in a projection in the United States. Having reluctantly sat through the whole abyssal thing, I'm shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB. <br /> <br /> The original film was a turkey, but interesting. It was inserted in that early seventies, after the 1969 revolution; this movie only stinks of ......., well, nothing really. It's so ugly. <br /> <br /> Imagine a poorly made perfume advertisement - do you understand what I mean? <br /> <br /> Madonna has never been able to act, and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years. It always looks worse all these years, becoming more like a skin meerkat. <br /> <br /> Guy Ritchie, who built his "reputation" on Lock Stock, has never directed either - his films are shallow parades, badly cut. Here too it does not disappoint; wisely chose his wife as the protagonist of this debacle. <br /> <br /> Please pay little attention to the good reviews this film has received from other posters below. They are obviously commercial installations. <br /> <br /> Do not encourage Ritchie to humiliate herself further by giving him money. <br /> <br />
