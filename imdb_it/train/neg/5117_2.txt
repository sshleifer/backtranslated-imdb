I want to clarify first of all that I am a Christian (and that I work in the film and television sector), so I understand what it means to work on a feature film, so propose to filmmakers about it. They are all for positive and edifying messages if they are faithful to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things do not always work ... even for the followers of Christ). I am glad that others have such extraordinarily positive reactions to the clear Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on his face. A film lives and dies in its history and here you have one-dimensional stereotypes, an exhibition in abundance and spontaneous changes in the behavior of the characters that are inexplicably to say the least. I think a movie shouldn't hit your head with your message to get to the point. I'm sure the Kendrick brothers. will improve over time and also their storytelling methods. Maybe they could direct someone else's script as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not exactly my first love, but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc.). It can inspire in many ways. If you are interested in an inspirational PG-rated film, take a look at Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill". The whole truth is the truth of God ...
