Of course, "Flatley" isn't exactly the ideal name for a dancer yet, but I think Michael is really pushing the irony envelope with this new title: "Feet of Flames" <br /> <br /> You can't really resist recommending Desenex Foot Spray at Flatley's (and clearly suffering) withdrawal. <br /> <br /> I could add that, just like that cheering cheering of London (for review below), I too am thrilled to be his last live performance. <br /> <br /> "I mention that it could be his last live performance, Flatley is cheered by an enthusiastic London audience." ~ Perry Seibert, All Movie Guide
