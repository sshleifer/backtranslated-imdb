This is meant to be a comedy, but above all a bad taste, and nothing that can remotely cause a smile in the film. The film is about a couple trying for a child, and those people in real life who are in that situation will be amazed by the representations depicted. For example, scenes in a fertility clinic are not at all funny and are frankly embarrassing. The male protagonist who plays a construction worker and in his hard hat looks like an excuse for a rejection from Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than her. Both derivations appear unpleasant, unattractive and absolutely unconvincing. There are various ridiculous free and absolutely unassuming scenes in the film, for example with a low-cost airline, which is devoid of humor. The only reason I gave this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a sign for Shirley Maclaine, which is a class above all else in the picture, and a mark for a half-century music (even old).
