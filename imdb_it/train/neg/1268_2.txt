Oh what a patronizing movie! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the POV of Hollywood directors' universe, this film seeks to be a profound social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. <br /> <br /> Stereotyped and slim personalities with very different socio-economic backgrounds intersect in their everyday, banal lives. The plot is separate and occasional. Numerous plot devices do not enthuse the film, such as: a shot in the car, an abandoned child left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a boy flying in the night sky over the city, a child at the summer camp. <br /> <br /> And through all these events, the only constant is the generous help of the sociological "intuitions" imparted through dialogue, as the characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character tells another: "When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we are, ... those rocks are laughing at me, I could say, me and my concerns; true humorous for that Grand Canyon ". <br /> <br /> And another character who pontificates about the meaning of all this: "There is an abyss in this country, an ever-widening chasm between the people who have stuff and the people who wear Ho ... Ã¨ as if this great hole had opened in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what came out ... is an eruption of anger, and anger creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, apart from the superficial and thin characters, apart from the stupid plot, the rhythm of the story is tremendously slow. Acting is trivial and superficial. The tone of the film is pleased and satisfied with itself, in contempt of the screenplay for the spectators. <br /> <br /> This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who imagine themselves as almighty gurus, looking from above. They think their film will be a surprising revelation for us, humble filmmakers who are not aware of it, eager to know the true meaning of American social change.
