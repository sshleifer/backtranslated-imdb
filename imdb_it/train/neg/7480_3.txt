We all know what happens when we have a bad day at the office, right? Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it looks like when you have the worst of every day trying to get to the office. Sometimes, it's not worth going, do you know what I mean? And sometimes, it's not worth doing something when it's been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis ... and even better. <br /> <br /> It is not that Steve Martin is a bad comedian or wrong for the role of worried and stressed advertising manager; on the contrary, on both fronts. And it's not like Goldie Hawn is equally inept; his work has always been good, if not exceptional, since I first saw it on TV Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is that it is not the unfortunate couple at all: is it really New York and why should everyone come to New York to live and love their lives far away in marital happiness? ? a type of ?? in the largest city in the world. Here, if you are New Yorker ... <br /> <br /> Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that has realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and it includes the most part of the situations and the gags of sight you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. This 1999 version unfortunately results in free bribes specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see the excess. For example, not satisfied with being the star of the main actors, there is a cameo (relatively long too) by Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know. What ?? Is Giuliani doing the president's hole even then? Worse ?? a walking advertising for the kinder face of New York. <br /> <br /> And then we have John Cleese, who resumes his role as Basil Fawlty ?? but this time, as a sarcasm transvestite also ?? again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally makes itself look like the idiot it is, in this role. And, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers, probably the best British comic series, to exclude anyone ... <br /> <br /> Why was this 1999 film made? In the 1970s, New York was a city that was dying, in many ways. It was almost literally bankrupt. So, when it was created in 1970, it was the city you saw: dark, dark, moody, disturbing and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Great Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all). In 1999, things had improved: the glitz was back, New York was flourishing, it was the Big Apple, ready to make you bite, if you had the moxie ... <br /> <br /> So, of course, the couple in this second coming finds that moxie within itself and finally joins the fabulous scrum to continue the American dream of life, freedom and the pursuit of happiness. So this film is really comical, but not for reasons that the producers may have expected. As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in the comedy, this film is a disguise of the very best one made with the great Jack Lemmon. If you've seen the latter, then definitely don't worry about it.
