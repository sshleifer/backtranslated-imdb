My wife and I found this film extremely unsatisfactory. While the plot keeps you interested and busy asking me what's going on, when you leave the theater, there are too many things to lose that don't make any sense. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, a hugely wealthy head of a New York bank has a terrible hidden secret. Taking advantage of the Second World War with the Nazis and hiding the stolen loot from the Jews, he keeps the evidence (including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he wants this to never be revealed, why didn't he burn and destroy documents years ago? And the diamonds? Obviously, he doesn't need them - why keep them instead of eliminating them? How did the robbers discover his secret? How did they know about this safety box n. 232? The axis detective Denzel Washington also discovers that the bank documents show SD Boxes No 231 and 233, but no # 232. Curious. He meticulously found the time somehow to make a grueling search for bank documents to bring this curious fact to light. All the while it is a hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start running them momentarily. Wow! Talk about super powers for a detective. <br /> <br /> The bank thieves leave millions of dollars in free currency behind in the vault they opened. They take only the contents of the SD Box # 232, apparently for the purpose of blackmailing the president of the bank. This escapes any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film describes as a criminal mind, or for its henchmen with a minor brain. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, using his political connections with the mayor of New York, gets permission to enter the bank that is under the control of bank thieves while holding many hostages. He offers the robber leader an agreement to repurchase the documents he now holds, but he does not care. So what is its point (if it exists?). <br /> <br /> My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players, Christopher Plummer (president of the bank), Denzel Washington (ace detective) and Jodie Foster, cracker shooter problems for high power . <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Flight Plan", was also full of holes that made no sense. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I'll probably avoid his future films. <br /> <br /> Now my problem is that I rarely get my wife to go to the movies. I cannot disagree with you about this ... "A REFUSAL OF MONEY AND A TIME-LOSS". Be warned A well made film, excellent actors, a bad script.
