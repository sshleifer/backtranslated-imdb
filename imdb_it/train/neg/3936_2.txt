Wow. I thought it might be tasteless but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car-crash" movie: those that are so bad you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can be. This is really the only reason I can leave television - morbid fascination. It was not so much the acting, which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot that should never have seen the light of day. Even the script is indescribable. As for the cinematography, did anyone else notice that it used a "curtain design" device, as in an old television program of the 50s ... but without irony? At first I thought they were joking but the film takes itself too seriously for using it in an ironic way. Don't even ask me for the score ... the only high point is the final song, by Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people something for their $ 8 ... glad to have seen it on TV !!!!! Simply stupid! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton had trouble finding a lot of work recently? I imagine that if you don't expect a lot and want to watch a mindless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening cutting toenails, which is why it deserves a 2.
