Now, what's wrong with the actors who took part in that shit? Michael Dorn should stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember Miami Vice? I loved it there ... Well, whatever - what can you expect from a movie with one of Baywatch's lifeguards on your head? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters is even nice, the special effects are hilarious (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic to what is happening. I had the feeling that the directors were trying a kind of "Attack of the killer tomatoes". Especially in the scene where all the important people discussed national security in a kind of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see it on TV, change channels - your TV will always be grateful.
