I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical touch (since this film was advertised) but this failed me miserably. For me, the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I quickly lost interest. I'm very sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved in this movie. I will remain a fan of all of them, but only time can cure my feeling about this. The only thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played the character of Yonica so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; it took me some scenes to understand that it was her. Fortunately I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box; if I had paid to see it on the big screen, I'd be really maddening !!
