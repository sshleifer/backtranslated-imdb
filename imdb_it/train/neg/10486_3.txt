My main comment on this film is how did Zwick get credible actors to work on this film? Impressive cast ?? even for supporting characters, none of which really helps this movie. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo was almost worth it ?? what was Tom? Lost a bet? The best cameo in the film was Joe Isuzu, by far a classic! The premise is good. The character of Basinger, struggling with the existence of Pink Lady, is making its way to the motel in Las Vegas, a motel that launches the glorious cosmetic sales pyramid. This happens when Corbett's character is traveling to Las Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his future ex-wife motivated by ??. What else? Extortion. As they both head for them, they have numerous clashes with Elvis impersonators who went to an Elvis convention impersonating Las Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and starts following what they think is an Elvis serial killer. Unfortunately, premise does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When you watch this film, do you imagine being back in first grade ?? when narrative lines and continuity are not really important. It's much more fun to look at Basinger beautifully on his Pink Lady outfit than to wonder why what he's doing doesn't make much sense. The film strives, but in the end it falls very soon. In the end, it is full of ideas that could have been theoretically fun, but in practice they were not so funny. <br /> <br /> Not the worst, but could you find yourself leaving the building while you watch this one ???? Don't say I didn't warn you!
