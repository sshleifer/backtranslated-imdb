90 minutes of Mindy ... Mindy is a provocation for her boyfriend Bill ... Mindy dances at high school dance ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, steals a loaf of "shepherd's bread", Mindy is almost raped . Ah, the pleasures of Crown International's drive-in capabilities. It must be remembered that these films were never designed to be watched from the beginning to the end on DVD players. They were made in 90 minutes of atmosphere, so the boys of the 70s would have had a soundtrack like they did with their Pintos and Citations. The lack of rhythm and structure didn't matter to the original audience - they probably only tuned themselves when the T&A on the screen matched what they were doing, out in the parking lot. The film is really irritating when viewed as a story. It's much more fun to talk about it than to watch it. My favorite habits: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or change of underwear, spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being abducted and almost raped by depraved motorcyclists, and after their innocent friend "Pan" was savagely beaten, Mindy and his girlfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy lights up immediately and chirps "I'm going" to Big Sur !! "But again, talking or reading is much more fun than sitting.
