Here is one of those films spoiled by the studio's insistence for a happy ending. Conflicts that have lasted for years are resolved in a few minutes. It would have been much more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is destroyed by a sudden metamorphosis from an independent and assertive woman to a complacent woman of the type who has set aside for life. Brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young who plays a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and then who appears, but Gig Young, the actor! It is worth seeing even if far below what could have been.
