A terrible movie! It must have been against some real skunks to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They took the story of the first famous painter of the female Renaissance and destroyed it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they took liberties with the facts; if the story was good, it would be perfect. But it's simply bizarre - by all accounts the true story of this artist would have produced a much better film, so why did they invent this boring script? I suppose there were not enough naked people in the actual version. In the end he was rushed, with a summary of the artist's life - we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they had favored the rest of the film with the same brevity.
