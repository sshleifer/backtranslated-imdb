I don't know what they thought. For their part, I want to say that someone is even remotely connected to this disaster. I've seen such bad movies, I've seen such bad movies, and then there's this. But I will say one thing, anyone who wrote that the script was managed to put on screen what could be the most absurd written dialogue. There is nothing good in this film, both from a technical point of view and from any other point of view. This allowed it to be done and then it should have been fired immediately. There are some fairly well-known names in this film. In reality he hesitates to use the word movie.it as a collection of random scenes that have no relation to another and make less than 0., I can't understand why someone with a certain dignity can appear in this one. I got really cheap, and I still got torn. Even if I got this movie for free, I would still have been robbed. This is an absolute 0/10
