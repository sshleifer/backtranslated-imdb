Don't waste time or money on this movie. My roommate rented it because he thought it was the other movie called Descent (the movie about some travelers trapped in a cave). so, we decided to watch it anyway thinking it couldn't be that bad. Was. I can't believe this movie was actually produced and released to the public. It was so horrible that it almost looked like an accident scene where you wanted to look away, but you can't make yourself. I honestly feel emotionally marked. He switched from a semi-low budget film in which a college girl is attacked by a guy who comes out with a porn movie. And really not good. I went from hating the woman rapist to feeling almost sick for him. Almost. All in all, a terrible film that was definitely ranked NC-17 for a reason. Don't waste your money. And don't let your kids look at it.
