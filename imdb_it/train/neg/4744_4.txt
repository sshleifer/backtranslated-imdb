The worst DCOM I've seen. Never. Well, maybe not as bad as Smart House. This was just bad. The acting and the story went well, but the effects KILLED! <br /> <br /> They were so fake! The only good fighting scene was between his brother and Shen. This was probably the only scene where I was excited. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found this film very boring and the film ended suddenly. <br /> <br /> I will give him a four for Brenda Song who is a very funny actress and a fighting scene. <br /> <br /> 4/10
