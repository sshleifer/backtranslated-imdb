I'll say so much - This director is all based on RAW images ... things that many of us are not ready to confront head-on. Images of sex, suicide, murder and people who "free themselves" are constantly bombarding the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release. Although I don't think I could ever see this movie again, I will say that the director has a good eye. There were some really beautiful shots and "moments of image" in the film (the fans, the wire in my hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly when they let us ask " what the heck did we just see? "). <br /> <br /> Note: if you have a tendency to vomit or vomit easily ... don't see this movie.
