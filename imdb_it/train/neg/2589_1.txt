For those with little time available, I will quickly summarize, in a word ... pathetic. There are many good examples of why this movie fits perfectly under that description. So much so that you can barely spend 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and useless forced on you. Do you want a woman completely naked in the first 10 minutes? You got it right! The reason it appears is so useless, even if it really is the tone for the rest of this piece of youthful shit. You can almost take a look at the disappointed minds of 12-year-old kids who wrote this piece of trash just by looking at this shit they expect the public to actually pay for !! ?? !!! <br /> <br /> I've seen many movie franchise deaths over the years, but American Pie, Beta House must be one of the worst offenders when you consider that, despite the average nature of the original film, it's still a thousand times more fun of this dreck. <br /> <br /> The plot is predictable and sometimes you really feel like you're watching a school play. The things that happen in this movie are so unrealistic that it takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to actually see it (we're talking about Star Wars suspension levels, like the kind you need to convince yourself that Jar Jar is real) <br /> <br /> The plot is very thin and mostly the events that show up are there just to show another pair of breasts or create another pathetic joke. There is no acting talent to talk about, all you get are a lot of nice guys trying to make us laugh. And ohhh how they fail !!!! Every line falls flat and the only thing I laughed about is how socially unaware they seem to be the scriptwriters. How else can you explain bulls ** t try to pass off as a story? <br /> <br /> They spend every opportunity to do something useful and fun in favor of low common denominator nonsense. Characters must complete a number of tasks before they are accepted as members of Beta House, but this is mainly dealt with by a series of very short editing which implies that they are completing tasks but we see few or no evidence of this actually happening. It's a very lazy way to tell a story. There is also no opportunity to be fun doing it. (Imagine saying the Wizard of Oz where all the important events happened off the screen instead of on it, and all we see is Dorothy who shoots down the Scarecrow from time to time and says "Damn that it certainly was a great adventure which we had just had then ") lazy. Lazy. WOLF !!!! <br /> <br /> Female characters have little or nothing to say. All they do is remain naked for no apparent reason and are used as visual objects through most of the film. Braindeads who only look for T & A will not be disappointed, but only for this reason be ashamed. If you buy it on DVD, you will contribute to the fall of the company in your special way. Congratulations.
