This "Debuted" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I am speech" I recorded it today to be able to see it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I'm tearing the closets to pieces looking for a long rope so I can hang myself. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like "It was fun making fun of this movie" but this movie doesn't give me anything to work on. I know you shouldn't post spoilers here without warning, but I'll do it anyway "This movie sucks" There I said it! They should show this film to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine-year-old granddaughter could make a better film. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and / or the soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old toolbox. I put it on the thumb of my left hand and squeeze it until the pain clears the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could simply record on this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit. I could wash myself with soap but I'm afraid I'll never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
