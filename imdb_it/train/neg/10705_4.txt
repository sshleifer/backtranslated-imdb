Unconventional policeman with family problems and passion for using his gun? Check! Isolated position with valuable object that asks to be stolen ?? Check! Interesting love interest? Check! Assorted gang of cardboard fodder criminals of stupid guns with disreputable European accents ?? Check! Bad German sound played by an English actor with a piece of banal dialogues for every occasion? Check! Corny one liner ?? Check it out! <br /> <br /> Deary me, does this movie pee or what? The clichés are as dense and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just look at how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a brazenly cheap and cheerful way for the video rejection of Die Hard only set on a mountain (complete with some dashed lines compared to the above) we have all the usual movements of action that the clichés come progressively eliminated as we proceed with some good old violence and nudity launched to awaken anyone in the public that could only have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is the full cop on John McClane's mode, who even manages to manage the time when the old villain with the gun used all his bullets at some point. <br /> <In the midst of this mess, there are some well-known recognizable faces that I can only consider necessary money and / or I was just playing it to laugh right from the useless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot of all the final implausible conclusion complete with the ropey dialogue and even the most complete effect cts. <br /> <br /> Looking at these three quid from the supermarket deal bin deal on IMDb I'm amazed to find that this dud generated not one but two sequels, I got to find these gems on DVD! It seems that the first sequel is a rip-off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, he knows it well! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor who plays Jack changes with every movie and even the name of the character seems to change for the third installment. <br /> <br /> Again, blind purchases of cheap DVDs would not be the same if the studios did not keep on trotting material of this terrible quality !!
