This very low budget comedy capers movie only manages to be low budget. The dialogue is incredibly stupid, the chase scenes are uniformly boring and most of the money on the screen seems to have been saved for a series of accidents and explosions in a parking lot during the last five minutes of the film (a brief intuition port-a- potty at the beginning of this scene is certain to ruin and throw up crap on the head of the bad movie - no object is here without a purpose). The entire film remembers in a depressing way those who occasionally came out of Rodger Corman's studio when he gave a director a few dollars and a camera for a director, but without the discipline that Corman would have imposed.
