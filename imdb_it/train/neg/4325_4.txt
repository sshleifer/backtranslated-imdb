The second in the Vacation series is easily the least pleasant, as Clark Griswold wins a trip for the whole family in Europe. <br /> <br /> The tasteless humor, which worked so well the first time, is practically non-existent here. That blame certainly falls on director Hackerling, who is obviously not at all a good director like Harold Ramis and a really uninteresting script that has only a handful of decent lines scattered around. <br /> <br /> The cast does what it can; Chevy Chase injects some life into the process but it's simply not enough and the very funny Eric Idle is completely wasted in a small role of a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments do not take place to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly aggravated. All representations of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like the way the English are educated SOOO). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, there is almost no laughter in sight and the ending turns into this one in complete slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like me) the movie is watchable, but no more.
