It has a great name, but it is so and you don't get more than that for your money, in fact the first 30-40 minutes of the movie you might find it a bit funny, but then the story goes from one side to the other with no reason particular and you don't understand what's going on until the action is over. <br /> <br /> Yet the producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I don't think the way he does it could be called nothing but exaggerating !! .... period. The kid who plays his son has absolutely no sense of acting and I think it was just a favor or something because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason while casting, they thought that by running off comedians they could make it, but they didn't! and sometimes the poor and tasteless humor is so bad, I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> But we hope this is so terrible. In order for people to accept those DVDs for the tasteful audience, they will have to offer something to eat, which could work. <br /> <br /> Maka
