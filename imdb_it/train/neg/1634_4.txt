START SPOILER: Fitfully fun and memorable for the literally hot scene of Mr. Chong: Chong coldly fries a stray kitchen cockroach in the pipe bowl, lights up, coughs violently for an apparent eternity, then with perfect ease and without skipping a beat, reloads the bowl correctly again, re-lights, re-guides. FINE SPOILER. Alas, I started to lose confidence in less than half of the proceedings. It occurred to me that the misfit duo is very unpleasant and less than recognizable. I have come to appreciate the relative refinement of contemporary stoners, Harold and Kumar. I simply prefer a brighter company. Still, the film is probably perfect for the baked brothers or those spectators who are so weak-minded to be overtaken by a bully when they - the former are sober. Remarkable aspect of Paul Reubens that emits obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.
