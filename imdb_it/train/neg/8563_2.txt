It is as the title of this thread says. The only impression I got from that movie is that the character of Marlee Matlin was always angry, so cynical and so pathetic. His character's first date with the character of William Hurt they were dancing was stupid. All in all, I tried to finish watching the movie four times, and of all four times I fell asleep. I will continue to watch that movie with one intention ... to defeat my problem with insomnia, because all I do is put myself to sleep. Sweet dreams.
