It's not even worth watching this sticky spoiler ruin everything about 'Annie'. The characters seem almost devalued by the badly written plot and have a low quality feeling with respect to the production. It was created very clearly for the TV, but if I found it on my TV, I would have moved it straight. The children in the film do a good job, yet the acting of the adults is incredible and therefore the film fails to really involve you. This film lacked the music / dance numbers that made the original brilliant and really takes Annie's shine. all the love. Johnson, since Annie is sometimes annoying and acted more ... you can't convince yourself that you're really Annie. The differences in the character's appearance continued to irritate me throughout the film. Sad to say that this sequel was a total flop.
