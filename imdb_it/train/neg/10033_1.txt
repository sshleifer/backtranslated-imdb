I was very sorry about this move. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was indifferent, the action exaggerated, the songs without tracks. Even the plot was weightless. From a writer who wrote successful scripts like Guru and Dhoom, I had high expectations. The actors worked too hard and did not help the film at all. Obviously, Kareena darkened the screen in a bikini but for two seconds. I think the stunt directors in Hindi should look at how action movies are made. They tend to exaggerate too much. In Chinese films, this style works because it is their distinctive piece. But the signature of Hindi cinema are the songs. A good action movie should not last more than two hours and it may not seem unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure these action films will become much sharper. Also note: comedy and action movies do not mix if not performed correctly. Good luck next time.
