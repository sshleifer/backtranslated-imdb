This film takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry up. They go to stay with his Nan and his uncle. The uncle discovered a 2000 year old witch kept in peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. It cannot be killed by convention, (the more it is worth it). Nora, however, has a way to do it. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror film that was made cheap. It's a messy mess. I have to ask why someone would like to make such a bad movie. I'm tempted to learn sorcery to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS
