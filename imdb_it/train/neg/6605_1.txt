Designed only to annoy (or entertain) any self-respecting intelligent person. If the director's intention had been for the viewer to detest the title character, then it would have been ok, but I know there is no Hollywood director who would criticize the pro-Marxist movement of the 1960s in America, especially not a director from the 70s. Here is a dialogue so idiotic that I sometimes wondered if I wasn't watching a play. Wouldn't you blame if you think this is a satire ?? this is how the film appears naive. Spacek has been in his left hand side of the film that leads me to the obvious and inevitable conclusion that the red boy is one of those stupid Hollywood liberals. But, I mean, aren't they all? Nice tits, but s ** t for the brain.
