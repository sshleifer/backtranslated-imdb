The first look on the cover of this photo looks like a good rock n roll movie. But don't let the cover fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The plot is simply horrible, as is acting. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a roadie movie, it's just a subtle love story, so terrible that you see it right through it. The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it weren't for the music, it would have been 0 out of 10. Meat Loaf is a horrible actor (at least it was in 1980), and the girl who plays the groupie isn't not even beautiful! This film was a huge disappointment for me, because it makes many good promises.
