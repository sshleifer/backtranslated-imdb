Amazing. This is what you would say if you were sitting in this movie. Simply, incredibly, incredible. It is actually so incredible that anyone has been stupid enough to throw the money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. That, my friends, is what really scares this film. Someone thought it was a good idea to do this. <br /> <br /> Well, here's another extraordinarily original story: the High School student (sometimes he looked like a college ??? go figure) has a whore for a mom, lives in a trailer park and is a "artist" who is ridiculed for his "being completely different". Well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and, here is the original part, his soul lives in a scarecrow (under which, he is killed by the last john of his slutty mother). Then he goes around with the standard extermination of all the people who hurt him. Awww. <br /> <br /> Here is the description: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - An incredibly funny film even if it is not what the directors obviously drunk wanted. <br /> <br /> --This is the sequel on a disc in the $ 5.00 container of Wal-Mart ?? so it's just a bit too expensive. <br /> <br /> I didn't do it wrong, Didn 't Help: <br /> <br /> - Violence and blood are sort of substandard. A person is stabbed with a cob. <br /> <br /> - It seems that they put some effort into the music, but it doesn't fit the movie perfectly and it's not that good. /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, terrible acting. <br /> <br /> - Another slasher disappointed with sexy women, none of which remove clothes. When did it stop being an eyebrow clip? <br /> <br /> - The ridiculous story. <br /> <br /> - The scarecrow spews the jokes that would make Freddy Krueger and Arnold Swartzenegger blush. <br /> <br /> - The standard basic love story doesn't go anywhere, and it's hurt. <br /> <br /> - Some of the people killed seem to have been chosen randomly ?? you never really know who anyone is and then get killed. And you only assume that they must have made it arrive. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - Extremely average slasher fare, only with a killer scarecrow instead of ?? well, everything else sucks. <br /> <br /> - It is not interesting as Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Pinhead, Chucky or even Angela of the "Sleepaway Camp" series that are all better than this atrocity. <br /> <br /> - The worst dialogue I have ever heard in my LIFE. The script is loaded with a level of delay that I never imagined could exist. Am I serious here ?? it's a complete step beyond terrible. Don't get me wrong though, is it fun to die for ?? but have I never heard more Asinine jokes ?? also in "Slumber Party Massacre III." This film makes "Jason X" Shakespeare appear. <br /> <br /> - The man who kills the boy who becomes the scarecrow: the worst wig ever. Dialogue to match <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - The one in which the elementary school youths make their witty dialogue: "Hey, let's go look for tortuous little animals. Huh huh. "<br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Trick: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (No nudity, Mom is a whore, girls don't wear bra) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, mediocre quantity) Dialogue: 0/10 (Extremely ridiculous, cheeky, exaggerated and painfully funny ?? so bad is good? My first score for dialogue in any movie!) Music: 5/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 10/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall : 3/10 <br /> <br /> Another just for people like me who like to look pure crap. Or the Slasher-film completers. This is not a good movie at all. Ridiculous dialogues and characters do not allow you to be really boring. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
