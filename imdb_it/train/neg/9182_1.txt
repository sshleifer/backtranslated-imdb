Just like everyone else has said, acting is horrible, no story or anything else, bad direction. About SFX, 360 degree shooting, matrix style, 1 shot is pretty stupid, but for every character. I mean, give me a break. And what happens with all those video game scenes, just to remind us that it's an "adaptation to video games"? Jesus, they should have fired anyone who thought of this idea. <br /> <br /> 0.00001 / 10
