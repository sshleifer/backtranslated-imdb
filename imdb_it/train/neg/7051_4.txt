A film on how to deal with problems with growth and being honest with yourself, Blue Juice is a pleasure for those who love surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film, while the most famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his friend who is drugged. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you will find that it takes a long time before the film hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time in long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. In addition, too many main characters bring a dimension to most of them. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the superficial characters you have no idea why they act in the situations in which they are inserted. <br /> <br /> Only the characters of Ewan, Sean and Catherine make this film worthy of being seen videotapes, which is why it was only released on videotape in the United States after Ewan and Catherine achieved traditional fame.
