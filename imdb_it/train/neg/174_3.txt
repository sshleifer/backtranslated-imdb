* Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> 'Return to Cabin by the Lake' is a useless film. The acting was not good and the plot was not even remotely interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin by the Lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel no. Judd Nelson was very good in the first film and put a lot more into his character than this one. He seemed not even interested in making the sequel. His acting was good but could have been better. I really don't want to comment on the rest of the cast because, in my opinion, they are not even worthy of mention. But I'll do it. The character of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the film. All of a sudden he is the center of attention next to Stanley Caldwell. The role made no sense and should have been thought a little better. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. His acting was definitely below expectations and the casting people should have been looking for someone else, anyone else. The director, Mike, was a confused character. He seemed to have a purpose for being there, but his death did not seem necessary. The acting for this role was good, nothing exceptional but better than that of Salem. <br /> <br /> The plot was really bad if you thought about it. Stanley, who is presumed dead, makes his way onto the "Cabin by the Lake" set, the film based on his script. He runs into the director and in a short time, the director is dead and Stanley is leading the show. Yes, from nothing the crew intends to let this stranger enter the scene and finish the film without knowing anything about him. There are some murders, not much, and those that are shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set is electrocuted while shooting a scene. Another character is chewed by a motorboat. And one gets tangled up in a plant before drowning. These writers must have been hard with excitement. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed by the shooting of the film. The way he continued to change from a low budget to normal started to get very annoying. Furthermore, the new cabin on the lake was badly created. We are not shown, but only in some scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It worked in the first movie just because we were shown the room much more, but it didn't work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All but a few had no reason to be there. The acting of what was shown was really bad and ... they didn't really have a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Return to Cabin by the Lake" is a collection sequel from where the first one was interrupted. 'Cabin in the Lake' I can take but this was simply not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided this and you should. It's nothing like the first one and everything went too slowly. Nothing happened in the first hour and continued to drag on for the second. Not to mention the fact that the writing was horrible. Only do this if you need help falling asleep. <br /> <br /> So, let's see that Stanley challenges death and is still alive and well. From the way he talks, it seems like there may be a possible third installment of a good movie alone. Stop launching sequels and we could be all right! <br /> <br /> (The filmmakers didn't realize that they showed us how they filmed the first lake scenes? They were all done in a tank. Never reveal the secrets of the shooting.) > <br />
