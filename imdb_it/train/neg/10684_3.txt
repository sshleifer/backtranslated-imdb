This movie was craptacular. I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the greatest antagonist of the film was, in fact, myself. I played it beautifully for everything; promising myself I would go away, but just drinking another beer hoping it would magically turn into something compelling down the road. Even in this state, I could not help but notice that the acting of Cuba was as fragile as a tracing paper. His obsessive dedication to his work was conducted unconvincingly, as was his one-night binge after the failure of his own idiotic standards. Burt came on the screen as a general, it's true, a general (wearing too many tricks). I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cuba, except mine was real and I stopped my toe. Recompense! Reward my squat finger!
