Well, let's start by saying how absolutely HILARIO is this movie, I simply couldn't help laughing at the sheer stupidity. Don't get me wrong, he is well played especially by Bassinger but the script is right, well, the mind is really amazing. <br /> <br /> The premise is good and as long as Della is not really a witness to the murder, it is engaging but then goes downhill. In the middle of the film the protagonist takes out his toolbox and, of course, instead of throwing it to the boy's head, he decides to take out a screwdriver, a jack and finally a glow (like in a sinking ship) to kill his victims respectively. <br /> <br /> Then there's the final sentence that I promise you, if it doesn't get you right then I'll eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at a good old-fashioned, scary movie making. I might even suggest you pay attention to the scene in the demolition yard with the boy falling from the foot of a wooden table, he takes me every time.
