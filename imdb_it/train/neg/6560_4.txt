"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of film. I found it overly sentimental and the acting was below average. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good but some of the other actors were not at all credible. I also didn't think Paul's parents would leave and leave him with the Dabney family, especially when they had a housekeeper who lived at home. Their social classes were too far apart to consider this credible. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. At the beginning of the film there was a scene that showed Andie MacDowell getting out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was? His son? What was the scene that had to show us? Why was the scene included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the film and in fact it was never mentioned again. It seemed free and not suited to the story. There were too many inconsistencies in the film for me. Shadrach's story was beautiful but I was not convinced that the Dabneys would be as kind and generous as they were interpreted.
