The IMDb plot summary does not in any way describe the essence of this film. He should have read: "Be ready to be catapulted into the 3rd bank prison from the back of your family's church at age 8, listening to the preacher buzzing about God's will while all you can think of is going home for your Lego '. <br /> <br /> Start well-intentioned, creating intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues like Renny's "how did my thumb cut to heal so fast?" Moment. It slowly turns into a Christian jamboree, completely sacrificing the plot in the wake of talk induced by evangelization.I think I counted the use of the word 'pray' about 53 times in an interval of five minutes towards the end. to distort the context of the word with its synonym, 'prey'. Unfortunately, my little mental game made the film at least bearable for the last 20 minutes, and it made me laugh every time a person gio said 'prayer' ('preyer' to me) when it became totally demented. In fact, even my Catholic wife has fallen into her chair with boredom, almost to the point of ending up on the floor. <br /> <br /> For all the Christian health enthusiasts who have rated this 8-10 star film, I suggest you stick with your theology - strengthening safety standards like Circle Square, The Ten Commandments, anything from Narnia , Jesus Christ Superstar and the like. Stay away from more brain-demanding topics in films like Jesus Camp, The God Who Wasn't There, What Would Jesus Buy, or the next Religulous. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Robert Whitlow's book is better.
