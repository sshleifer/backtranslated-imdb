What could have been a study of the engaging and emotionally charged character is totally compromised by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard-trained musician who dreams of playing with Walt Disney's orchestra until his attacks with schizophrenia take him to the street and eventually slip into a row. Looking for a good story to increase his flag career, journalist Steve Lopez (Robert "rehab" Downey) knows him and tells his story. Taking every element of the classic film "how we hit the skates", borrowing very freely from "A Beautiful Mind", taking the phony "feel good" attitude of films like "Rocky" - choose the number of sequels - and also whipping you all the 1930s-style melodrama, all that remains on the screen is a burned-out film envelope. It is banal, banal, absolutely predictable and too often plays on our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hate it, people will give you bad looks. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can't. The acting redeems him in some way, but not enough to give him more than a star. Strictly done for TV movie stuff. It's not worth your time.
