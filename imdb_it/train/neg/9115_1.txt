If you ask me, the first one was really better. Look at Sarah M. G., she is a real girl, cruel, cruel, look at Amy Adams who is just a little crazy girl around. She is nothing! People don't love it! Secondly, Sebastian was cute and warm in the first movie, now it's "baby face". The story is not good, and I don't understand. Because they didn't do this first, it's the beginning. Silly actors, nothing with history. This is not cruel, this is the game. The first has better actors, a better story and its meaning. I think music is better in cruel intent 1 and music is better in cruel intent. 3. It's not the worst movie I've seen, but in compaer with the first is a big, big, big nothing.
