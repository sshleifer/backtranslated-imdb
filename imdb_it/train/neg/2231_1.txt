All I can say after seeing Snitch is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear that you have no understanding of what you do film. If you insist on making gangster films, I urge you to do research. It's funny to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that sound even more absurd when they talk. <br /> <br /> I laughed at the part where Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This film was as hard as a special after-school. Who had the idea of ​​wearing hats to tell where a particular gangbanger came from? I suspect the real gangsters don't wear hats that claim the gang. It would be foolish to consider new laws that add a duration to a prison sentence if a person is related to a gang. <br /> <br /> Snitch is the worst gangbanger movie ever made.
