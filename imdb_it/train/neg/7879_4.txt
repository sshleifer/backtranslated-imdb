First of all, I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm. I read it with my ninth class, and it was fantastic. We also decided that watching the movie would be useful. The film was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and misses many of the book's main points. Skip a lot, and explain nothing in detail. If someone was watching this movie without first reading the book, it would have been confusing. The most disappointing thing in this film for me was the end. The end of the book was the most powerful and in the film they changed it! They had to be pigs and men in an alliance and a sort of "breakup" together, but instead, the film made it look like the animals would rebel against pigs. To sum up, I don't think this film captured the true meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book.
