I thought My Favorite Marziano was very boring and pulled out !! It wasn't funny at all. The audience sat throughout the film and didn't laugh at all !!! Not even the children laughed !! It's sad for a Disney movie !! I thought they could find someone better to play the Martian than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And it wasn't fun !! I thought the talking dress was really stupid !!! In the original television series the suit does not speak and moves !! I don't think they should have wasted time on this movie !! I give him two inches less !! Really a waste of time and I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
