Please don't be fooled by the cover of this movie. And if you're looking for an inexpensive horror movie to laugh: it's not that. I usually go for stupid if it's funny, but this fool was so stupid that it almost (or maybe he did) made me stupid. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film is better than a PDA, but not by much, and it is quite possible that the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 button on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never be a deterrent to seeing a horror movie, but add this incredible cast (tears), and you have a real humdinger. <br /> <br /> The story is about a guy who invites his friends to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his cooked lady in his office. Along the way they meet a woman in difficulty, who is then invited to accompany the other girls. <br /> <br /> The living room in the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a pile when one girl disappears and strange objects appear in the house. <br /> <br /> From there you (the audience) and the idiots, um, the actors, try to understand what is happening and soon begin not to trust each other. Overall, I think I made it better than it is. The main struggle with this film is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the invented plot, the bad acting and the motivations in the dark. Once again this could be forgivable, it was the least fun, but alas, it is not. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist is just a breakthrough as no one would guess it simply because if you really thought you were going back the film wouldn't make sense anyway. Please don't let this review stop you from seeing the wonders of this movie. (Woah, my nose grew eight inches).
