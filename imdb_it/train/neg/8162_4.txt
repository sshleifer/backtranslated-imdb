Your attitude in Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film. If you expect a masterpiece of horror, look elsewhere. If you like campy movies that are pretty fun to watch, you'll like it. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing a leading role Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd convey Schrage's anger perfectly during his "possessed" time. <br /> <br /> It is not a classic cinema but a fun way to kill a couple of hours with an evil ending. <br /> <br />
