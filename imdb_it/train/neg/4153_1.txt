I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were dull, the acting was terrible and if there was a plot for everything, it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember that a movie has been THIS bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and tits !! ;) Even this could not save this film from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone who was standing (or lying in this case) in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> I was practically disappointed by the overall "zombie" effect. Given that apparently in this film, the zombies are so common that they run from a couple here and there, and by chance they talk about it in a service station (one with an internal repair of the windshield but without an internal bathroom), the genre of the zombie films does not it is also a factor to the end. Even then, a cameo of a dozen zombies tearing up a girl's clothes is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> Give to vampires: Apparently all zombies are male and all vampires are females, which is fine for me. I'm not sure how vampires are out in the light of day, or why / how a vampire soldier came to stand in the middle of the street, still holding the gun with a stake in his heart, just waiting for the queen of the Vampires to hit until the end. The last segment in the old convent didn't make sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks for the other hot lesbian vampire "Do you think we did the right thing?" killing the two apparent heroes of the film, who put him at the top. <br /> <br /> Even the special effects and the acting effects were at historic lows. You could almost see the hoses that fake blood was pumped during the first floor of the zombie that was hit by the General. About the General, where did they find THIS Kenny Rogers the same way? No idea what the General was, apart from generally confused and out of place. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong desire to waste $ 3. Only my $ 0.02.
