For months before the release of this film, you saw it advertised on all types of print media, so I patiently waited for its video version to see what it was. After it was over, I had to apologize to my roommate for taking the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. Essentially it fails because it is a movie based on characters on non-redeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you can't stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue, which is both sophomic, moralistic and raw. The only slightly funny character is Eric, whose portrait of the only married member of a group of friends is dead. The final touch, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, instead inspires only the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all, I only rent if you are desperate or have a dark sense of humor.
