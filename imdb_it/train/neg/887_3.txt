After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of directors decided to come together and make a film similar to an anthology set in New York. Unlike the original film, the stories in this film sometimes seem to come and go too fast - the moment you think you are entering a story, it has ended up in too many cases. And often they start and stop and then start again - with the stories intertwined together. Consequently, there is no title indicating that a story is complete and that it is less formal in structure. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit (mostly hit), most of "New York, I Love You" was missing. Stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also much less sweet - and often quite terrible. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more like that. Now I understand, it was a good quality music but its dark tone really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the best there is the story of the young man who brought a girl in a wheelchair to the dance, the couple who talked about cheating outside a restaurant (even if this was also in the first film) and the old couple unhappy. It's all so sad because I loved the first movie so much and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they tried, but I simply didn't like it very much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and this is NOT a real problem, but I was amazed how many people smoked in the movie. For a recent film, this was unusual in our most anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (who wears a fresh fedora) who eats a hot dog ... and absolutely NOTHING more for almost ten minutes. The other presents a teenager who spends the film taking up the world - including a very unhappy couple.
