I remembered the title so well. For me, it was a film by Flora Robson with Olivier and Vivien Leigh in secondary roles. And he had Vincent Massey's voice behind his mustache. Well, Flora Robson was fantastic. His next signature, for me, would be "55 days in Beijing". The same role but with several sumptuous dresses. And the same voice. As for the Armada, it was a subtext. I like black and white movies. Was everything done in the Elisabeth age at night? It was quite difficult to understand at times. I can't say what the love interest was. Was he Spanish or was Vivien Leigh? And I don't think Elizabeth I would have been the brilliant strategist to recommend that firefighting ships be sent against the Armada. Apparently it worked for the Empire, but not for the script. This may have been more accurate historically, but Bette Davis had more engaging scripts. And I lost the light of day!
