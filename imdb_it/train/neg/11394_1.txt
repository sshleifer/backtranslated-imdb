Oh, for crying out loud, this must be the LAMEST movie I've seen throughout the year, and I'm sorry that normally the great John Cusack was involved in this stupid stupid piece of Stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what is the same message, even if on a thinner, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a hammer, and then proceeds to beat it in your psyche for the next boring hour and a half or so (and this is an hour and a half of my life I will never return, thank you very much !!). It is bad enough that the main characters in this film have the emotional maturity level of the fourteen-year-olds (actually I met the best fourteen-year-olds ...), except perhaps for Jeremy Piven, who was quite funny. Only the first 15 minutes or so of the film in which the character of Kate Beckinsale plays the annoying nonsense of a game about throwing all the sensitivity to the wind (literally) she had my best friend and I irritated beyond imagination. I told my husband that Rockstar had more intelligence and, at least, Rockstar's characters weren't half the dysfunctional ones of those idiots in this "Serendipito" mess. It is annoying to observe the protagonists who do not seem to have the slightest idea of ​​the choice of their own life, and feel that they are nothing more than puppets for the fate and whims of destiny. How laboriously. I am sure that this film will most likely be appreciated by those who would rather not engage in the chaotic confusion of making more complex life choices and then live responsibly with the consequences. After all, here is a film in which our hero and heroine live happily ever after having unleashed chaos and misery in the lives of two other people (ie their respective girlfriends), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there. <br /> <br />
