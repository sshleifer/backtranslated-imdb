Instead, go to the zoo, buy some peanuts and feed the monkeys. Monkeys are fun People with amnesia who don't say much, just sitting there with empty eyes are not that funny. <br /> <br /> Black comedy? There is not a black person in it, nor is there a funny thing in it. <br /> <br /> Walmart buys these things somehow and puts them on their dollar rack. It is labeled as Unrated. I think they brought out the topless scene. They might have taken other things too, who knows? All we know is that whatever they pulled out, it's gone. <br /> <br /> The acting seemed OK. There is a lot of unfathomable things tho. Should it be a city? Should it be a big lake? If it's so hot in the church, people are waving, why are they all wearing coats?
