Waiting to enter the theater with tickets in hand, I was expecting an interesting science fiction fantasy film that could finally fuel my passion for movies about robot technology, instead I was disappointed by every aspect of it, once again demonstrating that extraordinary special the effects can't help a boring storyline, which in my opinion was the worst in this year. Even acting in this film left me unsatisfied, Will Smith showed nothing new in this film, yet I never saw his acting change from "Men In Black", which was his only success in my opinion. He had to retire since then, not ruining his name with titles like "I, Robot" and "Men In Black 2". 4/10
