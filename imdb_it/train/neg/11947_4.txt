An interesting change from the first. there was more mystery in this film, so the first one. Even when it ends you wonder what happened who was the murderer. There are some good parts in the film, the first half starts slow and then in the last half the rhythm starts again. The whole movie is fun. The story is 22 years after the events in the first movie, Norman Bates came out of an asylum and returns to the Bates motel, but when a woman shows up claiming to be her real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins recites an aged Norman well again and the scene was excellent in the end, he threw that terribly strong spade.
