The same old old man as Che. He completely ignored the really interesting facts of the true character of Che. Sodeberg has reworked the same boring narrative as Che. The silly and seductive story of a rich Argentinian boy, so shocked by poverty, became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor, until he was assassinated by the CIA. Yes, yes, I've heard it all before, WE AND UNTRUI! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and much more explosive! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a vein of Messiah, who wanted to openly impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that in the hottest moment of the Cold War, he even begged the Soviet Union to attack in New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring it to the end of the world. He urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear attack against US cities. For the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev backed up and literally saved the world, Che was furious about the "betrayal". If the advice of Che had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. As a homicidal maniac who became a pop icon, he would have made a much more interesting film. Unbelievable that no director had the courage to show the real side of Che and his posthumous transformation of the media. What an Oscar winning film would do! I thought making independent films meant taking REAL risks and being GROUNDBRAKING! They are limited to "safe counterculture themes", "Che bello", "Wall Street villain", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than the KGB", "Christians are fanatics stupid ", etc ... to nausea. Oooh, how bold, how the mind blows. Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I wish they had real cojones and faced the oligarchy of the independent film! It would be really bold!
