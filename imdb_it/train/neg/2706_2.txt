Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. This is a good point and the issue of racism has been addressed many times in countless films. What distinguishes the Higher Learning from the pack is that it deals with the problem of racism in the most realistic and predictable way possible, oh yes, it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This film deals with this problem of racism in the way that Frankenstein faces most of the problems, it kills you repeatedly in a brutal and weak way. Most of the characters are caricatures, one-dimensional, caricatures (feminist lesbians, angry blacks), who react to situations in the most dramatic and predictable way possible. Instead of challenging the stereotypes, this film is overpopulated with them. Angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (A feminist also holds a sign that reads "Dead Men Do not Rape". See what I mean?) I don't want to give anything, but in this film if someone looks like a lonely shifty or a date rapist, they probably behave exactly like you aspects. The changes that the characters undergo seem obvious to everyone except for the people in the film. The big turning point in the plot depends on the violent neo-Nazis behaving like violent neo-Nazis. I guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this film is that it should be "gritty" and "hard", but they make the Nazis the bad guys. I agree that the Nazis are bad, but this is my point. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; we are not breaking any new ground here. The Nazis have been described as bad since the 1930s. The film does not question bold points of view or statements. It deals only with questions that we all know in a clumsy way, like the after-school one. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not exactly taking a hard position on a controversial topic. <br /> <br /> Superior learning is predictable, animated and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.
