This sad little film has little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival which was a "nostalgic" success. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove directed that revival, he rewrote the book extensively. I have the feeling that this writer also made a substantial change from the original 1925 version. I played the innocent womanizer Jimmy Smith on stage in 1974 and I thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a possibility. Even the anticipated joy of seeing "Topper" Roland Young playing "my" part was a great disappointment. Three comedy songs remain, and they are very badly done. Even the classic duet, "Tea For Two", is made like a virtual solo. The many familiar faces of this 1940 fiasco are not at all proud, and the protagonist, Anna Neagle, is embarrassed. When I feel sorry for spending a dollar, I know the film must be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and it is about making the theatrical game (the original, of course), so whoever is looking for the real "No No Nanette" could find a most recognizable version there.
