This was longer than the Ten Commandments, All Lord of the Rings and Matrix Trilogy put together. My oh My, what a nightmare. This is the largest exaggerated single of 2006. It is not a moment that is not scripted and clich√©. Musical films can be made brilliantly and bring real excitement to the viewer. Dreamgirls takes over the Chinese Water Torture, in the form of endless music montages, poor acting and bad directorial choices (Seriously, Mr. Condon, did you have to do the old billboard countdown? Look increase in the rankings and here is the Billboard warning that passes you to show you again .... and again ... and again)
