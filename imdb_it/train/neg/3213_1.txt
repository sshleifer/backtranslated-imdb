Well, I can honestly say that this is the first time I've experienced a movie that literally had no meat or potatoes in it. The whole movie seemed to be the salad without a main dish. The plot was fallible and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, realism was out of the window and the animation was made by four-year-olds. Does this cover it? I've never been more embarrassed about a concept in my whole life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the looks of the other reviews I am not entirely at the base of my observation. <br /> <br /> To start, the story moved too fast. For someone new in this character and in these situations, I needed more resources to create the reasons instead of finding the solution. I have seen other Souls (if I could call this an Anime) doing great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing reserved for Lady Death. In some short scenes, we see his train with Cremator and immediately becomes this aggressive beast of hell. For me it was difficult to swallow, considering a few moments before it was presented as a weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly, she is immersed in hatred and can fight with an existence that has existed for millions of years. This was absurd. Lady Death's presentation was poor, to say the least. I felt like she was nothing but an animated character instead of a desperate woman with a vengeance in her mind. For me, it just didn't work. It was nothing but a pleasure for prepubescent boys who wanted to watch the masses of skin that suddenly grew on her chest when she trained with Cremator. Oh, I felt bad just looking at her. The same goes for Cremator's character. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I remained a more incoherent stammering of the current development. It's a very sad day in hell when we give up the characters to show more violence and action, especially in an animated film. <br /> <br /> Next, there was Lucifer himself. Let me tell you that I think I could fight with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was ridiculous, and he simply didn't represent the image I had in my mind. It was like Disney had control and wanted to make it semi-PC. He lacked the darkness and the corrupt nature that Lucifer embodies. He was not the ruler of Hell, but only a footman who had a bigger place to live. About living or dying, how can you die in hell again? This was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most of the characters were worried about dying when they didn't even think they were dead. That's how they arrived in Hell. I think it was this level of thinking that ruined the film for me. I really didn't understand the idea that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but could it be just me? or perhaps because there was NO DEVELOPMENT in this story. There was nothing built, just preparation. <br /> <br /> The battle sequences were hysterically bad. The animation of this cartoon seems to have been made in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive about the way this film was designed. Why are we, America, so far behind in animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's crawling here in hardcore because we keep making movies like Lady Death that don't challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this film proves it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was bad. Animation combined with horrendous vocal work was cheap. I've been dealing with this film for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this film on my credit card. Production was horrendous as well as history. Nothing has been developed, leaving huge holes in the plot that almost everyone has fallen into. The strength of the characters was missing and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this and would like to warn others so that when Death comes, you are not in my state and you regret the fact that you wasted 80 minutes with this piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Vote: * on *****
