This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. It doesn't work at all. First of all the dramaturgy is completely wrong. At the beginning it is very slow and then moves quickly and unsatisfactorily until the end. But there is also (and this could have to do with cuts) a restless movement between the genres. It starts with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than a satire. the ending can be fun but it is also so blunt that I almost heard insulting my intelligence (what little there is). So the film tries to be everything but really fails at any level. You can also see it in a very unstable character development. You almost have the impression that Connery plays three roles rather than one.
