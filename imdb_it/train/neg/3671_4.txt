Boring, predictable and uninteresting story of a man contaminated with a chemical (Weller) who crosses the country only to find his ex-wife and children; meanwhile, he kills everyone on his way with just a touch of his hands. In his dangerous track, a doctor (Hurt) and a young reporter (Natasha) try to stop the man. The film has a non-original premise but it could be much better. The end result is just a film without moments of suspense or grit. Even the good cast is completely wasted. I give this a 4 (four).
