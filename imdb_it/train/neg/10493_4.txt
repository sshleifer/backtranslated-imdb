A difficult film to classify. I never gave him 110% concentration and as a result, no matter how simple the plot was, I certainly couldn't say exactly who was doing what between the American FBI characters and what their roles were. Nor could I take the Irwins seriously as movie characters when their lines and scenes were all in the style of one of his plays, not acting. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of a Discovery TV show, with a largely insignificant under-plot in progress, which seemed to hinder. However, as every Irwin show always deserves a watch, this movie also deserves to be seen, but not on Christmas day. By the way, I have better things to do than be here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
