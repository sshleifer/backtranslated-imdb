It occurs to me that some of the films that were banned during the course of film history were actually very important and very good films. I would like to argue that instead of banning difficult and controversial films, the censors should consider banning such bad films as a threat to your IQ and your sanity. If they did, one of the first films to quickly hide would undoubtedly be "Stroker Ace". This film is horrible with a capital "A". It's the worst movie Burt Reynolds has ever starred in ... a feat for a man with "Cannonball Run II", "Cop And A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" on his CV! <br /> <br /> The wafer-thin story introduces us to the success of the car driver Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a man who loves fast cars and fast women. It crashes into a demeaning contract with crooked promoter Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty). The contract requires him to do a humiliating promotional job for a new fast food chain, like dressing like a giant chicken. Thrown in the mix are Lugs (Jim Nabors), the crabby friend of Ace, and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a child with a brain slightly smaller than a pea who is courted by Ace. <br /> <br /> Hal Needham, the director of this low-quality junk, was once a stuntman and made numerous films based on his experience in staging spectacular stunts and car chases / races. Some of these films were OK, like "Hooper" and "Stunts Unlimited", but with "Stroker Ace" he achieved a career nadir. The characters are so stupid that they actually feel pity for the actors who play them. In particular, Anderson has such a stupid role to make you grit your teeth with despair. Humor is weak and childish all the time, and stunts and running sequences are insignificant. Even the out-takes during the closing credits (which can be found in all Reynolds-Needham collaborations) are generally not funny, which gives the impression that maybe the film wasn't very fun to make. "Stroker Ace" is a stinker of considerable magnitude.
