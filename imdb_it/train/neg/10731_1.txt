The film is basically the story of the return of a Russian prostitute to her native village for the funeral of a sister / friend. There are a couple of other minor plots that might actually be more interesting than those taken, but they are not completely explored. The core of the film is the funeral, the wake and the subsequent controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka, but now the artist is missing who made his dolls sellable. Apparently, the film has not been modified. The journey of the prostitute from the city to the village is a terribly endless train journey and a vagabond through the mud. Perhaps this should impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and a male, the wife of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and in the end it seems impossible. Much of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that the subtitles do not include the songs and the laments of the crones. Don't go to this movie unless you speak Russian fluently.
