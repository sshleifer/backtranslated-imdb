Last weekend I bought this "zombie movie" from the business container and watched it with some friends thinking it would be a cheap version of "The Land of the Dead". <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that they spent a good part of their cover-art budget, which is very misleading for zombie fans. <br /> <br /> We looked to the point where the zombie chicks come alive and get into the car with some yuppies who are out in the middle of nowhere talking about business on a cell phone. They actually talk to the boy before one of the girls kills him; but once they started driving the car, I could no longer suspend disbelief. <br /> <br /> Some consider this a film "so bad, it's good", they are liars. I didn't finish the film, but one of the other reviews says that somehow they became police officers at the end of the film, which makes me happy not to have seen it all the way. <br /> <br /> This is even worse than "Zombiez" DON'T LOOK!
