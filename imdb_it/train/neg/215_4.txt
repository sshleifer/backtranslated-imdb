I'm not so much like Love Sick as I imagine. Finally the film expresses the sexual relationship of Alex, Kik, Sandu, their love triangle was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, at the end Alex woke up and realized that they would have no result and future. The end was sad. <br /> <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was in the AMC theater on Sunday 12:00 of 10/10/06, with us we saw the film together. After the film he told the audience that the intention to create this film that was meant to express Romanian sexual relations was a bit complicated. <br /> <br /> From my point of view sex life is always complicated everywhere, not perceiving particular impressions and effects from the film. The loving process of Alex and Kiki, and Kiki and his brother Sandu were a kind of story of the neighborhood next door. <br /> <br /> The two main reasons why I don't like this film are, first of all, the film didn't tell us how they started falling in love? It seems that after Alex moved into the building where Kiki lived, then two girls fall in love. It makes no sense. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments, you have to imagine and connect these stories with your mind. Secondly, the whole movie didn't have a scene of Alex and Kik's sexual intercourse, it's what I've been waiting for ????. However, he still had some parts that he deserved to recommend. The "ear piercing" part was quite interesting. Alex was willing to endure the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. It was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Moreover, the scene in which they were in the football field, the conversation expressed that their loves were truthful and passionate.
