The reason I was going to give this film the chance to take 2 hours of my life (actually it was only 35 minutes) was my desire to try to understand and, I hope, appreciate Indian cinema. All I ever saw were some older films from S. Ray. <br /> <br /> Browsing through IMDb I came across this and after seeing the score of 8.7 I concluded that this must be the one that will open the doors of the unknown and brings artistic entertainment. Oh my how wrong I was! The only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of the 970 people who voted are Indian and their only adventure outside of Bolliwood production was Adam Sandler's films. <br /> <br /> With this rating this film will be ranked 9th on IMDb. List of the 250 best films on Citizen Cane, Goodfellas of Psycho! I am not really in the mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that he deems worthy of being remembered by this painful experience. My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindus that I like to find this film as it is - just stupid, with plenty of kitsch and cheese music.
