This may or may not be the worst movie Steve Martin has ever done, but he certainly was far from his best. Obviously, he made this shit for the pay. Dreck like this certainly does nothing to improve his reputation as a funny man. What he doesn't seem to understand is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie, they expect to be entertained, not bored by tears. It's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I don't understand why talented people can't understand that people don't want to see them in bad movies. If you're going to call a movie a comedy, then it should be fun. This was not. It is a pity for the American army to have let itself be associated with this pabulum. Full Metal Jacket had more laughter than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy". Surely, Phil Silvers is rolling into his grave.
