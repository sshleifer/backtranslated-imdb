Veronica Mars's biggest mystery is not what she had to face on the screen. Rather, the mystery is why this perennial assessment of disappointment is still on the air. This week marked a peak for Veronica Mars: she ranked 146 of the 146 shows of the 6 big (which will soon become the Big 5). Yes, you read that right. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now defunct WB and by every show on UPN. It was beaten by all the shows on Fox and, of course, by all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. <br /> <br /> Now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a repeat. But everything on TV that week was pretty much a repeat! It drives the mind crazy because CW would have chosen this disappointment proven by the ratings as one of the few shows saved by UPN. <br /> <br /> Clearly something is going on behind the scenes. The favors are exchanged and the influence is touted. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? The line "Veronica Mars has potential" is clearly dead now that they have had two years to settle and failed to do so. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the influence and weight of Joel Silver, but frankly, I'm at a loss because someone should choose to spend their weight on a bad show that no audience is watching. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for CW.
