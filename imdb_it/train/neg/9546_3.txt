If you thought the original of the 83 was bad, try this modern masterpiece. How could it be worse than most ask? Well ... at least in the first you did wear Ally Sheedy in a sports bra. Apart from the updated graphics, modern day themes (like terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy voice for Ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. Anyone who saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / story line was going. And for all those who have not seen the first ... well, considered lucky to have seen it only once. Maybe in another 23 years, Hollywood will try again.
