It's not exactly my thing, this street-to-DVD fight action is one I've only met because of a friend who wore it while we had some beer. I'm relatively open, and rather a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I relax ready to have fun. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone is the story of Isiah Bone, a former swindler who becomes a fighting road for unclear reasons that will eventually evolve as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a boring movie. I understand that films like this don't rely much on the plot, but must they make such stupid, predictable and totally stupid stories? It may not be important, but for a delicious gum it bothers me. Better no plot and pure action of a bastard chick of a narrative. Infused with a completely unfounded and unattainable sentimental drachma, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thin-skinned turkey full of slimy rots. Probably at this point I should mention what is obviously the starting point of the film: the fights. Even in himself, the fight is rather poor. Bone manages to find robust and established street fighters in single fists (a big or two or two is the brave attempt of filmmakers to correct this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish ploy. This too is repetitive and stupid, the arms broken and the faces kicked with a constant alacrity that we can see from time to time. <br /> <br /> A run at the mill, film filmed by number that fully deserves its direct to DVD status, doing absolutely nothing new and everything we've seen over and over again. And not particularly well either.
