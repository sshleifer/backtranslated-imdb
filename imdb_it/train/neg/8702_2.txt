This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I should have expected it, having seen the first two, but I still get sucked into these types of films with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it this time". No, not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? How about special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what passes for SFX in this film, at one point a soldier is shooting at a "Raptor" as he runs down a corridor. Even with less than a second of screen time, the viewer can easily see that he is just a man with a tail apparently tied to him running around. Very bad, bad. <br /> <br /> And acting? If that's how you can call it. There is a character who, I suppose, should come from the south. However, after living in the south for six years, I never felt this way of talking. Perhaps he has a kind of strange disability - the inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - so there was no reason for the actor to try to do it. <br /> <br /> And the plot? It's pretty simple: the Raptors escape, people with guns have to hunt them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs of these films always seem to run into the nearest tunnel system ... wouldn't they be out hunting prey? Oh well, at least they have the good sense to appear very little in the movie that supposedly revolves around them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there are men who eat birds of prey that run inside us. Would you decide to take time to discuss who is better - Army or Navy? And then decide to organize a wrestling match to fix it? What about the idiotic idea that they have to track down birds of prey? Divided into groups of two. Have they ever seen any horror movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the stupidest movies out there. Missing unless you want to make your way through a movie.
