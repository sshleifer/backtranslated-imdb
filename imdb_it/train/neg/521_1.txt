Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this poorly written script and given it the green light. The cast is uniformly in second place with some really horrendous performances from almost the entire cast. The story is separate, fragmented and inconsistent. The story, leaden and predictable. No intelligence, no charm, no humor. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain flat like the proverbial pancake. There is also a strong current of misogyny that has become increasingly difficult to bear as the film progresses. When your advantage (Carrell) is little fun and unattractive is uphill from there. Despite the false pretense in which love triumphs over lust, I still have a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humor and social commentary, then we are decidedly doomed.
