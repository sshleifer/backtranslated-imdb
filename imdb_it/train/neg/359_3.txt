I saw my fair share of ill-conceived endings and final twists in the films, but I don't remember any film that committed suicide like the one it did. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were clearly hoping that the big breakthrough would "surprise" us all ... and so it was, but maybe not in the way the filmmakers had hoped. I was surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The film up until the last thirty minutes was quite engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film as a whole. But once the turning point was revealed, the holes in the plot and inconsistencies were considerable, the reason behind revenge was poorly conceived and the way things were so sharply elaborated for Bobby Earl was ridiculously unlikely. What's worse is that, once the turning point is revealed, the rest of the film has become terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris gave a formidable performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in the sense that he never gives a bad performance, even if the film is not great! So all in all, it starts well and the performance keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes are one of the most memorable dives in the history of cinema.
