Usually I comment only on the films I like, imagining "everyone to his taste", but here I want to make an exception. The premise of this film, which somehow seems to be lost in the fray, is that these two self-centered adults have the perfect right to go to Las Vegas, get drunk, marry and inflict incalculable suffering on their brood of children. Even admitting the culturally sanctioned intoxication, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and to cancel what they have set in motion. After all, "love" is all that is important, isn't it? To hell with everyone else. If things "resolve themselves or not in the end" is not really the point; in fact it is quite irrelevant. The point is that the lack of respect for others, especially if they are young, and especially if they are in a position of dependency, is made lighter and therefore reinforced by this film. There are many more harmless behaviors that these "parents" could have accomplished that would have brought down an army of social workers in the blink of an eye.
