This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great film. Goodgfellas is not, but it is one of the best criminal films made. This film should be considered closer to THE STING Part2 or maybe Speed ​​Zone. Remember those gems! The only reason this film was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original. This film lacked everything that De Palma, Pacino and Penn worked hard at. There was not a nice character and this is the fault of all those responsible for doing it. I hope that INCREASE POWER wins every possible RAZZIE and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it to be a record holder. After watching this movie S @ * T FEST, I sat down and looked at Carlitos' original way to get the bad taste out of my mouth. After looking at it, I want Pachanga to come and chase me away from my misery.
