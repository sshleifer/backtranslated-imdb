I am a great brand for the music of Neil Young, and with this and the eloquent praise of the film received in many Indian press circles, I reached the first screening of Greendale I found. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid plot and the weak lyrical moment left most filmmakers asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that I just filmed the soundtrack. This is not the best way to create a story. No character really has a bow, and when "significant" events occur, the viewer does not care, because the nuisance levels of the film technique are so high from that point. The film is all right and, to this end, the characters put the texts in their mouths while they are sung ... the technique works for the first verse that was performed, and after that it is nervous. Does not seem true or false, it seems only unwelcome. <br /> <br /> Terrible acting, with characters who find a state of mind and play everything. Poor lighting at times. The only compliments I can give to the film are with regards to several scenes shot as news, but the technique is so used today in the cinema that this film has done little to promote it. A soundtrack in place, but nothing I'm quick to buy. A bad movie.
