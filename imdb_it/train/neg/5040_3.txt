I have read comments on this is the best Chinese film ever. Maybe if the only Chinese films you've seen don't contain dialogues, long looks and distant silences, and make-up changes, then you're perfectly in sight. <br /> <br /> complicated storyline? Almost. Youth and amateur test. Exquisite moods and disturbing memories? Almost. Try boring and trivial flat-out. <br /> <br /> This was terrible. I couldn't wait for it to end. Especially when the best jokes in the film are "How are you? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yes." Wow! What a depth of character. I imagine the incessant cigarette smoke would have to speak for them. <br /> <br /> Being a big fan of many Chinese, Japanese and Korean films, I was totally disappointed with this. Zhang's sentimental "The Road Home" was also better than this.
