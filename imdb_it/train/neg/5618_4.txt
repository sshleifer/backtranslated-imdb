I am really surprised by the amount of good grades obtained by this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary. Now, with respect to the boy's opinion and faith, I myself am not, in this state, a believer in the Christian doctrine taught. However, anti-Christian propaganda is a bit different. <br /> <br /> This film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very partial context. I'm not recommending not seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of an opportunity than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an inquiring approach to the subject, it seems like a personal revenge on the Christian school that struck his childhood. Christians are also travised most of the time as incredibly naive or fundamentalist, no moderation in the middle. <br /> <br /> The director uses scenes of the Passion of Christ without permission, organizes an interview with the principal of his former school and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. Actually I found the principal as the simplest person and I think his attitude was fully justified. I strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers interviewed were consulted after the intervention or even said the purpose of the inquiry before the interview. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. But the way in which all this is produced is often offensive, highly unprofessional and terribly partial.
