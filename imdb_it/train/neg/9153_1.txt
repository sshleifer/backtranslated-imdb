I've never published a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This film is SO SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how serious it is trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It is truly, not consciously BAD. This is a serious and gloriously lowered attempt. Other reviewers have highlighted the film's numerous flaws, so I will try not to repeat them, but I invite you to watch this film. In all this I was speechless, literally breathless, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. I haven't had so much fun watching a movie in years. In fact, I will try to show all my friends because it is the kind of film that needs to be shared. <br /> <br /> My favorite pieces: - When Arthur makes auditions - Baby (his dance is incredible) - Free nudity (the director / main actor only had to take a naked picture) - The preacher's office with its representation in cardboard and pastel of Christ - Certainly, the famous wedding scene with palms and forgotten rings (which narrative function does this game?!?) - The ex wife's wrestling match with Ben to take his pistol - The detailed sequence in which Arthur kills the preacher; apparently it burns him with this incredibly miserable match - Yes, the religious gay fanatic with his bleached hair and fashions from WeHo - E, my favorite, the use of Joplin "The Entertainer" as an initial soundtrack and "Canon of Pachebel "in D major" as the closing soundtrack! - the list could continue - MUST SEE !!!
