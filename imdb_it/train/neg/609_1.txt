This was an absolutely terrible film. Don't be attracted to Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting cannot redeem the ridiculous plot of this film. This film is a piece of US 90s propaganda. The most pathetic scenes were those in which the Colombian rebels were doing their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared false, and her pseudo-love relationship with Walken was nothing more than a pathetic emotional grip in a film that was devoid of any real meaning. I'm disappointed that there are films like this, ruining the actor like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit down.
