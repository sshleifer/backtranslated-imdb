Well! What can you say? First, this adaptation is too long at 4 hours, due to the complexity (or lack thereof) of the plot. The actors try hard to do something about this film, but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is NOT really a Quatermain character. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", Swayzee is not really up to it. This guy with the Winchester repeating rifle doesn't have the strength, stature, thinness, or humor needed for the part, and is overshadowed by everyone, including the sorcerer, who in my view seems to be more convincing of an actor that the rest of the cast. Some of the views are pleasant but there are stupid mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrives at the pool of water in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk inside them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (at the next blow) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed, etc. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In a sense, I wanted him to do it. <br /> <br /> The leader of the Russians who pursue Quatermain is a stereotyped character created in a poor way that shoots everything. <br /> <br /> Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, back in London, who is unable to obtain custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that kind of thing. He is unable to take the part of a brave gentleman with a strong heart, life experience and a sense of fair play. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. Barely
