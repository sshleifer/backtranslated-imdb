Watching Josh Kornbluth "act" in this film reminds me of my freshman television production class, where the "not funny" had the chance to show how little fun they were! <br /> <br /> OBVIO It is the word that comes to me It comes to mind when I try to synthesize this successful comedy. The lines are sophomoric and telegraphed. The delivery is painfully bad. OUCH !!!!!!! The writing is simply Dorkese. It is similar to a Bob Saget show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is as painful as watching a Saturday evening scene live for an hour and a half (post Belushi). <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and I want my money back !!!
