Diana Muldaur appears in Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice - maybe it was the hair. Regardless of this, this time it is not the receptacle of a god (see the previous episode) but it is a very famous woman with magical powers that allow her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man who is most in love with her is a couple of cards running out of deck and trying to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, strangely, lives in a small box - this is a bad way to travel). And unfortunately, Muldayr is not very well hurt herself. What happens next is a bit stupid and when the episode ended the first time I saw it, I was pretty relieved. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga on Muldaur was pretty silly and Spock's acting when he went crazy for a short time was rather campy. Do yourself a favor - if you've never seen the show before, choose a different episode.
