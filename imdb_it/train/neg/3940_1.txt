This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise movie. If you have trouble sleeping, then everything means renting this movie. The stylized figure they call an actress who is supposed to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Perhaps it could be used as a support for hats against the background of a real movie. Five minutes of nothing thanks to you that you ever invented the fast forward button. If you see this movie, if you can call it, CORRE. I can't help but think about what the third world could do in the world of money wasted on this shit. this movie is boring, the actors are boring wasting color, a wasted air that they breathe If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film, then look at what they did in the 60s, maybe what the director should do.
