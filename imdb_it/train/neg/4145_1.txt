Ok, I watched this movie twice, I searched heavily on the net, I asked several people about those opinions. I even went to read the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book on which this film should be based. I feel that the best way to review this film is to describe a game to play while you watch it. Since the film's plot doesn't seem to make any sense, here's the plot of the book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her father, Mr. De Lafontaine. They continue with their lives blissfully and peacefully. One day they receive a letter from the "General", a man who fulfilled his mission in life to avenge the death of his daughters. He makes statements about the fact that the supernatural powers are at work and explains that he will visit them soon. Meanwhile, a chance meeting with a strange woman leads the Lafontaines to look after her daughter, Carmilla, for several months. Soon Laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and starts to fall with a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does it have to do with Laura's condition, and the General? <br /> <br /> I invented this game and I would like as many people as possible to play, and let me know what their results are. I also have a catchy name and I too would make a rattling, but I can't be bothered. It's called "this movie doesn't make sense". <br /> <br /> All you have to do is, while watching the movie, try to come up with a complete storyline explaining what's going on. I mean complete, all questions are answered, everything makes sense, absolutely complete. <br /> <br /> Will you have to answer questions like ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around in daylight? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl called Bob? and why did she shoot herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the film a dream and when is it real? <br /> <br /> * Why does killing zombies seem to be an accepted part of life that does not cause anyone to blink? <br /> <br /> * Because Travis Fontaine detects and drips a zombie without slowing down while driving his car, yet in front of a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, she accepts the excuse that she is also one zombies? <br /> <br /> * And why then does he leave a girl, who later openly reveals that he knows how to be the vampire boss, drive with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And then let her leave, alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the kindergarten scene? <br /> <br /> * What the hell is the green goo talking about? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse? <br /> <br /> * Why does no vampire fight? Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? What is it made of? why kills vampires? and how does Jenna know that? <br /> <br /> In fact, it's just as fun to try and ask so many questions about this movie. <br /> <br /> I have my storyline, and I have to admit that it's not really there, but it's a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> In conclusion <br /> <br /> "Vampires vs. Zombies" has no time when there are actually Vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the film seems to know exactly what's going on, yet they seem very reluctant to let the public focus on this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century horror novel. Such as? Why? What the hell is going on?
