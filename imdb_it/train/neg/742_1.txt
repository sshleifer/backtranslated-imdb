If this film had a budget of 20 million I'd like to know where the money went. A monkey could do CGI effects better than the one that was wasted for 3 hours in this terrible piece of junk, although I have to admit that the machines and the Martians would have been really cool in an original play station 1 game and in the first games PC since the mid-90s if a game had ever been made. What puzzles me where the money went? Pendragon's films could have made a great film with good old-fashioned models and computer-controlled cameras at the George Lucas around 1975-83, and actors who actually seem worried about what they're doing (or spoiling in this case) for the same 20 million. This is probably the worst movie ever made! I'd rather watch a repeated 24-hour screening on Ishtar than watch this movie again. I hated him completely! Disregard I say this is the worst movie ever made because unlike other bad movies like Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes, or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, these are movies that are so bad that you have a special place in your heart for them, there do you love. There is no love for this movie and no place in my DVD collection for this. I sold it to a guy for a dollar. I bet the money for the film was spent on alcohol and other vices for the cast and crew. Too bad for Pendragon's movies! I want my money back!
