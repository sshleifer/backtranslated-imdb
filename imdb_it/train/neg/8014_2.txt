"Wild tigers I met." You will only see it in the big cities, to be sure. It's one of those artsy SO movies, which makes no sense what ever, except for the director! I hate those! And all those so-alternative / artistic people EXPERIENCED try to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT horseshit. <br /> <br /> There was NO plot, no story, no morals, no chronology, and nothing funny or even touching. For me, it was a bunch of scenes put together that had nothing to do with each other, and they were all for "show" to show how "artistic" and "visual" they could get. He was an ATTEMPT TO ANOTHER adolescent anxiety film, but the mark was missing at all levels humanly possible. So the credits roll! I was waiting for SENSE to do it! I was waiting for "the good part". I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could be called "art house" movies. This will NOT be between them. You will be very angry with yourself for paying to watch this movie, much less ever having bought it on DVD.
