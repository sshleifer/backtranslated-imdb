I rented it thinking it might be interesting, and it may have been an interesting story, except that it was told so uninterestingly. Difficult to follow, strange montage, disconnected plot, the characters murmur, all in all a terribly boring waste of time. I couldn't get in and I didn't care what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm couldn't save this movie. Unless you need a cure for insomnia, I'll skip it. 3/10, and is generous.
