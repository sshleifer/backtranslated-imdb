After an initial release of 4 very good Eurotrash titles, REDEMPTION managed to scrape the bottom of the barrel with THE BLOODSUCKER LEADS THE DANCE. I haven't found Bloodbuckers anywhere in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. A mysterious count invites several actresses to his castle for a short vacation. After some soft sexual suffering the girls are beheaded one by one. Who is the murderer? Who knows? There are many more tracks in this than the local fish market on Friday. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is heartbreaking. The story is stupid and the skin scenes aren't that great. <br /> <br /> Give this a miss.
