Bad trash / movies is usually not bad because I will find them funny. This is so serious that I have no words to describe it - it is below "bad". There is an instruction at the beginning of the film that tells you what to do during the movie. Needless to say, education and a dozen beer could not help me sit through the film. A tagliner compares it with KILLBILL which is certainly unthinkable and an insult to our intelligent. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to tempt you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of renting this, put it down! If you're thinking of buying, don't think! If you are unlucky to have this DVD, do not play, throw it in the trash immediately.
