OK. So it's a low budget "movie" (I used the quotes because it was shot in the Hi-8 video). The acting is universally horrendous, the trick is ridiculous (the blood seems to come from Sherwin-Williams and I've seen more convincing bruises made by Halloween ghoul kits), and the lighting generally seems to have used the borrowed Toyota pickup from someone to shine headlights on the actors. <br /> <br /> I might be able to forgive these low budget traits if there were real content, if a film tried to tell a story. But this collection of video clips can boast of having no plot, real characters and no impulse. It's a self-indulgent disaster. <br /> <br /> And don't worry - no spoilers here, because there's absolutely nothing to ruin.
