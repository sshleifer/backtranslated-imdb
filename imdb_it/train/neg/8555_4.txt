This is a very old and cheap movie, a typical low budget B-Western in so many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star and this film is very reminiscent of the first John Wayne films that were made for the "poverty" studios. With both actors, their style and personality were not yet fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper doesn't look exactly like the Cooper a few years later (he talks among other things faster in this first film). <br /> <br /> However, unlike the medium B film of In the Era, there are at least some interesting elements that make the film unique (if not good). If you want to see the woman who was married to Errol Flynn for seven years, this is your chance. Lili Damita interprets the feminine love interest and this is a very, very strange choice of casting, as she has a strong accent (she was French) and was not even remotely "pretty like a movie". Incidentally, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and bizarre aspect of the film is the apparently homosexual subplot - a sort of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN of the 1930s (and we thought this was a NEW idea). The character of Gary Cooper was raised by two men who hate women and do everything possible through much of the film to keep Cooper away from women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many clues in the film that indicate that the film's creators were really trying to portray them as a gay couple. In particular, towards the end, when one of them is killed, the other is hit by an arrow and resists death long enough to crawl over his fallen friend's body and then fall - with his arms around him! This has been pretty sharp stuff for the time and I think this makes this boring movie really boring today! As for Cooper and the plot, the film is a bit disappointing and very occasional. Unless you are curious about Damita or homosexual nuances, do yourself a favor and find a better Westerner.
