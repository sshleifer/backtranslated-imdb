Now I'll be the first to admit it when I say something that can be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my complaint about how much I didn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> it sums it up too I didn't like this movie. To be more specific, I didn't like the concept of this film. Cinematography was good. The mood was beautiful. And the acting was satisfactory. <br /> <br /> However, the story is fatuous, inaccurate and misleading. It is also offensive. <br /> <br /> I am a Cree Indian and, for some reason, I feel personally insulted by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And this is not a racist observation, I swear. The thought of a white, Hispanic or Native American swinging a katana on a roof offends everything that the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbued with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. For Ghost Dog, using his cannons instead of the Katana is also an insult to the lama and the souls inside, and where on earth did he take a Katana anyway? It must be one of those replicas, which offends the Samurai caste even more. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, Ghost Dog showed no honor. Towards the end of the film, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then kills a man by shooting him in the face through a drain cock. It's not just a cowardly way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninja way; silent killers; a group that denies the samurai exists, but cannot stand anyone. <br /> <br /> Then try to kill his boss when he finds out that his boss is a villain. Do you know what a real Samurai does when he learns that his master is bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to show that he would prefer to die and then lower himself to the level of his Doggish master. <br /> <br /> All that concerns the character was a gigantic contradiction with the real code to which all the samurai adhere: Bushido. <br /> <br /> So, we have a great cinematography, a good atmosphere and so much acting that includes a satirical plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it), making it an overall film unsatisfactory, insulting everything an honorable bushi (samurai) holds dear. <br /> <br /> 2.5 / 10 Bleah
