I like quality shit, and this ranks there with some of the best. cg is out of the world, or at least pre-dated to our world, and the folly of a 6-foot guy in a rat dress who chases people is ridiculous. I liked this a bit, but the acting is so damn terrible, and even the mandatory nude scene really has nothing to say. just a complete waste of time if I've ever seen one. I don't know who has lost the most time, me watching this, or the poor scholars who have been dragged along to do so in the weak hope that this will launch their careers. I can assure you, it won't. However, on a brighter note, I managed to successfully perform Kevin Bacon's 6 grades from this film, so I think it was almost worth looking at the 91 minutes of it.
