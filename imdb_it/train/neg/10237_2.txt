The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a Holocaust survivor, part of Mengele's twin experiments, which consists mainly of his version of what happened at Auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. The film has obviously had excellent reviews. It is one of those topics that no one dares to express a contrary opinion about. <br /> <br /> I, too, for most of the film, was sucked into the excitement that the filmmaker wanted so clearly for the viewer to focus on One of the user reviews on Eric Monder's IMDb (which obviously has nothing critic to say about the problem in a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. "In one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of Jews discuss with Kor in a Jewish center, the meaning of the word" forgive "is even debated, but the isolated and minority Kor holds it" But at this point, the fact that the film had on my sleeping emotional repertoire left me free enough to be able to see it clearly again. After the "strong-minded" Eva Kor forgives her "Nazi kidnappers", the film begins to investigate what forgiveness is, at least from Kor's point of view. The film continues to follow her, in addition to her public statement that forgives the Nazis and in a new territory. For me, this was the meat of the film, surrounded by the inedible fat of its "act of forgiveness". Obviously, he was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> In a mission to test his theory of forgiveness, in order to heal the wounds of the past, he makes his way to the "promised land" to meet some Arabs, to discuss with them the issues that must to face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with Jews in the United States about his act of forgiving the Nazis, including one at a Jewish center in Chicago. From that moment on, anyone who isn't so cross-eyed that he can't see the screen will find it hard not to notice the obvious contradiction in his statements. <br /> <br /> First, immediately notice your body language, defensive and reluctant to listen in a room full of Arab scholars and teachers. His comments on how he feared they might kidnap show how much of a waste of time, effort and money was the whole act. A rather annoyed Dr, Sami Advan (professor of education at the University of Bethlehem), does so when he tells Kor to make a statement about how he would prefer to sleep in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Finally, the debate at the Chicago Jewish Center, where it is "grilled" about the meaning of forgiveness and its right to do so, in the wake of those who continue to suffer through the trauma of the acts. <br /> <br /> I will cut in pursuit. At the end of the film, I hoped I hadn't chosen to watch the movie. The film was poorly made, having failed to investigate anything about Auschwitz apart from the mere banal, enough to make sure that the holocaust is refreshed in the memory of the spectators and to incite a burst of tears. He showed that Kor, the subject of the documentary, was unable to engage in a fair discussion. His discussion skills were limited to parroting his position on forgiveness (at best) to a complete reluctance to listen or participate. <br /> <br /> Finally, is everyone today so retarded that they don't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? Quoting another user of IMDb, "I do not see that his forgiveness is weak, rather, he just wanted to lighten his grip on his soul, he wanted the suffering to end, so he gave up". This would be the perfect definition for MAKING PEACE's layman. I imagine that, in a world of propaganda, blind trust and political correctness, there is no room to question those who "crossed more than the human" mind can understand ". <br /> <br /> PS The dictionary should certainly go into all those lists of books to buy that everyone continues to make.
