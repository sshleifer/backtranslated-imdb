The plot of the devil of Dr. Fu Manchu played by Peter Sellers in a parody of the characters created by Sax Rohmer is an injustice for the end of the sellers' career. The plot was very simplistic, and if done in the right way it could have been handled well, but instead it was poorly executed. Part of the reason why this film was not so good was the poor dialogue, the economic laughter, the uncertain direction and the embarrassing feeling that the film was rather incomplete. <br /> <br /> Acting, on the other hand, was really the only thing that kept my interest during this confusing photo. I found the portrait of the sellers of the diabolically brilliant Manchu, with the occasional lines that will be remembered. For example, there is the scene in which Fu Manchu is confused which henchman is the one in which he says "Ah, it seems all the same to me." I hate to admit it, but I laughed aloud with that joke. <br /> <br /> Then of course a handful of strong supporting characters caught my eye with the likes of Helen Mirren as the boxing cop behind him, David Tomilson Sir Roger Avery (also his latest film, not it's a way to end a career), and Sid Ceasar (who does a rather capricious performance by Al Capone's relative who works for the FBI). These characters also kept an eye on me. <br /> <br /> Even the sets were beautiful. The oriental designs and the English society of 1933 have been elegantly depicted in this stupid image. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, my advice is to watch the movie if you're Peter Sellers or Sid Fan by Cesare. Otherwise, it is better to settle on the chewing aluminum foil.
