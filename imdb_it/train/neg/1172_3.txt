Every now and then a film arrives that gives me a twist and reminds me that my taste in the films I try to watch is not always impeccable. Normally I was away from things like this, but I was deceived by some positive reviews and Rohmer's pedigree. <br /> <br /> There is an initial and intriguing novelty in the production in which Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors to (digital) back-drops paintings of the French revolutionary era. This quickly fades and becomes as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint from the numbers scene. What remains is a boring and suffocating film about aristocrats in eighteenth-century France. None of the characters is engaging or funny. The rhythm is so languid, the dialogue so arduous, and the suspense is clearly a concept foreign to Rohmer, that I ended up not worrying about who had his head rolled, who housed who, or what the hell was to be the revolution. The film would have benefited greatly from a semblance of emotional build-up and a soundtrack (there is a beautiful classical music used at the end). Despite being so "talky", the film sounds a lot like a silent movie, and the worst kind of film, a boring and uninteresting movie on infinitely interesting topics. Only the most astute French historians will find something to take from this film, since it seems that they depict well-known events from a new perspective (the Lady is English and a monarchy). Otherwise, avoid this yawn at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia (I dozed off twice).
