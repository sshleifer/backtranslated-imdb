Baldwin really turned down to make films like that. The script, the music, practically everything in this film is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Sound effects of sound do not sound real, stick out too much (technical gadgets, etc.). If they are trying to make a film about things like this, at least try to become real with it and release those beeps and extra beeps, because those gadgets don't really sound that loud. Natural sounds like steps and similar non-existent, which give it an atmosphere of emptiness. <br /> <br /> The direction seems to be OK for a low-cost film (I hope it was a low-budget production), even if it sometimes seems quite amateur. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem empty and fake, they simply didn't shoot this movie very well. I imagine it would have been a good idea to have Baldwin speak Spanish rather than have Spanish actors speak in English, when we all know that their language is the most vibrant and alive, so the actors' performance can suffer a lot if you use a strange language. I mean, could anyone finally realize how stupid it is to make international actors who speak English look ugly? He should have a corpse long buried in film production. Has the production team ever heard of subtitles? This film still manages to portray the European police as lazy and corrupt, vulnerable and defenseless societies. I mean if the plot again goes like "Interpol can't make jacks, so let's call an American to bring down this international union" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures treads the same path as Columbia before this, producing only films for hell. I guess they also have some respect. Buyers should buy every dirty stock just because Sony puts something good a few times a year?! Maybe they should have used the same team as those who were doing Di Que Si - Say I Do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan do a decent job keeping the film afloat. It looks so much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
