Cybil Richards directs another erotic masterpiece of the Full Moon / Surrender Cinema. This time Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in a rather attractive silver dress) has the task of destroying all evidence of sexual activity. However she can't resist looking at the tapes and she likes them. The sex scenes are well filmed and set on a superb soundtrack (at least for this type of film). The cast is largely horrible and above all very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between the sight of sex files she can expose her chest and tinker a little down. It also adapts to a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves much more than this kind of fare. Here it seems naked, but in reality it is much more captivating in its silvery dress that narrates the "drama". Absolutely garbage film with Lovell and soundtrack the only saving features. Mediocre also for the production of Surrender and clearly also a new low budget for them.
