If at least cruelty and extinct deaths had a purpose in history to justify their inclusion, but the script was simply unintelligible and simply stupid. <br /> <br /> It didn't go anywhere, the story had no legible continuity. It was just a bunch of useless snuff points and a really stupid ending attacked as if to say ... "In the end * beep * you my enemies and my few defenders for looking at my garbage." <br /> <br /> I don't understand, a masked murderer who never removed his mask in prison, a scene of rape in prison that was to be the guard who raped an ugly serial killer deformed and killed by him and nothing other? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak policeman who was a waste of an actor like Pare, who didn't try to eliminate the guy who killed his cops, tortured a child, a woman and a dog and sent them to you guards on video. <br /> <br /> Policemen who for some unknown reason all wandered in the dark alone (individually) in his country house at night as a group of ill-written teenage characters to be killed in a Time like a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman hears them die in the dark one after another and continue to wander around for no reason until everyone is killed in turn. <br /> <br /> A bunch of horrible real-life snuff scenes of animals at the beginning without any reason or explanation, he was remembering, he was looking at masturbating, it was comedy for him ... what was it? Nope Boll has decided to throw it in to upset animal lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> then he seems to believe the word of a psycho path to let his family go if he kills himself ... a more stupid and stupid cop than you've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I try not to hate his works completely. I try to find some reason to explain an art of horror writers but this stuff ... pure shit. <br /> <br /> Boll what are you doing anymore? I hope you understand that because I know a lot of more deserving people who can't dream of getting the budget you get over and over again to make their films. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll actually at his best check "Postal" it was actually okay.
