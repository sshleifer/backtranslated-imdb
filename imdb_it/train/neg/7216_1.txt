I love westerns. I could see them all day. "The good, the bad and the bad" is my all-time favorite. I looked at "Silverado" probably for the eighth time just the other day because it was on CMT. However, this film, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst western I've ever seen. The acting was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious thing that looks at the compass. The only good thing I can think of is the pretty girl from the cellar. The long very obvious pauses in the dialogue seemed intentional only to recover time to make the film an acceptable length. This film was not even worth the new rental rate I paid at our local movie rental shop. I felt like I was being robbed and worthy of a rent refund if there was such a thing. The only reason I finished it is because I hate not seeing a movie until the end. I turned it off in half because it was so bad. For the director, do a better job if you decide to do another one. This is the kind of film that has the potential to turn people into Westerns.
