If I had not read his name on the DVD cover, I would never have suspected that this rather bold and old-fashioned musical was created by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from this, that I wonder if in the 50s and 60s the authors of New Wave would absolutely hate this type of film - it's so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I found also a bit surprising was the amount of praise some reviewers gave to this film - especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were not simply particularly interesting and all the characters seemed so insipid and stereotyped. If I were to see another rich person who was worried about how difficult it was to be rich or get a good sales price on a designer dress, I was going to vomit. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that, like the American musicals, not all French musicals are gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite Audrey Tautou's presence, I see no reason to recommend it as anything other than a boring strangeness.
