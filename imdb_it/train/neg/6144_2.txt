Ironically, even if he can do the "split", Thomas is a stiff complete actor. <br /> <br /> This film is engraved in my memory as one of the most light-hearted and incompetent movies I've ever seen. As such, I really like it a lot. <br /> <br /> However, the only reason this has more than one star is that Thomas is of great shape, and it's fun to see his small, muscular body perform various feats of gymnastic skills on rocks and poles from the strange shape scattered on the eastern part of Europe (including the notorious "horse with handles" in the shape of a cap in the middle of a village square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various crazy villagers). But let the poor boy open his mouth and try to emulate, and any illusion that a film career can have is immediately torn to pieces. <br /> <br /> Thomas had at least the excuse of not really being an actor. All the others in the film - actors, directors, editors, film buffs, etc. They are at least as bad, or worse, and many of them are professionals. So Kurt doesn't come off as badly as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If someone ever asked him to perform in a martial arts movie, I bet Thomas kicks him in the face.
