First, I won't tell you why I rented this movie, as I'm still confused by me ... <br /> <br /> Air Rage is very similar to any movie I've seen where an airplane is hijacked. Obviously there is an important person on the plane and the hijacker looking for revenge. The sad thing is that some of the methods to stop the hijackers have already been used in other films. Are we really getting so unoriginal so quickly? <br /> <br /> Even if it is Ice-T (which for some incomprehensible reason makes painful attempts at ACTING while it is not busy putting the "c" in front of the rap) who is glorified on the cover, the film actually plays the less surprising Kim Oja as a stewardess who is "surprisingly" ABOVE the five hijackers, who naturally returns to haunt them. As for the rest of the cast, the only person I could recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania of "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can't forget to leave out my favorite part of the movie, when a hijacker used a PLASTIQUE POUND to turn off a lock from a door ... BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> The script - atrocious. He got to the point where I could say something, which I felt would be a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the film. <br /> <br /> As for the special effects ... the only special thing about this movie I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and VCR for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the DID film takes place in the air. But because of the less than stellar performances, the only Rage in the film was that of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood to choose a movie, just because it's ugly. Please SAVE THE SAME, don't choose this.
