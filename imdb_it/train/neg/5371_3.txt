This film was quite a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and rather bloody) start of the film he begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and as I left the theater I wondered what it was. The characters remain superficial, the story is not at all convincing, most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very rough parts ... Like, the young policeman has to dig a body. Sure it's night And it's raining And he has to do it by himself ... yawn! Or The Manifestation of the Evil is "Nazi" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. There are some nice things, though, like the saber scene, the mountain views and some gags (running), but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can) it's not worth it. (3 out of 10)
