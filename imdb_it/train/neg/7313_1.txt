I wasted 5.75 to watch this crappy movie so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the point where the dog was split in the middle of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with being divided in half. <br /> <br /> What was the point of dragging Karen into the shed, she has already totally infected her room, could they simply lock her up where she would be safer. > <br /> Why would the Hermit go around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could ask his relative, the pig lady, to take him to the hospital? <br /> <br /> Why didn't you do it? Some of the characters worry about going to the city to ask for help when things start to get worse, are they really that lazy? <br /> <br /> Although Paul was threatened by the guy with the rifle to peek over his wife, Paul may have just sent Jeff or Bert home for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating. <br /> <br /> What was the point of the box? <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff come back to the cabin after he left when everyone else became infected, if a big fool left to go first if he hadn't just come home? <br /> <br /> If the police took all the trouble to gather the children and burn them on the fire pit, because they threw Paul halfway into the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade out of the river water, that crap has dirty leaves and bugs in it. Because the two children could not simply use tap water, it was also contaminated, so the stupid ending would still work.
