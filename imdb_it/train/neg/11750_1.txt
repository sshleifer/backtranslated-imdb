the guy who wrote, directed and looked at this shocking piece of garbage should really consider a change of chaperone. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I mean you! Seriously, who financed this shit? there are so many talented writers out there that money could be better spent. I think the idea is fantastic but the acting, the script and the direction are just awful! The jokes are not so funny, I understand they should take the mickey. MA Do it with style, this movie screams 1995 Saturday Night live skits. Because, I say again because the studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk - THEY NEVER GIVE A COMEDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE DIRECT AND STAR IN HIS MOVEMENT. DUH!
