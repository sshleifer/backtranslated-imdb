It had to be Freddy's last film (and it has been for over 10 years) - you would think they would try to make a good movie. But they turned out to give us the worst of the series (and this is saying a lot). The plot didn't make sense (I don't really remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's lines were even worse than usual. The only thing quite remote was a short (and fun) cameo from Johnny Depp (the first movie of "Nightmare" was his first). I also saw him at the beginning in a theater was the last section (Reaching Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well - the 3-D was very bad - the colors faded and the image came and went out of focus. Even the three flying skulls that were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYONE stopped laughing. It looks even worse on 2-D TV. Useless and stupid - even boring. Skip this and see "Freddy vs. Jason" again.
