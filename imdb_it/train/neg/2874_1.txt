This film begins in a rather gruesome way with a tied and psychologically tortured female. There is male complete frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs that lick their nipples, the female who loses control of her bladder. All shot in a cool gray color. Effective, but a little too much. We then go on to see the youth of the BTK killer as well as the present and its history of crimes. The tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer who enter the homes of his victims and talk to them lasts for quite a long time and is disturbing. Here we do not see imaginative or good images, it seems as if it had been shot with your home video camera. It doesn't look horrible, but in a sense, seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is rather unusual and chilling. What this film doesn't have is a drama, really. There are scenes of cops from time to time, but there's no excitement in terms of finding the killer. There is not much of an arc in this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is full of real movies about slaughterhouses. He is lost throughout the film and suddenly returns again and again. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and you don't have enough time to look away. And that I must reject. I'm all for low budget horror films, but I don't tolerate animal suffering. It was useless, excessive and arrives without warning. I am happy that Lionsgate releases things that no one else does, but they should have passed this film or eliminated the blood of animals. Stay away from this garbage.
