After reading all the rave reviews on this movie and some that give it so-so. In the end I decided to throw in my nothing. I agree that if it wasn't for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Shot in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all the true talents fled south down 77 years ago, at least until a gas tank allowed. I had a little laugh from the reviewers who subtly claim that they get a little more cerebral than many, claiming to have followed the plot without a minimum of confusion. This little story by the Crook brothers is like an old record with a jump. As an American, I understand the difficulties faced by Ind's film artists. A trip to Romania would certainly have wiped out the budget. Let's face it, this whole movie was a loop de loop from Claire in the gas station, Claire on the roadside, Claire in the stands, Claire at home, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. He had almost become monotonous and would have had if he hadn't been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living, but not write a two-page script and turn it into an hour, twenty hits. Before writing another script about dreamy ghosts, watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something like that and get some history. All the cast except the one mentioned above and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. Also, there is an appearance of co-director Jeff who is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film had is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis' derri√®re. Well, with all the sarcasm now satisfied, I continue to recommend the horror film just to see this young actress in the formative period of her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain to watch.
