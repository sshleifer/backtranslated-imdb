I rarely get emotional for commenting online on a movie. But I can't understand how this was done. Who did that? How could they think of being able to make a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film school, did they take a nice check from dad and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to join? Or was it by chance a long-time friend / distant relationship who did it out of pure kindness? I don't care, I don't want to know. He also seems completely embarrassed to be in it, mumbling his jokes and hiding his face to the camera. Meanwhile, the PDO must have been the Neighbors electrician, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the script, direction and editing were all abyssal, and frankly the apathy that overwhelms me right now means I can't be disturbed to spend more of my life thinking about this movie.
