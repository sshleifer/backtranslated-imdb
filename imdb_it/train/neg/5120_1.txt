This is not a movie, it is a 111 minute evangelical Christian sermon draped over the American state of # 1 sport, high school football. Another of the long and sincere messages to converts who are supposedly fired from the spirit enough to go abroad and convert their unsaved neighbors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue like "You have won the great when you accepted Christ" loses every possible encampment of the field from the disturbing intensity of the sunken black eyes of the director / trainer Alex Kendrick. Then there are the "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers prayed for rain, but only one prepared his field to receive it. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is destined to prefigure the miraculous climax, during which Coach asks for his anxious reserve kicker, "Son, do you think God could help you make that kick?" It is the kind of entertainment that could be expected to receive faith-based financing indefinitely, if only the hegemonic activities of the Bush Christian evangelical administration around the world had convinced us all to become "devotees" after their example. Look at that poor Giants coach in the apocalyptic finale, urging his team to cry "Who's with me!" while the devoted Eagles on the other side were quietly doing the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> So, do you think our terrifying back-up does its kick to defeat those self-centered Goliaths? Well, we all know that the Zealots can't lose. Put it this way: transfer the field of play to the deserts of the Middle East, replace Christian proselytism and this virulent absurdity can easily be repackaged as a Taliban-counter-superpotable parable, which devout worshipers of this junk might want to think about for a minute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately they don't care, nor need: as Coach tells his group of valuable empty prayer vessels, the answers are all here in this book. And the Christian right will devour this on their way to their Rapture, that final victory for which they have prepared their fields.
