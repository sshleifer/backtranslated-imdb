This was the third attempt by the director von Stroheim: it is rather crude and does not show the exceptional talent for the camera and the mastery of editing that he would have shown some years later with his masterpieces, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. Essentially we have a trio of beggars, masked by a Russian count and two Russian princesses who rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their purpose is to use counterfeit money at the gaming tables and win a fortune. Part of this plan is that the count (von Stroheim) insinuates himself between a visiting American ambassador and his "crazy" wife, courting her and hoping to earn something by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of taking even the life savings of the maid, who he has promised to marry. When he sees them together, he sets the room on fire, (von Stroheim and his prey are on the balcony of the room). Here von Stroheim first established his character as "the man you love to hate". He is completely evil and his character defects end up bringing him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is rough in its cinematography and editing and it's not worth seeing if you're not fascinated by the director. There is something nice - when he tries for the first time to meet the Ambassador's wife, he is reading a book - let's see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. Initially it was planned as a 210-minute film, reduced to 140 minutes from the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. The restoration on Kino Video restores the surviving videos (somehow damaged in most of the scenes) from the previous previous version to give us a 107-minute print.
