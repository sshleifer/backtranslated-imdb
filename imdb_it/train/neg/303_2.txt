It is impossible for me to objectively consider this film. Not that I didn't try, mind you - but I sit down, and jump into the aged VHS, and look at the opening ... and all of a sudden I have five years again and I'm holding my Care Bear and I'm watching the movie with open eyes and a greedy heart. <br /> <br /> I can see, objectively, that this film is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby-merchandising-mascots and disturbing prepubertal children with evil powers that has a subtle history and uninteresting animation. But my five-year-old says, "Yay! Care Bears!" every time I think about it. So - alone (cautiously, reluctantly) I would recommend this film to those who have seen it during their early youth and can invoke the incredible power of nostalgia as they look at it (like me) or those kindly cynical XY-ers amiably cynics who deliberately look for the wonderful / strange (a category in which this film ... certainly belongs). For those who are looking for a compelling film or healthy family entertainment: you may want to keep searching.
