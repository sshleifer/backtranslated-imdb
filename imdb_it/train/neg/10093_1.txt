I can't believe the great success brings this film. It was SO BAD. I was completely deceived by box art. DON'T MAKE IT! It's not worth it, I promise you. I don't know if the positive reviews for this film were a joke or something. I'm so disappointed. :( <br /> <br /> The description on the back of the box doesn't even match! The girl who did the voodoo on her is a stripper. The synopsis on the back says she's only 17. The people who write the description of the film also bother to watch it! "Those positive reviews had to be a joke they had to be: if someone actually liked this movie, then I lost all faith in humanity. <br /> <br /> And don't make me not even to start the story with respect to the title, or the fact that the entire film was shot in 2 different places, or that the policemen didn't even come close to real uniforms. "Who cares about the police uniforms!" the film's uniforms were perfect. <br /> <br /> This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and to all its fans.
