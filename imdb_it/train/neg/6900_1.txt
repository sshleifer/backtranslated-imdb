I just sat in the theater bored to death, I wanted to leave half the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan weddings. So they must make an appointment to enter the marriage. Yawn. <br /> <br /> The thing that made me most angry was the so-called rough joke ... They were highly UNfunny, clich√© and thrown in the face, to get you into the already boring movie. The acting was below average and I felt that this film went on and on about nothing but a bunch of wild jokes and a predictable plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the worst movies I've seen of 2006, little fun, bad acting, just ugly. <br /> <br /> Well, thank God a friend screamed at me. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
