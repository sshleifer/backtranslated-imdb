We purchased this series on DVD due to all the great reviews we had seen here. I gave him three stars because there is no doubt that sometimes acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact they are so brilliant that we have not seen the propaganda transmitted so smoothly over the series. If you look at it with discernment, you will see the entire litany of beliefs of the radical right being promulgated by the Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid giving away spoilers, I will refrain from pointing out all the dozens of specific cases. A brief look at the plots found here on IMDb will reveal that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide "Infomercials" and call them news, is justified by cute twists and passionate speeches by some of the best actors in the world . We have seen many shows and in the end we gave up with disgust when they justified the torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us. The series also manages to downplay male and female gays in subtle ways by using them as plot devices that depict evil people. All in all the complete litany of the religious radical right. No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America has lost its way in the first part of this century. As a scholar of history I myself would define this program as one with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and part of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American public during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle the propaganda can be, then do it by all means. Make sure you buy an inexpensive used copy so as to avoid enriching the Faux Network ultra-lights that produced this parody.
