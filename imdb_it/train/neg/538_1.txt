Wow, what a waste of acting talent. My husband and I sat down, both thinking, this must improve, these actresses are too good to have wasted time with this shit. Unattractive characters, trite and rhythmic screenplays last two hours. Actually I couldn't hack it and went shopping (the litter was more attractive than this movie). The husband stayed and confirmed that he did not improve - when Buddy is killed, you wanted everyone to be hit by a car and end their miserable lives. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful landscapes and customs cannot keep this alive.
