We went to see this film hoping to see some flashes of Jet Li that left us amazed in Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately too many of his combat stunts are so clearly false that it also took joy. Flying kicks would be much more impressive if you could not see the threads holding it while it flies in the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> Too much cartoonish and very disappointing.
