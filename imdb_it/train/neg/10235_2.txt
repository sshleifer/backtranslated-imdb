The only reason I gave it a 2 is that the filmography is so stylized these days that it has at least something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This film is asinine. It is like many other fodder for the 21st century house. Blood is free and simply disgusting. I didn't care about any of the characters, but I did care that some fool would take the trouble to write this shit: I was complaining about the money I spent, but my appointment and I left wisely after 40 minutes and went to an adjacent theater to watch the adventurous and fun "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably got a much higher score from me simply because I put up with the "Captivity" poop for 40 minutes.
