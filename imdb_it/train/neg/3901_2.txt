The script is pretty. Even if the casting is absolutely not editable. No style. the costumes do not look like some of the High Highbury company. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Mrs. Beckinsale speaks British English better than Mrs. Paltrow, even though in the acting of Mrs Paltrow lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse. Mr. Northam is undoubtedly the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he is romantic and not at all as sharp and insensitive as Mr. Knightley on the television version. P. S. The viewer cannot see Mr. Elton-Ms at all. The development of Smith's relationship as it was in the moving version, so it is not clear where Emma's whole test of creating an Elton-Smith correspondence (besides the portrait) was.
