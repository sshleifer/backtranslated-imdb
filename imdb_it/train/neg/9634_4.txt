Whatever the evaluation I give BOOM is only thanks to the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for the hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (his descending phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk train doesn't stop there any longer" and it's supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his show - but apparently he was the only one. Reportedly, Taylor hated him and Burton needed money. <br /> <br /> Whatever it is, it amounts to a hill of beans with postures of Taylor and smoking in its shrill manner, which explode at the servants and exchange bad talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who appears to be a visitor of a another film when it finally appears. <br /> <br /> It's so campy that among Taylor fans he's probably considered a type of thing to see. But if you can sit with it without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Unfortunately, this is the film that marked the end of Taylor taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Academy Awards. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
