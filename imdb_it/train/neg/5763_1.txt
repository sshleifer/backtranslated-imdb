<br /> <br /> "Take a step back for the Hollywood veterans?" (the wayan brothers have been "asked") this is what Hollyweird requested and this is what he got. However, like many of his recent decisions, this was a wonderful mistake. <br /> <br /> The director is so out of today's audience, the attempt to bring back physicality and gags instead of funny dialogues is just a disaster. I knew it, the public knew it and the CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a pity, why have they NEVER considered changing managers? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played two of the four main characters, without them it's just a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
