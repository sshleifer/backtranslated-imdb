With movies like this you know you'll get the usual ghost lines. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the story that is missing. This could have been overlooked if the lines had gone better. The problem is that there are not many lines. Of course, I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the talking parrot, there was no ounce of creativity in the film. I blame the director for not using the premise for his full potential. Eva certainly has the comic ability to show more but didn't have the opportunity to do so. Overall this film is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. In addition to this it can be skipped completely.
