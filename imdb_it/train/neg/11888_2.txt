To make a film about the alleged end of the world, there should be some facts and realism 1. We are never told why these people believe it. 2. The position is New Years Eve in Toronto, Canada. SO PLEASE SAY ME TO MY BECAUSE EVEN STILL BRILLIANT IN MIDNIGHT AND WHY (based on the costumes) SEEN AS SEPTEMBER <br /> <br /> 3. The acting was in that neo-natural style, which needed a director who knew how to do it. <br /> <br /> 4. the individual pieces of the story were all depressing and aimless. I could go on, but I don't want to make it as boring as the movie. <br /> <br /> evaluation * 1/2 (out of 4) 2 on IMDB scale <br /> <br /> thanks you are as always <br /> <br /> JAY HARRIS (aka) SIRBOSSMAN
