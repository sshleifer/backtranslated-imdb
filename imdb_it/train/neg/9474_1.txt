In today's Eastern Europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and a grudging grip from Melania. It attracts the attention of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money for the time with her until he finally wants to buy her outright. She has two pimps with different emotional attachments to her and is generally passed around as a piece of baggage without personal feelings. However, we are in the territory of "modern art cinema", therefore conventions such as the narrative structure, the illumination of the subject so that it can be seen, the shooting techniques that add rather than distract from the action and a vague plot consistent can be abandoned. Most of the time I had no idea what was supposed to happen and very rarely did I care. People started to leave the screening almost before the last latecomers arrived and I don't think I've ever seen so many people go out. <br /> <br /> Images are important to the director - the characters slowly emerge or disappear in a dark screen, we get prolonged shots of nothing in particular and a sex scene takes place in infrared. In fact, for a film so unconventional the sex scenes were extraordinarily ordinary; missionary positions among naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related oddities. But perhaps these days being ordinary is not conventional. <br /> <br /> Overall, almost completely devoid of merit. <br /> <br />
