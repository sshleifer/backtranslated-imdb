I saw this movie twice through a Pentecostal church that my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This film terrified my brother and me and shaped the way we looked at the world with distrust. It was not only the film, but it was also the philosophy that surrounds so many "Christians" on the "mark of the beast" and on kidnapping. This film, the church, and an unusual negligent education, lead to a severe paranoia of the future. For years I lived under the delirious affections of the church and the fear of being forgotten by Christ. I'm 40 now. I've spent years of consulting. I once explained to a psychiatrist this film and the belief system of the church and the family. I was anchored in a delusional disorder. Actually I started to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this cult philosophy really happened. I no longer fear the future, I have come to terms with the fear injected by its members from the church. I took this experience to accomplish a purpose, I am approaching my license as a psychologist specializing in childhood trauma.
