WARNING: THE REVISION CONTAINS LIGHTWEIGHT TERRACES <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe out there where Gone In 60 Seconds is an obscure, sharp, controversial independent film. Unfortunately in this dimension, Gone ... is a flashy, vacuous testosterone-based idiot with Nicolas Cage. <br /> <br /> For reasons that are not really worth the trouble, he and his large number of friends have four days to steal fifty expensive cars, only one of which has an alarm. This troupe is composed of the guy with the ears in the shape of a buffo who is said to be the new Superman; a guy who ran electricity in the X-Files; a former professional footballer and two black tokens. <br /> <br /> Their enemies are policemen, rival car thieves and Cracker's Bilborough, his Manchester accent appropriately flattened and expanded for the American public who is now used to that kind of thing from Daphne to Frasier. There is also Angelina Jolie, who has no character; save to be a repository for men's sexual desires. It is assumed that she and Cage are old flames, which is strange, given that they never had anything in common with a normal conversation in all the 135m duration of the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, the characterization is so scarce that every time anyone has a "moment" in which a violin plays in the background to accentuate the "emotions". It is not a spoiler to reveal that Vinnie Jones (who recreates his famous "hand ball" maneuver by Paul Gasgoine and is rather threatening when silent) only gets one line; not because his inability to speak is an integral part of the plot, but because his eloquent summary of the film's dubious morality after appearing silent is fun. Supposedly. After colliding with him in his "not-enough-acting-but-it-ll-do" London train, Cage jokes "I always thought you were from Long Island". My ribs, as you might imagine, have been well and truly tickled. <br /> <br /> In reality humor is the most underdeveloped aspect, from the tactile comic cop to the two symbolic black characters. This sees the biggest aspect of Hollywood taking hold; Why can't a black man appear in an important movie without being constantly aware of his skin tone and referring to it indefinitely? The younger man, who, like the older one, speaks for the whole duration, proclaims: "we blacks do not like the cold ... we are tropical people". Then he continues to express the desire to smoke a cane and watch Roots. Obviously he is parodying the image of blacks, but how funny is it? His older counterpart cannot speak without referring to himself, and therefore to his color, in the third person. "My black ass" this, "my black ass" that. Does anyone know black people who really talk like that? Thought no. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is reproduced almost without rest and with increasing volume, some of the tracks - in particular "Do not Stop The Rock" by Apollo 440 - so strong that they are actually more audible than the effects sound and dialogue. The surround-sound system also separates the two to the point of making them look like two different movies running together. No concept of background music here, it's the aural equivalent of trying to watch a movie while someone in the back of the cinema has their stereo turned on at full blast. "Keep that music down, young man!" <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and in many ways I liked it. It's just that it's predictable, lazy and mindless, with minimal effort to build it. Expectations at the box office are decidedly lower for this film. After being force-fed for several years, it seems that the public is starting to realize the fact.
