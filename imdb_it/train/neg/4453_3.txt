I'm sure the people who watch this move outside of Britian, this movie will be a fun watch, but for someone from the UK it's painful for mistakes. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film Elijah Wood gets out of a tube at the Bank station, which was trashed. He tells his sister, who is meeting "What happened here" and she replies "Oh, Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! The Tottenham are already in the city ... they are part of the city, they don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight against other fans the last place in the world they would do is Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. <br /> <br /> There are many other similar errors but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays the role of hooligan. He clearly decided that it was not worth trying to speak with an East End accent and instead opted for a Dick Van Dyke-style joke that made my ears bleed. It was accentuated by the fact that the rest of his band all talked the way you would expect West Ham fans to talk. This mistake made him incredible in the role and really ruined the film.
