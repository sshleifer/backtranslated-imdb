It's a bad movie, it seems there are only 5 policemen in Hong Kong, they weren't using the gun and this makes me feel like a Jacky Chan movie. All the while they were using their gun to indicate only suspicion. When they finally use their gun it is when they kill each other, what a funny movie. In the film, it's like all good guys die without a reason. <br /> <br /> Even the plot of the movie sucks, the story jumps here and there and the people get bored. But if you wanted to see a bloody movie, I think this is just a kind of OK movie, I think the US zombie movie is more bloody than this
