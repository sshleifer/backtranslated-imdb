Hanna-Barbera sucks life out of another famous property. Violence is watered down, stories are formulas, animation is bad, music is nasty and repetitive, and frankly, the show is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> At the time, HB put all of its series through the same clich√© situations, regardless of whether it fits the world of cartoons or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen ("Ehi Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular." Put together "and you can't miss it!"). Moreover, in an apparent "Benjamin private" scam, Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that characterizes them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> The addition to the disturbing factor is represented by the public service announcements in each episode (standard practice for cartoons at the moment, but still annoying). Popeye teaches his grandchildren by safely crossing the street, recycling, and - are you ready for it? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I am not inventing anything.) <br /> <br /> The only charm that remains from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's early voice, continues his role here. <Br /> <br /> It is worth trying once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
