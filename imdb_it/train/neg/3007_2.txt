Well, in the never-ending horror quest, we'll come across this movie, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some unreliable reason. The transfer is terrible and the quality sucks. I don't think this is due to a bad rimaster or anything, I just think the movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Obviously filmed in an abandoned school on a budget that no doubt was wasted on cheap beer and no hack talent, "Slaughter High" starts off slow and doesn't pick up until about an hour in . First, we come to see a 'nerd' while being chosen by a group of ... I actually don 'also know what they should have been ... athletes? The ringleader, with his ultra hookah, is so ugly that he should have definitely been chosen as the nerd. Then, there is a "big boy" and a couple of stupid losers and chicks that should be "hot", but they are not. It's a mystery why this trash group is looking at one of them, but I suppose the viewer assumes that these are the "nice guys" who choose a dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous since most high school students are interpreted by thirtysomethings. As other reviewers have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that) are a bunch of Brits whose accents glide over and over in this piece of shit. We are left to hypothesize that this group of "children" were the only students of this school, since their "meeting" is only theirs at school, which is now abandoned, they are the only ones. <br /> <br /> The killings are lame, the blood is not large and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me the creeps ..." and "Someone give me a beer" are highlights ... Not good. Skip this unless you're losing yourself with some friends and you want to laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher. If you want to see well, take "Bay Of Blood" from Bava, made 14 years earlier and much better. If you want to see a good BAD slash, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning". 2 out of 10, children.
