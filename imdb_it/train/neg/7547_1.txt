Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Honey, like bees, understand? It's called useless prefence. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the road) Basket: here is your doll, child. You really shouldn't be so careless with your stuff. <br /> <br /> Girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Hiss! Crackle ?? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Trash: Mmmm. Vicodin! Thing ?? ? (Tear open letter.) Wow! My ex girlfriend's calligraphy has really improved. And look, his missing daughter looks a bit like the girl with the doll who happened to be somehow responsible for being killed, in a sense. And she has my hairline. I wonder, should I torture myself and visit her? Let's see what my friends think about the district. <br /> <br /> Basketball male cop: HAHAHA. Willow is a funny name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: what's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Crone with a tree name: It is not his daughter, though. <br /> <br /> (In the tavern) Basket: Can you swing it? Wench as a large tavern with the tree name: Huh? Basket: (breaks a bee). Everything is ok. <br /> <br /> Sensually pretty, a previously promising actress who plays a scruffy maid with a tavern: that's nice. Honey is not a plant, though. <br /> <br /> (On the green) Willow: Oh, yes, and I have forgotten, you are the father my son, Conan, er, I mean Rowen. (Yawns). I could have stayed and lived a life with you. But I didn't. I wanted to be the princess of the hive instead. I mean, it doesn't matter. (He nods yes, wakes up abruptly, widens his eyes to the proportions of the souls). Mwah, kiss. I love you! What were we talking about? Basketball: who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Blink. Why. We are. You. To shout. To me? Is it because I took your Vicodin? Sniff. Snoring. What were we talking about? Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> Willow: My lips hurt. <br /> <br /> (In school) Rose: What is man? Incomparable twins, in unison: phallic symbol, phallic symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basketball: Get off the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is going to happen. <br /> <br /> (to the hives) Trash: Hmmm. Ready? Ow, ow, ow, oh bother. Silly old bear. Russian. <br /> <br /> (In the Queen Bee's villa) Sister Summersisle: you have so much potential. What are you doing here? Weren't you the stallion that Cher had slapped in the face of Moonstruck? (Licks the lips). Basket: I was going to ask you the same thing. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: how are you progressing? Let's talk about the meaning of my superfluous "s". Basket: Watch out for that bombardment of the trailer towards us! Aaaaah! Oh. It does not matter. Damn! (Puts another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back to the tavern) Tavern girl with massive and disdainful build: I tried Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I kept wearing the size of the bear costume from last year. <br /> <br /> Crone with tree name: HAHAHA. All the better for roasting that nosy cop, my dear. <br /> <br /> Girl with a big chest: Totally. <br /> <br /> Basket: That was the last straw that broke the back of the Basket Case! Take this, woman! (It bursts her.) (Edward Basket is mysteriously attacked from behind) A voluptuous table girl: EEEE! Snap out of it! Leave the island already and take me with you! Do I have to face you or what? Get it out, I say! EEEE! Basketball: Take this, wench! (He bravely kicks her in the face. His eyes roll back in his head and become Xs cartoons.) Voluptuous girl: snoring ?? (To Nicolas Cage's roast) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basket's cell phone rings in the middle of the scene of his bear suit and then the call is dropped. It's like a wireless ad: help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And do you remember when I produced the bullets I got from the Basketball gun? He looked so surprised. You should be more careful with your stuff, Nick. Hahaha. And your film choices. <br /> <br /> All: The drone must die! Basketball: (screaming) Oh, yes, whores? Well, roasting me won't help your damn treasure! Aaah. My legs! Honey, (darling, got it?) Put that flashlight down and get away from the Basket Case. Honey! Smokey bear says he doesn't play games. Hahaha. Thing ??? Watch out for that darting trailer! Ahh! Oh. Damn it, these flashbacks of my experimentation on drugs in the 1970s are getting old! Where is my heroine? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fireproof. Ouch. I think something bad is going to happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my first floor. Damn! (Six months later) Voluptuous girl in modern-day slutty dresses: I told that homonymous basket to take me with her. <br /> <br /> Innocent drone: I like helping people. <br /> <br /> Voluptuous girl: Then let me get out of my contract for the sequel! I think something bad is going to happen. EEEEE!
