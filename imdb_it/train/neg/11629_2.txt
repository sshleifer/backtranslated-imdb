** SPOILERS ** KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic, devoid of plot, and was made just to see the stars portray themselves. The most suspenseful scene in the film was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the PSYCHO shower scene. This movie actually expected users to believe that the character of Naseeruddin Shah had a good enough memory to remember where some shots were fired and how many! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER BEGINS *** <br /> <br /> In the end, the killer pours his liver to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah's character to run and shoot! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER END *** *** <br /> <br /> It is a bit humorous (just a little) at the beginning to hear the director and the cast members throw insults and hear Shabana Azmi exclaim, "Oh sh-t!" <br /> <br /> film baaaaaaaaaaad! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of ********** (2 out of 10)
