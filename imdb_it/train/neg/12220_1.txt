This film is actually worse than most movies I've ever suffered and I suffered a lot. Absurd nonsense. He has a terrible and forced dialogue; useless plot developments; scenes of "ghostly images" really designed, that look more like a recovery project than a high school than a horror film; 5/10 to the best attractive women; long and boring sex scenes involving women (forget what you know about virgins! especially those with fake breasts on their tits); murmured speech, difficult to understand by some characters; and actually they used the masks of Killer Klowns of Outer Space during a masturbation scene, which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny, but it's not. Veden Fell is the worst villain in film history. <br /> <br /> Absolutely give this one a lose.
