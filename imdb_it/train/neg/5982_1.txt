I'm very sorry to say, but "Thunderbirds" doesn't even have a strong pop, no matter a thunder. At one point I seriously considered going out of the cinema, I remained in the desolate hope that the film could improve. I would have been disappointed, not improved, it got worse if possible. If I had gone to see the film with the thought that it would be a "parody", I would have been disappointed. They had an excellent opportunity to make a great series of films here, they completely wasted this opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be embarrassed to have the names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes, well, what can I say, he should be embarrassed and shameful he wouldn't be too far from the truth. I saw this movie in a pre-release, I was waiting to see it more impatiently, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say that I was disappointed would have been an understatement. One last thing I will say about the film is that the puppets of TV shows were only a little more wooden than those of the actors in the film.
