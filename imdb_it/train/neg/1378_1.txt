It is as if a bad TV program of the 80s had been unleashed and tried to become a soft-core porn movie. Oh my god it was bad. The plots of each character had little relevance. The plot itself was nothing to talk about. Something about a stalker, I guess. Does it eventually shoot? It's not very clear, but somehow there's a volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) sleeps a lot. The only reason my friends rented this film was because Casper Van Dien was there, and they finally decided to go ahead with the scenes with him, which were barely watchable. Thank God I didn't spend money on this, but I want to go back to that hour in my life.
