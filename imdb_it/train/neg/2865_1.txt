Generally I don't minus and if this site could give this movie -3 out of 10 it means that I really hate this movie. I thought Uwe Boll was alone in the dark was the worst I've ever seen, but at least I gave a 2.5 out of 10 in my opinion (Stephen Dorff didn't shoot anything, made me laugh so I increased the charts). To hell with it being comparable to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would win an Oscar for best film if they were competing. <br /> <br /> Now for the plot, this movie is about the BTK killer which is fine, but they could have done better The start looked OK, but I had to accelerate most because death is boring. I like killer movies and, even if they suck, they could still have fantastic deaths. I'm not a cinema expert, but believe me he would have shot himself if he saw it. We apologize for the vagrancy but there is nothing good to say about it, because it seems that someone has taken a video camera and films this .. this .. disaster thing. Uwe Boll your films are no longer on my list of the worst movies ever this has taken the cake. <br /> <br /> Sorry I could not explain the plot (if there was one) but that was the best I could. Now if you don't mind I'll go crawling in a corner and go back and forth and remember how bad it was for this movie that scared me all my life ... OK, not for life
