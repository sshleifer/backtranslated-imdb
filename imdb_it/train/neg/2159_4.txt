Well, it's Robin Hood as "geezer", okay ... just as advertised! It didn't look very hopeful, and alas, it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> A Ladin I can take; a Robin who tangles with the daughter of a dyer whom I can credit; but a Robin who exchanges not very funny jokes with his only henchman is more difficult to digest, and a Robin and * the whole cast * who seems to have difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of destiny. How can you let such a tiring delivery pass without repeating the scenes? Again and again, it sounds like he's struggling with semi-understanding Shakespeare rather than letting go with a salty joke; I was hoping from the beginning that it was just a failed comic trait in a character clearly intended for the role of comedian, but then started to spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say the most about Errol Flynn in the role, he has had the ability to offer high-level dialogues as if he had just thought of everything at the moment ... and as this production shows, it is not at all as easy as it sounds! If they were going to play the characters like cheeky chapies, the actors in question would have had appropriate lines: they sound like they had no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid I didn't even like the sheriff of pantomime, for a similar reason; the lines are clearly not meant to be taken seriously but delivered (and in this case written) with a push and a wink to the public. I'm out of place, stuff from the fourth wall, but it's not that funny. <br /> <br /> This much promised production reminded me of a limping school game. The only actor and character to whom I felt a certain appreciation was the one who played Guy of Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have some tampering (a) credible evil and (b) credible characterization - but frankly, I wouldn't have said I it was a very good wish for the future of the series! From the moment I write, I will give another hint in the hope that things will improve and fall asleep a little later next week, with fewer set designs required and perhaps the actors more comfortable with the dialogue: after all, the "Doctor Who" opening episode was not exactly a show-stopper, although it was not at all as bad as this. But if I see no improvement after episode 2, I fear that the series has almost certainly lost a spectator. <br /> <br /> It would be a shame, because I have a soft spot for "Robin Hood" "The legend on screen, from the adventures of Douglas Fairbanks to the robust addiction of Richard Greene. But this Robin can't mix my blood in the minimum.
