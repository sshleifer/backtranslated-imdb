A low-cost effort from Texas that has at least turned out well, but this is little consolation. Bad acting, or, I should say, bad acting, a rather soft plot that is nothing new, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. It seems that a group of young people are putting together a haunted house for Halloween, which is performed every year, but this year things are different. It has a long lesbian theme that is not only annoying, but it certainly fills the empty spots, of which there are many. Putrid, childish, definitely avoidable, at all costs.
