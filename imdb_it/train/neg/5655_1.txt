Egyptian films have a lot of movies with a high level of drama or romance or comedy or even sports action ... "Ziab the Ta'Kohl AL lam" was banned in Egypt because it contained nudity (full frontal female nude) and this guy Of Nudity is forbidden in Egyptian films .. When I saw this movie I felt down ... Stupid hero .. Nude actress .. Bad action .. Some horror and horrible colors .. Dear friend .. If you want to see a great movie egyptian ... Simply: Stay Away Form "Ziab la Ta'Kohl AL lam" .. We have great movies in Egypt ... We have a great actor who won a Global Wins like: Omar El Sheriff or Gameel Rateb .. We have great directors like "Yousef Shahin" So believe me Pall ... You don't need to see this movie ..
