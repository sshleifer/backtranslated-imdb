I don't remember seeing another mysterious murder / film like this. This film, about a medical examiner investigating the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a noteworthy TV station for low-budget movies and TV shows like this one. TV movies, of course, don't have the limit factor or suspense as a big screen movie. But this film has certainly struck every bitter taste. The creators of this film have missed the opportunity to make "Receipe for Murder" a great TV movie; the title offers some suspense. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. Only this film can kill the TV appetite. <br /> <br /> Vote F
