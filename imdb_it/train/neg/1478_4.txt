this film has its good strengths: sexy people die of people <br /> <br /> the problem ... the barley hot Chicks strips and many people are not seen dying, mostly just a lot of fast movements and screaming even though there were two good killing scenes. <br /> <br /> even for those of you who watch this for JENNA JAMESON she is just a part of charlatan with a very small role and minor nude scenes. <br /> <br /> What this film needed ... screenplay and story would be nice but I'm not complaining about this .. I just say it needs more nudity and better kill scenes for us to make it look because that's why we watch these films ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't want to waste my money on it ... and if it's necessary, wait for it to be on the OLD shelves in your local video store
