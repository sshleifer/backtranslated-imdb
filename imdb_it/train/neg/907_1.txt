I wrote a review of this film further down after buying it on DVD and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I tried looking at it again after reading some of the comments made since then. Being a film student and making budget-like films (ie without a budget, shot on digi cam), I support my original comments. This is a student project without budget (and not particularly good), published in video / dvd to look like an award-winning film (if you read the cover). So deconcentrate the public into thinking that it is something that it is not. I want my money back under the job description deed! Complete garbage!
