I gave this movie a 2, and although I consider myself a fan of science fiction, I found this film very difficult to take seriously. He was on AMC late one night and I'm glad I saw him for free. This film is probably good for some laughs, but not much more. <br /> <br /> The special effects are average for the time period - not terrible, but not exceptional. Obviously we now know more about Mars than we did in the past, but we can't really keep it against this movie. The main reason I didn't like this movie is because of the story. <br /> <br /> There were several parts of this film that I wanted to be explored in a somewhat more detailed way: the astronaut's injury / condition, the city on Mars, the creature in the lake, etc. . Overall, the film is very similar to a long episode of the 1960s version of The Outer Limits - complete with an approximate ending.
