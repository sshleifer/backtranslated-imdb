.... And after seeing this pile of shit it won't surprise you that it hasn't been published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a terrible film for all standards, but when I point out that it is one of the worst films that has Stephen King's name in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is. The film begins with two characters staring at a scene of horror: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened here?" <br /> <br /> "I don't know, but I'm sure I hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The cameras look out of a house where hundreds of cats are hanging to death and mutilated. Boy this guy is right, someone hates cats and with a deduction like that he should be a cop. Oh wait a minute, he's a cop and when a movie starts with a cop who makes such an obvious observation, you just know you're watching a bad movie <br /> <br /> The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it's very illogical and confusing. Eventually we will discover that the title monsters need the blood of virgins to survive. Wouldn't they be looking for a virgin in the middle-west Bible belt rather than in an American coastal city? That said, at least we know the motives of the monsters: this is the only thing we learn. We never learn how they are able to change shape or are able to make cars invisible and this jars with the ending that seems to have been stolen from THE TERMINATOR. The mother of the monsters goes around killing several policemen with their bare hands or blowing them up with a police gun (!), But if her monster race is immune to police firepower, then why do creatures need to change form or become invisible? The end of the creatures is equally ill-conceived as killed by a mass attack of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats, then why don't monsters kill all the cats that lie in the garden? There was a whole host of dogs sitting around but the monsters never thought of killing them. I imagine it is so that the production team can reach a final. This is how the film started, my complaint is <br /> <br /> We have been treated in several scenes where famous horror film directors like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos. I think the reason for this is that every time an unknown actor read the script, they immediately decided that, no matter what, they wouldn't look so bad in a movie so Stephen King had to call his horror friends to fill in out of the cast. Here's how bad SLEEPWALKERS are <br /> <br /> * Incredible as it looks like it's not the worst line in the movie. The worst thing is - "That cat saved my life"
