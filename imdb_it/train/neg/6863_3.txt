oh my god, I give this movie three out of ten stars for the following reasons. the final sequence is once again effectively managed and it was absolutely fun. this is what he gets for those three points. apart from that, it was atrocious. he didn't want to be so funny, so obvious, but the dubbing, the recitation of the supernatural voices, the dialogue they said, where often amusing. actions performed and / or not performed also lead to much hilarity and / or launching objects on the screen. like when the whole city is massacred and a small group of people is on a balcony looking as if they were looking at a kitchen glass, or the "attempted" escapes from the church where they hide. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: I think something is happening outside, so you should go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> hero: ok. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: now is my chance to bring out an idiot and get excited with the fire being totally ineffective and engraved. <br /> <br /> enter the sequence in which it occurs. <br /> <br /> evil mayor: damn, wait, I'll take this little baby and she'll walk outside and cry crying apparently obvene the fact that those rotten corpses are not only ghostly strangers but are actually zombies without skin or skin or anything and he will lead them away and I will flee! enter the sequence in which this occurs. <br /> hero (above): is trying to escape again, crazy, and left the door open, it's silly, this is a beautiful sight. <br /> <br /> woman: where is my daughter? <br /> hero (downstairs now): I don't know, I can't see her anyway and she wasn't out because I couldn't see her even though she was out you and I have a vision of the whole neighborhood and her is standing right outside, where the hell could it be? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Needless to say, anyone would throw things on the screen after 10 minutes of this. so watch the first movie with a couple of friends, drink some drinks and make sure that the moment you come to watch this, you're absolutely drunk blind and you can just laugh at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even a good blood, a shame.
