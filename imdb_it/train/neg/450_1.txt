This show is painful to watch ... <br /> <br /> It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, from the "jobs", the boyfriends and the cast that are constantly changing. It looks like they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but they had no idea what, and they invented this lousy show. They launched her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty-three thirty-year-olds, and put her in mostly adult situations to repeated failed comedy attempts. Soon, they realize that he needs a "clique" and throws people between 20 and 20 years old to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> The way this show has survived four seasons is beyond me. Somehow, the ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show, and threw it in its afternoon lineup on ABC Family.
