This is the worst movie I've ever seen and with the exception of "They saved Hitler's brain", the worst movie I've ever seen. When this movie came out, I was a big fan of SNL and SCTV and so I was anticipating what I thought would be the funniest movie that could be produced since it didn't have the restrictions that improvised TV shows had to face. <br /> <br /> The writers must have thought of throwing a little coarseness, some jokes of flatulence, some cheap sex and hey we have a risky side that divides a laughable comedy. The skits of the game are nothing more than economical and unimaginable take-offs on Let's Make a Deal with coarse stupidity. The sitcoms take off involving the single girl and her boyfriend was just bad school wit. The announcement of the stun gun was the appropriate humor for Seasame Street. The Los Angeles Metro scene was a bland humor that used tasteless blood. The French chef who goes around blind saying "there is no difference" with a French accent was, well, you understand my point. <br /> <br /> The only funny skit involved Chevy Chase which lasted for a full minute. That means you'll have 60 seconds of fun in this movie. Oh yes, I read the comments on the whole country that was stoned in the 70s and you'll like this movie if you're tall. Well, most of the country was not stoned in the 1970s. If the inept writers had been stoned, he must have been subjected to sleepy breast medicine. There were 4 other people in the theater besides me when I saw this movie. Obviously the word has not yet come out of how bad the film was.
