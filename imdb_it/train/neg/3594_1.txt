This is not a horror movie, but a boring sex movie. A very bad film, to be avoided by a serious horror fan. No plot, horrible acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer you will know enough ... It's a shame that this thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies not available. If you like vampires try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic by Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this junk. Rating = even "1" is too much! And believe me, I'm not the only one with this opinion.
