In 1692 Salem, the lies of a sneaky child concerning a slave's involvement in witchcraft sends an entire community into turmoil. The costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not formal, although it is not a vivid representation of contagious hysteria. Worked by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King), the elements of the story are quite interesting (especially those coming out of Hollywood in 1937), although to anyone who has read "The Crucible" by Arthur Miller, the acclaimed the melodrama on show here will not be tolerated for a long time. The biggest problem with the image may lie in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are a pair of battered lovers hampered by witch hunts, MacMurray is too contemporary a presence for these environments. * 1/2 from ****
