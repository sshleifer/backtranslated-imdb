Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of all kinds. Minus the fangs, of course. They are dark and bitter creatures who have nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their fascination (ie a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) seduce desperate souls, who continue to torment and victimize. This is more or less the basis of this black comedy, as I understand it. <br /> <br /> It is not a mixture of black humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience that supports the squalid, main character. I liked, however, the sound and the melody of the observations of the rapid fire (and presumably very witty). I was very impressed by the strong acting of the cast, in particular by David Thelis; only the character of Jeremy seemed too two-dimensional. Photography and music, both dramatic and gloomy, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really excites me about "Naked" (and the main reason why I would never recommend it to anyone) is the way it seems to repeatedly present misogyny as a valid way to vent its anguish . In other words, in a world that sucks so badly, what difference does it make if you inflict pain on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this site) that Johnny is not so rude a person because he is not so hard on girls like Jeremy, it seems to me completely absurd. They are both terrible and bad people. And they are particularly interested in hurting women whenever they have the chance. It could be argued that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly came back and bit him in the ass. However, the sadistic behavior of Jeremy and his son is treated to a certain extent by a laugh. And I could be wrong, but I guess most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the movie darkly comical.
