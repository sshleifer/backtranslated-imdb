This film is a parody, and is not suitable for keeping the company of the original superior. The plot is an absolute disaster and the film is too long. Whenever they are struggling, they desperately inject a sentimental reminder of the first movie. <br /> <br /> "Gregory's Girl" is one of the 10 best British films of all time, this is terrible.
