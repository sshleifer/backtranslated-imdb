This could be a nice movie for kids. My nephew looked at him once. he looked at him a second time I was looking at him a little. <br /> <br /> When the little bear gets lost on the ice and he is in the water, he is trying to reach a piece of ice he says "Come back stupid ass". <br /> <br /> I don't want my 3-year-old grandson to watch movies with words like this in it. <br /> <br /> That's why it's rated for children. It should be suitable for children. This is what I would expect. put out by the Warner brothers and G evaluated I would expect this to have no rude words in it. Words don't even fit the movie in most places, as it seems added later. And the film drags on in many parts.
