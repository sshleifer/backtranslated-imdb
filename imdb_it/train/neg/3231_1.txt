This film seems to have many people saying that it is one of the most brutal of all time. Having just seen it, I can say that it does not live up to these claims. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is really insane. But overall, the execution was by no means worthwhile. Even the final scene (the thing of the eyeball) is not so bad. I was expecting something crazy, instead it was of lower quality than a gore staged on films like the very low budget Violent Sh! T. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed, since it is not a story of any kind (although most people certainly know it). Gore fans will be disappointed because, contrary to popular belief, the blood and guts here are few and far between. Not to mention the actress who plays the victim could be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Regardless of what people say, this film is not so shocking, it is simply something that sucks. Avoid it.
