An extremely boring drama starring a very young Roddy McDowall, who trains a wild horse, the title Flicka, and is the only reason to watch the film in the first place. Coated in music at full blast and oppressive and weighed down by Schmaltzy's dialogue, this is one of those endless films that bore you to the point of giving me a headache. The sequel entitled "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka", in which McDowall trains the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original, but the pace remains slow and the score continues to punch you, even if there are at least one or two scenes that do not induce a coma.
