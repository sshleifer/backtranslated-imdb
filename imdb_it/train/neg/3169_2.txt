This film is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has talent and the only one who is not annoying. I've never seen Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie it was horrible. It's like she doesn't know anything about acting. His whole character whines all over the movie, and she can't make the b **** and be funny. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion and it's like looking at the check papers while reading them. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's so cutter. Go from point A to point B with little surprise. Much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot should have revolved around her and the things she does as a spirit. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Not worth watching.
