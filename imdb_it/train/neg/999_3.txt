I saw "Descent" last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was a huge disappointment. Disappointment because the plot was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (he seems perverted, I am not!) needless to say very curious to see this movie. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the plot has potential but the dialogues are flat, the actors unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it is a fair representation of the university world in the United States, that the emptiness of the characters has a purpose and all that jazz but makes the whole film not substantial. Just like the scene in which Dawson is raped: he really misses the intensity! I didn't expect an 'Irreversible' style, but still, shouldn't we feel sorry for her? I didn't do it. Not for a minute, it was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that photography was awesome. Well, it's really good, but nothing innovative. I have to admit that the screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the film I couldn't help but think 'I feel I can see the Hell again' in Argento. lol. More seriously, the club's first scene is beautifully resumed and all but I had the bitter feeling of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the dirty bar near the French-Canadian border in Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Io. .. red and blue light, bass music, general lecherous / decadent atmosphere ... No, I couldn't get into this movie. Sin.
