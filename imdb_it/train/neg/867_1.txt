I had high hopes for this film, even though it had a bad review in the newspaper. I was extremely tolerant and sat down throughout the film. I felt pretty bad at the end. <br /> <br /> Although I'm not at all prude or particularly sensitive to bland cinema - I deeply enjoyed both "Everything you ever wanted to know about sex" by Woody Allen. . "and" Funny Games "by Michael Hanneke - I found the directors obsessed with this ten-year-old boy who wanted to drink absolutely disgusting women's milk. And when the film culminated in an orgy where the boy drinks is milk of his mother, both that of the woman who has coveted for the whole film, I almost vomited with disgust for the total perversion and sentimental father that is. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like the vast majority of European cinema , as well as independently made films, so I should have liked this film enormously. Avoid this film at all costs, it should be relegated to the annals of history as a lesson in bad cinema.
