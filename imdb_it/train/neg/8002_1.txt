What a terrible movie. The rotten tomatoes also had a good rating for this. do not be fooled by positive comments; It wasn't scary. It wasn't fun. He wasn't smart. It won't even attract your attention. I just wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this crap. the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first few times. after about 15 minutes he no longer enjoyed himself. the dialogue was terrible, it had to be a translation. another negative that stood out was the American idiot. 3 were portrayed and all lacked character, intelligence and judgment. Now I will write a couple of lines to fill this as we have to have 10. The video store employees should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter.
