Speaking solely as a movie, I didn't like it very much. not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as a backdrop for the whole movie, actually that was what kept me from watching it. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it because the acting was dull, his "friends" are all happy and they're crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take on distinct roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never really understood the point! furthermore, the lighting was terrible and I'm just citing technical problems. <br /> <br /> in a nutshell, the film could have only had an "ok I'm out of here!" by some characters. like the lady who doesn't want to hear her version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> on the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of good writing and imagination. I deserve the author of the book for this, therefore, my 4/10. <br /> <br /> so in the end, you hear the story of the man believing it or not, just don't spend all your time acting like you believe him and being shocked by what he says, and at the same time move and make jokes as if you didn't believe him. <br /> <br /> Coherence. <br /> <br /> thanks for reading;)
