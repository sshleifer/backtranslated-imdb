I liked the feeling of the first few minutes of opening, but in 20 minutes I freely applied the fast forward button. Too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from one room to another, down the corridors, through the doors and along the road, and as many shots of him that seem thoughtful and confused. It gave me the impression that the story was initially thought of as a short (20-30 minutes), and then turned into a movie like a love job between the director Grieve and the star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay). > <br /> It might have been more fun if some of the characters had something to say that I hadn't heard in other films before, or if the ending wasn't - disappointing - what I had expected three minutes in the film (atypical for a movie independent / smaller). At least his heart was in the right place - it wasn't your Hollywood instrumental nonsense.
