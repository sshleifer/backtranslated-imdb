for the most part, On Demand offers some rather horrible horror films and offers only other horror films that everyone has already seen and already has an opinion about. It was either this, or Invinicible (I like Mark Wahlberg movies), which I didn't see, and actually I was in a movie watching the mood, which doesn't happen anymore because I've already seen all the movies I own a million of times, and this is a lot of movies, and I don't have much interest in the new films, and boy, did this film make me regret. I'm not going to add any spoilers, I'll just tell you that only a few of the actors in this movie are halfway there. I think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying, but convincing; I'd take her for crazy bitch every day, so she fits her role well, although she's lame. The blood is not so big, just some of the killings, or I could say "wounds" are fine, but not much is seen and there are no body parts in the film to make the wounds more convincing. Towards the end of the film I was pleading with my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a member of the band, even the "recording" parts weren't very interesting, even if what happened would really happen when he was recording. I'm done, if you want to watch it, you're fine.
