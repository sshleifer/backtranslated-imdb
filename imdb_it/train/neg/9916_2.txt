Justin returns home to live with his austere police detective father, but it looks like Dad turned the upstairs into three makeshift apartments, each with bizarre tenants residing in them. Straight-laced idealist Justin is pushed into the world of the occult, of murder, of drinking under age and other vile things. Ho-hum <br /> <br /> Wow, have I seen the same movie that almost all the other reviewers have seen ??? Intelligent, compelling, original, intense, intelligent, brilliant ???? !!? I didn't see any of those things. What I saw was an uninteresting, insipid, banal, extremely obvious thriller, which was as mature with implausibility and without any tension at least as much as the murderer is telegraphed not just in the film while doing his monologue / debate / discussion. And where are these funny and funny moments? I never even chuckled, maybe because I was too busy fighting to not be asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: audio commentary with director Dave Campfield; Second comment with various contributions and isolated pieces of music; 4 featurettes (Making of, on the set, transforming 1 room into 4, and Inside the black circle); Interviews with Felissa Rose, Desiree Gould and Raine Brown; Alternative scenes; Ducks; a music video for "Addiction"; A trailer for this film; And trailer for "Shock-o-rama", "Chain saw", "Skin scan", "Sin", "Bacterium", "Creature from the Hillbilly lagoon" and "Millennium crisis"
