As long as you can suffer! If you like to watch people wake up, get up, get dressed, take a shower, prepare dinner, look at each other, have sex in the dark, then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like tacky apartments, narrow rooms and kitchens , long minutes of silence ... if you like to get bored for two hours, feeling the thrill of "true false intimate art", then you will like it. But if you don't, try seeing a good movie, there are thousands of them. "As long as you're here," but we want to stay? This German film received the award from the Turin gay film festival: Italian journalists still do not understand why the jury took such a negative decision, given that the festival presented many talented films. Maybe be nice to a German, since they often don't get prizes? Well, "The Lives of Others" did ... but this is excellent but not gay. So maybe it's a matter of fashion. Are the Germans "in" again? No matter what? Or maybe just to take a look at some director?
