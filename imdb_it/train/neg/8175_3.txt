The atmosphere of this film is pretty good and captures the atmosphere of the 80s with some good performances. <br /> <br /> However ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run by the mill with the exception of a couple of comic moments and it turns out as strange where I expect it to be destined for be edgy. The characters are totally dramatic, incredible and full of right-wing clich√©s that the writer probably saw watching a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this film does not have a true story. Check all the right "arty" boxes but in reality nothing happens and in the end you wonder what the point was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
