The premise of the film has been explained and if you have come this far you must not pretend to be a film critic. Having said that, my opinion on the film is rather low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike but this goes down in the category of his not-so-great work along with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many). <br /> <br /> The film seems to have a free pass because it is a Takashi movie and nothing about Takashi can be wrong. This is a high school approach to cinema. For the rest of us we will find and an hour and a half of a child screaming without any real reason completely annoying (and yes, this takes away the film), the rhythm of the film reaches almost the levels of rigomortis, and the acting ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If one is a Takashi fan you will see it regardless of your interest. Missing any originality (see the infinite story) or any development of the character from the main character in the face of conflict, but at a rather superficial level. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out, this is the first film to which Miike has been credited as a co-writer, but this does not mean much as not to what we hope may be that Miike's personality will overturn on the screen. All we get are some of Miike's shots by way of the cinematographer. <br /> <br /> The film had the potential to be something big. The premise is not difficult to manage. But this seemed to have been thrown to the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you are approaching Miike you need to have some standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then films in his works such as Blue's Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
