Man To Man tries to be a good film: he has the heart in the right place, he aspires to be epic and has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. But there are also some of the problems with this image. He strives so much to be good and to convey his message that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is enough that the images used by this image are simplistic - Man To Man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but is hammering his message into his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to appear worried, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the only facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the film is too long and loses its speed towards the end, so that we can easily conclude that Man To Man is not worth looking at. But there are enough points to defend it: it's fun, it has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Obviously you shouldn't compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you will leave the theater satisfied. Try to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks it's too obvious) and it works most of the time.
