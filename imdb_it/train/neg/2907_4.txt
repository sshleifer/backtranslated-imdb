He often voted China's biggest film ever by Chinese critics, as well as fans of Chinese films from the outside, and frankly, I don't understand at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, blandly directed and performed, with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (don't laugh) is the shrew, a young married woman who has suffered alongside her tubercular husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. It is the second post-war period, and they live with her husband's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a run-down house with little money (the man had been rich when they got married). Her husband's old best friend (Wei Li) also arrives, who was also his wife's boyfriend when they were teenagers. She thinks of running away from her husband with this man, while her husband remains almost oblivious, thinking he could involve his little sister with his friend. This is the set-up, and it's not going anywhere you wouldn't expect. Actually I saw the remake, directed by director Blue Kite Zhuangzhuang Tian. It still works a half hour, and it's actually a bit boring, but at least it was pretty. This supposed classic is rather intolerable.
