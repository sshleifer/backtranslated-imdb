This is listed as a documentary, it is not, it is filmed as a documentary, but I suspect it was only because then they get away with a flickering video camera and deceptive footage. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as "American Pie style comedy", but it is not. <br /> <br /> Basically it follows a group of teenagers during the spring holidays while they travel to Mexico to drink cheaply and with the quest to get there a virgin friend finally posed. Throw is a couple of dwarves, even in the same kind of research and you have a non-hilarious story of drunk teenagers trying to take some girls. <br /> <br /> Considering the 18 Rating this has very few nudity, and practically zero sex scenes, above all I believe that the vote is by oath of which there is plenty. <br /> <br /> If you like the cruel behavior of Jackass without humor, then this could be your thing, if you have some brain cells left then you probably would avoid it!
