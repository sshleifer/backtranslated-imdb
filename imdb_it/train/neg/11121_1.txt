I really can't understand how anyone can give this disgusting movie more than 1 star ... How do you like a film so retarded, where all the animal abuse scenes are real? I don't even want to imagine the excruciating pain that those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them like that for no reason, or just for money? I tell you, that director is mentally retarded, or he's just a monster with a "heart" of stone. Or both. It really deserves to cut your hands and burn alive. <br /> <br /> It contains horribly barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially to sensitive people and children: a real frog is flayed alive, the fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, the birds are beaten they are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This film is more than terrible; it must be the worst and most delayed film ever made, along with another, called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something like that. I will never watch or buy any movies directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are many great fantastic movies out there, where all the animal abuse scenes are set. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, only a few people liked this is natural, since it is the worst movie ever - so it was not successful. I hope this will make the late director understand that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will never be praised, and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his later films. I truly believe that everyone receives, but what they give! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel "humans" will feel the same pain they inflicted on them. <br /> <br /> However, this is probably my only "negative" review. I don't usually comment on a movie if I don't like it, but this time I couldn't shut up. I had to tell the truth, because animal abuse must stop!
