Is there a movement that is more intolerant and more judging than the environmental movement? For a young socialist in the grass who joins the circus it must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus. Although these people normally entrust their brains to Hollywood for these important problems, the teachings of Hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing. Fortunately Ed is here to teach neo-hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism. <br /> <br /> Here you will learn the art of wagging your face in anyone's face without losing your brand smile. You will learn how to shake off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear. You will learn how to stop any human activity that you do not care for by labeling it as the gateway to planetary Armageddon. <br /> <br /> In addition to learning to lie with a straight face you'll also learn how to shake off the accusations that are diverted to you, no matter how hypocritical you are. You will be able to use all of Al Gore's energy while having people treat you like Amish. <br /> <br /> In the second season it was even more useful as we were able to visit other Hollywood gods, name your saints and verify - that is to say the judge - their lifestyle. NOTE: This is the only time that it is appropriate for an envirofascista to judge another because it allows the victim to buy all kinds of expensive and trendy ecological toys so that they can shake their finger on other people's faces. <br /> <br /> What does reserve us and in the third season? Perhaps he will teach us how to judge while he sleeps!
