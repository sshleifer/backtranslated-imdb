R Balki tries to tell you a story that had been told previously by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time it is mixed with mature moods. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and has Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. I still can't make Hyderabadi Biryani correctly. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu who sends her her Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and who will soon meet and fall in love with each other ?? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 years old. No problem! But a hitch! Tabu's father, Paresh Rawal !! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger for him. And the complications start ?? The performances by all three actors are brilliant. The script of the film is very narrow and interesting. The dialogues of the film are captivating. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not filled properly. Comedy is sometimes not well understood. The film also tries to go long in some parts. <br /> <br /> Musically there isn't much to sing except the title track. Camera work is good. The director R Balki could have given much better from this script. But in the second half he seems confused. The father's "Satyagrah" scene seemed irritating. But the jokes uttered by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are applauded. <br /> <br /> Overall, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar!
