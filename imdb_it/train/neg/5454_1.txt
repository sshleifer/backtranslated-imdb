Wow, this movie was just bloody. So bad that even though I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back. <br /> <br /> The film is about nothing intelligible. It's a mixture of sci-fi clich√©s that have been best made by more experienced directors. The performances, especially the leads, were exaggerated in a less appealing way than Ed Wood. Speaking of Ed Wood, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It is simply too taciturn without any hint of irony or sense of humor. Moreover, it makes no sense, neither the plot nor the lack of. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are ok, but not enough to go "oh wow, it's nice" and they just seem to be thrown in to "be cool" rather than being a good plot device. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was another mixture of things that never created any kind of mood. Again, it seemed that the director was just throwing songs into the film in an attempt to "be cool". <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my final point. Perhaps if the director cared more about the plot, the story and the dialogue instead of trying to be "cool", he wouldn't have made such a lousy click of a short film. <br /> <br />
