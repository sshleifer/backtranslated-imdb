Do we really need other narcissistic rejections in the Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I'm a Boomer, although at the time all the "young idealists" of the 1960s were reading Marx, burning their drawing papers and generally extending a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in elementary school. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just stupid idiots, who would believe everything as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another self-importance exercise by children who have never really grown up.
