Eleven "great" directors, eleven pieces of garbage. Eleven minutes each of pure boredom, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt gives a "hip hip hooray!" for terorism in his amateur segment. Through the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, who uses his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky journalist. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico focused on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn didn't know that there were no buildings in the shadow of the Trade Center on September 11th. Shohei Imamura of Japan who ignores the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial love story and cliché. Ken Loach of the United Kingdom focuses on Chile. Etc. Etc.
