While I recently gave OPERATOR PETTICOAT a positive review, I didn't really like this film despite having so many similarities. Both were made a few years later, both played by Cary Grant and both were comedies from the Second World War. However, the general tone and style of the films were quite different. KISS HER FOR ME, overall, it seemed to me a cheaper film, with poor writing, little energy and some VERY large performances, even compared to the OPERATIONAL PETTICOAT. I think at least a lot of the blame for that lies in the casting of Jayne Mansfield. The combination of his many talents and his limited acting ability has made this film A-budget look like it came from a third-rate studio. Furthermore, there was not much chemistry or energy in combining it with Cary Grant - a generally loved actor for his grace and class. It's a bit like the combination of Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
