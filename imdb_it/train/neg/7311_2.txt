Ok, I had heard little about this movie, so when it appeared on TV movie channels, I wanted to see it, being a horror fan. I think I can make a collective "eh?" for all those who have looked at it. <br /> <br /> I decided to go on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw that it was coming and some of us who had seen it had already decided that we could laugh through it , we both proclaim "this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen". It wasn't scary; I'll give it to Roth (which I think is a young hacker); the characters change during the film, "Cube" wing. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER despite the typical scenario of "caged mice", which will light up on who, etc., was a rather mediocre horror. > <br /> Some points: 1.) What was it with that boy? I'm not even talking about being a strange and biting person. I'm talking about the whole "karate in slow motion that kicks", what was it? 2.) Ok, I know that the character of Rider liked to Jordan Ladd, but as a young woman I was horrified that he had gone ahead and had molested her in her sleep. Uh, this is illegal. <br /> <br /> 3.) Roth was in the film only because Roth could be in the film. Talk about writing me in vain! 4.) What was the deputy? 5.) So it was immediately detached from the dog? And was there little or no blood left? Just a piece of jeans? Anyway we were laughing ass, and I like to laugh during horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I don't know if we should laugh here ...
