Personally, while I'm able to appreciate really good films, I also have a strange ability to enjoy even the most crappy shit. You know, those times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible action movie to shorten the time. This is the only movie I can actually remember that is closing in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of returning to finish it. The plot was so elaborate and predictable, I was gathering the next scene (and I'm usually not very good at it). The actors were horrible, I saw better acting in middle school plays. Even the cuts were bad, the flow was all wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is like a parody that has forgotten the funny.
