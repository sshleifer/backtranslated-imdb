When this show was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago, it would have been something very different for that time. So for some people it would have been pretty scary, and could have been affected by the special effects? <br /> <br /> Looking at the game in this day and age, it doesn't seem to be so scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired. <br /> <br /> Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT in a dark tunnel? I don't think so ...... but if you look at this game again, you will see that the first train that enters the tunnel, runs fast through the RED LIGHT! (maybe that's how it went in time)? <br /> <br /> You will also notice that the path leading to the Signal Box is very steep and in poor condition. Surely there would have been a series of correct steps with the handrails so that the Signalman could rise or fall in the cut. (I can't help noticing things like that) <br /> <br /> I won't take anything away from acting, both Denholm Elliott (the signaller) and Bernard Lloyd (the traveler) have given some wonderful interpretations. <br /> <br /> I'm not at all sure what's going on ... I mean it was the ghost the traveler, or what ??? Does anyone really understand this rather confusing story ??? (well maybe I'm the only one who doesn't) ??? <br /> <br /> To summarize ..... <br /> <br /> The game has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. He suffers from not being so scary these days, and a bit if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual reporting practices .... <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading my review.
