Have the in-laws gone for the weekend? So this is the film to accelerate their departure, failing to induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from the constant annoyance. <br /> <br /> The film is supposedly set aboard a luxury cruise ship, which is more a super-perched car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity list D. An interesting piece of added fun is "Spot the Villain" when passengers join the ship. You are not wrong !!!! With a screenplay that sinks faster than a brick, the clichÃ©s create pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubled as blood this film attempts to understand the genres of thrillers, action films and gore-fests and at the same time fails satisfy none of them. > <br /> A must watch a movie, if only to laugh at how bad it is.
