Ok, just reading the title you might think it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did it. It started well but became so boring after the first half hour. * spoiler * <br /> <br /> It tells a story of a mother who is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader who will do anything to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl on the road. Always wins races, thus pushing the mother further towards "eliminating" her. After talking to a "killer", the mother decides that the girl must be beaten a little. So the actions are taken but eventually captured. <br /> <br /> The cast is horrible and the film drags on too long without anything happening. Don't waste time looking at this. <br /> <br />
