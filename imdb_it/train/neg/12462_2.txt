I saw this movie last night after many positive reviews from many sources. I would like to underline that if you are not ready to try to understand who is who and what it means all this you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For political fanatics and those interested in corruption in other governments of the world, this film is probably quite good, but for the average movie observer this film is embarrassing, very boring in the seats and leave the cinema confused and annoyed by the fact that you have paid the entrance fee. <br /> <br /> watch it if you are ready to focus 100% on every single detail or policy interests you. don't see it if you really like watching movies.
