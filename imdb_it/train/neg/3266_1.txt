When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has escaped with his brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to download his story of misfortune - only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: l effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take care of himself, and many complications follow - including Ben's attempt to make Norman homosexual by fixing him with a prostitute (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description of the film seems much more fun than the movie itself. <br /> <br /> Originally written for the theater by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN ... IS THIS? it was a real disaster on the New York stage. To give the result to the drama, I saw it in the 70s as a community theatrical production - and while no one accused him of being anything other than a superficial farce, the cast sounded so broadly and so casually. which was pretty fun. It is a pity that the cast of this film has not done the same. <br /> <br /> It is a terribly accomplished film. Red Foxx, one of the most exhilarating comics of the 20th century, is fun here as yesterday's wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared in the television series HILL STREET BLUES to a much better effect) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; to tell the truth, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson and a Wayland Flowers cameo have some spark - and unfortunately, this is only compared to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Not only is the film poorly executed, it looks bad. According to the cinematographic tradition, this was the first film on the big screen to be filmed on videocassette, which was then transferred to celluloid for design purposes - and believe me, show. The film looks like a bad seventies sitcom to the skyline painted through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment. <br /> <br /> Some movies are so bad that they become fun, but NORMAN ... IS THAT YOU? he is not one of them. I can summarize my reaction to this film in two words: missing. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. Go back slowly and then run like crazy. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
