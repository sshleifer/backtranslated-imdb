I really like the cast, but the story unfolds rather slowly. Danny Glover does a good job and you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid has not had much space in the story he could have had. I thought the first scene was a bit too harsh compared to how the story unfolded. I would look at it again though. I rated it a 5 (I wish I could vote for 5.5)
