Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director, but imagine what he could have done with this! The plot has a lot of suspense potential. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is thrown against the guy. Nancy Coleman is not a great protagonist but the supporting cast is great and very capable. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to break down soon enough. There are too many coincidences. And an important topic is trivialized by the fact that it has been transformed into something more, in the end, of a love story. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Garfield, Massey and the characters' interpreters. But it's not terribly good.
