my wife is a fanatic regarding this show. Being so I bought her the seasons from one to three and the fourth season is in order. I personally think the show is a big farce that the cast is equally bad. Alyssa Milano should have remained faithful to the other junk movies she did, like Poison Ivy, Embrace of the Vampire, to name a few, the other members of the female support cast are equally inept in their portraits. I've seen better special effects in the old Republic Pictures magazines I've seen as a child. I can understand why the male protagonists stayed on the show for so little time, even if I don't know if it was their choice or not. Please. please don't renew for another season, just enough, Bob
