What should be a simple mysterious plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in reality, a compelling story about a group of characters (the only major actor is Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) that everyone tries to find the murderer in a small cast of residents in an elegant condominium. These characters range from absolutely stupid to mediocre. Like a cheap, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and his guide man (a guy, I don't care who he is because he really sucked) talking about their various possibilities to solve the crime, while being constantly cut off from an absurd detective with his head in the ass. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie like this, and I've seen some real head-slappers. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler didn't do it, because there wasn't a butler. But watch out for the guy who is closer to a butler. You go there. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
