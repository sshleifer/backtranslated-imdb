I can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about a problem like the homeless. Obviously, Brooks didn't make a comedy about the homeless. No mention of drugs, prostitution or violence on these streets. The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasyland so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat often enough. Brooks's films have gotten worse over the years. This is just another nail in the coffin.
