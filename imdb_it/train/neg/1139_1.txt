Note that I haven't seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and not the door. However, I really want to say something about it. Actually I'm doing research for the university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was actually completely different !!! Hollywood's ideas about people and the artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke totally supported hysterectomy to cure insanity in women, and he would never have practiced anything as liberal as depicted in the film. I think it's ridiculous to see various film critics writing for legitimate newspapers who say that this film has a historical basis! The only real fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please don't waste your time in a movie with such contempt for the horror that real women have experienced in the hands of this doctor who has now been glorified by the film industry.
