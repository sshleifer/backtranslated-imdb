OK Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> Obviously I'm lying because it is. I am a conservative but I will leave politics out of my opinion on the film. This film was anti-bush, anti-Middle East, anti big oil propaganda, but that's not why it was bad. <br /> <br /> I punch out I will give credit where the credit is due. I saw this opening night of the film because I really enjoyed this kind of film and I'm an expert in political science in collage. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as I could tell very well. <br /> <br /> The plot was still impossible to decode. I was tested and I have an IQ of 138, but no matter how hard I tried there was no way to put together the plot of the movie and what characters to do what. <br /> <br /> The story and the scene the sequence was totally inconsistent and poorly organized. <br /> <br /> Unless it's one of those movies that is meant to be watched many times to get the full depth of the story, which could very well be, I have no idea exactly what was happening. <br /> <br /> Which makes sense because if you want to have a political discussion and not receive any criticism, then make your discussion impossible to criticize! If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, then bewilder them with Bull S.
