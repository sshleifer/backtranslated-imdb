I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love him. It's one of my favorite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. But this show is good for children, the voices are good (Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the melody of the theme is tolerable and has nice animations. However it is rather disappointing. Normally I don't mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be the main character, he gets annoying quickly. Completed with the catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. Even half of the gang is missing after the first year, somehow he didn't feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and plots were generally limping and unoriginal, very little in search of monsters or exposing the bad guys. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a Clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, the voices, the theme melody and the fact that it is beautiful for children.
