The idea is pretty. Bringing so many stars into a movie is great. But .... too many stories, too short and without any sense. No connection between the scenes. There were 3-4 fantastic stories ... but these were about 18. The frame reminded me of "All invisible children" - a film that I really enjoyed. Compared to it, however, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the intriguing story that develops - it begins and has its end. And the topic that connects all those - the children is missing. I don't find enough Paris an argument to link 18 short drawings together. Perhaps for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it ...
