OK, forget all the technical inconsistencies or the physical impossibility of the Space Shuttle being accidentally launched by an eccentric robot with a heart of gold. Forget the horrible special effects and poorly constructed one-dimensional characters. Just looking at the premise of the story. The real reason why the film will exist in the first place, and you'll see how badly this film was rebuilt. <br /> <br /> I know 9 years looking at this insult to intelligence and they laugh at it. The story is horrible. The acting is comic and the message he tries to show is incomprehensible. And what's worse, is that the cable movie channels KEEP YOU SHOW IT! It's up twice a day every two or three days! Why does someone in their right mind think that people would like to see this painful piece of celluloid several times, much less see it at all? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is not even worth spending the energy to look at this thing. It's not worth it.
