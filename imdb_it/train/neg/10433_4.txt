The fighting scenes were fantastic. I loved the old and new cylinders and how they painted those on their side. It was the ending I hated. I was disappointed that it was land but 150k years ago. But travel all the way only to start over? Are you kidding me? 38k people who have fought for their very existence and once they get to heaven, abandon the technology? There's no way. They were certainly eating paper and rationing food, but it's over. They can live again like humans. They have only one good doctor. What are they going to do when someone has a toothache, it doesn't matter to give birth ... yes right. No one would have made that choice.
