Wow, I hated this movie. The topic should have resulted in a very nice film, and the main actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic, but the script - even if it were * a script - is a disaster. This is less a movie of a random presentation that is not going anywhere. I'd say it's not going anywhere fast, except it's actually the longest 81 minutes you'll ever sit. As I said, the main actor is good. So is Faruza Baulk (SP?), Like his sometimes harsh mother, but ultimately loving and accepting. Filmmakers have a lot to answer here, because this is a mess. Really a pity, because I really wanted to like this movie, but in practice it came out of a movie that was never made. Skip this - it wasn't even worth the $ 6 I paid for pay-per-view.
