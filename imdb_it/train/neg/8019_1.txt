I've read half a dozen other user comments on this forum and it seems that the opinions are very different. I have to agree with those who found this terrible film. It pains me to write it because I would have hoped it would have been great, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day. I like to support independent cinema, especially if they are homosexual, but this film is almost too much to tolerate. Those who came out, as I thought I would do after about three minutes, probably didn't mind shelling out $ 11.00, or just thought it wouldn't go anywhere, fast and it wouldn't improve. Perhaps I am a little more optimistic than I am ... or have not paid to enter the first position. <br /> <br /> Logan is bored. It's a klutz. He is gay. I'm fine with that. The problem is that since the main character of a film is bored, it does not necessarily mean that the film about him should also be boring! There are ENDLESS scenes of this guy who wander around like a load of underwear, re-establishing everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc., etc. Etc. Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. NO ONE says anything remotely insightful or funny or interesting. Probably the most frightening of all is that I haven't felt the slightest bit of empathy for Logan. This in itself is an important achievement. He did not grow up, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he HAS NOT MADE ANYTHING, nor even the film! Scene after scene of the same thing not making a movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the title makes absolutely no sense. 1/10.
