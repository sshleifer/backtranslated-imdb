Anyone who has written the script for this film has obviously never consulted any Lucille Ball book, particularly on his autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biographical film, from his early years in Celoron and Jamestown to his last years with Desi. I could write an entire list of factual errors, but it would go on for the pages. In all, I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone outside of themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I would be irritated by how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers have tried, but the film seems terribly sloppy.
