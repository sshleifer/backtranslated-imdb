This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've ever seen. Just don't stand out at all, really. As for the cards, I thought it would be good enough, but every game didn't seem to match. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the best games. Benoit brought it. I didn't think MVP was fantastic, but Benoit saved this game. <br /> <br /> Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys don't mix. Or maybe it's Khali and any other living person doesn't mix. Terrible game. <br /> <br /> Melina Vs. Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling. <br /> <br /> ECW Originals Vs. New Breed I was excited about this game, until I saw it. Really, really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge Vs. CM Punk Vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB game so far. Just a big disappointment, to many people in the ring at the same time. Simply not up to par. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley Vs. Umaga O.K. not extremely impressive, but not the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> Batista Vs. Undertaker This was perhaps the best match of the evening. Very, very, very nice to see something good to change. <br /> <br /> John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel like this game deserved to be the last one. People make a case for Batista Vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I'm starting to vomit to see Cena win every game though. It's getting a little old. Now, I have to say, I feel that this game is the best of the night, but I'm a big fan of Shawn Michaels, so I'm a little biased. Batista against 'Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so ... I'm sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best games of the evening and most of the rest failed.
