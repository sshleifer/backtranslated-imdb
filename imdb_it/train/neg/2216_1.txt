I'm a B movie lover, give me a genetically mutated bat and I'm in heaven. These films are good for making you stop thinking about everything that happens in your world. Even a stupid B movie usually makes me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead, which was so terrible that I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of the creation of the man-shark, which the film barely touched. In order to keep viewers interested, they simply made sure there was blood every few minutes. During an attack scene the camera detached from the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood thrown by a driver to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (such fabulous special effects). Returning to science, I thought it was very interesting that female test subjects were kept naked and that the test equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. However this film has had a poor development of the plot, a terrible story, and I am sorry to say rather bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker.
