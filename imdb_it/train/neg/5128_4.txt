This first entry into B in the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney in advertisements and posters, but you have to wait for a good time before seeing her, riding a Hollywood camel train. Previously, we founded George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as boys who barely get along, but have to gather in front of the attack. I saw Sanders like so many hilarious cads that it was fun to see a rare good boy. However, Bruce Cabot's fascination is practically a mystery to me - he is basic and unbearable by comparison, but I always felt that he had just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade formation. Some people like it, as does the gypsy character of the gypsy queen. This is an action and adventure filler, and just as we have been warned to invade the locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the British in their land, there is a last firefight in which we must lose a main character for good of all This feature requires nothing more than your slightest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer who made anything better matched. It was almost more interesting to identify the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance of Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. Two or two stars and a half out of five. - MDM
