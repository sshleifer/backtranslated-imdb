This film should have been only 10 minutes. I mean, in this thing there are really only 10 minutes of watchable content (I also hesitated to call it a movie). The film's opening credits were somewhat promising. While the film begins with brief comments about the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more times from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohen's famous songs. The duration of Cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen, whose witty and well-spoken words have already whetted your imagination. But apparently Cave's performance is just the beginning of long super-boring performances, literally a group of people who don't even have the slightest attraction to keep you in your place. I mean what does the director really think? five minutes of close-ups of wanting to be singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What the director really thinks to insult the public by adding "fake applause" to these incessant performances. The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is not a single video from Cohen's past. In fact, with the exception of some photographs of his early years as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks, it may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are presented tortuously little by little between a disastrous camera that captures some of the less attractive people who scream Cohen's lyrics. If you've ever decided to waste your money on this movie, DON'T! throw it in the trash and at least save your time.
