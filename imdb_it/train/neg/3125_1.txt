Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a lonely old dying man who lives in Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his medical friend: "Don't try to cure me, doctor! I'm disgustingly healthy!" Invite his grandchildren to his home and warn them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes brain-beating madness (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br / > Morteval / Karloff ends up dying and the murderous "toys" (designed by his dead brother) start killing relatives. A mini cannon shoots real bullets against a boys face, a life-size knight in armor attacks with an ax and a dancing sheik will stab people with a knife. A boy who is strangled makes hilarious faces. Eventually, Julissa and her boyfriend discover that Karloff is still alive and hidden in the dungeon where the steel gates seal the room. He plays the recurring theme of the organ (a sort of death rattle used for killing), his brother's spirit starts to speak ("The whole house will go with me!") And the villa will go up in flames. <br /> <br /> This senseless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never corresponds to the lips.
