A very modern renovation (sensually handling the fashion) on the story of Dracula (while remaining with traditional customs) with an interesting story of the king of darkness, even if not completely educated. The first time I tried to watch it, I could only do it halfway, before losing interest. Again he starts well (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me he became less engaging when he hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but it never took advantage of its settings (despite the engraving of a cursed paradise, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes, he throws that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it has had its moments with few dream images, but some kinetic changes and economic jolts do not help. The messy script becomes definitely silly. Lussier does a refined job that remains quite glassy, ​​inserting a lot of blood (make-up is properly made) and a lot of "Virgin" advertisements. No, I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, since it comes in numerous shots and even Helsing's daughter works there. Oh, it wasn't obvious to plant. The soundtrack is a fun choice of rock songs. Now the performances are all over the store, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler in the role of Dracula did not break away, for there was not much presence. He was simply overtaken by the succulent women of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. The names of Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably ok. Christopher Plummer gives a grizzled twist while Van Helsing and Omar Epps enjoy his role.
