Wow ... <br /> <br /> I took him to the local Wal-Mart after reading online that he had been released soon. I followed it online for a while, and just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> I think the thing that really struck me was the change, or the lack of. From time to time, the characters (usually the Narrator and whoever is with him) are shown walking ... and walking ... and walking. I'm not a publisher, but I know you can cut between someone who leaves point A to show him getting to point B. There's no need to show almost the whole trip! Wow ... <br /> <br /> I ended up feeling a little sorry for the actors involved in this. It seems that they were given no indication of what to do during the scenes except to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Because it was decided to do almost all the effects using the CG is beyond me. Even ILM still sometimes uses miniatures. One of the most shocking uses of the green screen in this film is the constant search for (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing citizenship of different cities and towns, including London. Sometimes these people come and go without regard to the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera. In a scene in London, there seem to be at least two men over six feet tall who walk right behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracted mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG did I see such a fake piece of hair on my face. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Because Timothy Hines talked about this film like he did outside of me. It's a simple and simple turkey. On the positive side (at least for me) he provided some of the most genuine loud laughter hilarities I have seen in quite a while.
