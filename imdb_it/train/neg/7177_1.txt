Being that I loved the original "Caligula" even with all its flaws, I must say that this remake trailer was abysmal. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich saying in that lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick The set doesn't look like Roman at all ... it looks like a Hollywood movie of a rich actor, and the Roman costumes seem cheap shit that you buy in a costume shop in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> What a "fascinating" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman totally terrified by her mind, as if she didn't know it's a movie trailer. <br /> <br /> Acting must be among the worst I've ever seen, with most of the lines I feel like casual actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" the loudest and annoyingly annoying possible. <br /> <br /> Casual sex scenes have also filled a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and scenes with noteworthy actors / actresses like Gerard Butler (who scratches the screen in shadows for all three and half a second) do nothing but appear uncomfortable or freak out with their minimal lines, simply dragging them down with the ridiculous delivery. <br /> <br /> Courtney Love's part consists of her that looks like the usual lousy idiot who leans against a door muttering on the moon or something. It cannot be said why she is drunk or tall or only mutters in an idiotic way. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... laughing at random, and screaming in a way that irritates you. <br /> <br /> Helen Mirren ... was in the original, and her return to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" In particular "I love" (and with love, I mean hate) the beat of Ennia, "Caligula ... j00 no maki me * something inconsistent * .... * something that seems to be jerky *" It is also madly arrogant to say that four of Caligula the realm of this year was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this was the worst, the most unbridled, self-indulgently arrogant piece of shit labeled as " art "that I have ever seen. Even if Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he wouldn't have to show up or give his name for this pile of shit, no matter how much they paid (unless it was a billion billion yen). The worst trailer ever.
