I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy movies. A couple of them weren't bad. Modern film critics are not the ones who usually prefer good and bad films, so quality shoe films like these are rarely praised. Nevertheless, I cannot defend this film either. You can still have a dated dialogue, but laugh and cry about the story. Looking at this, shake your head and ask yourself, "How stupid are you getting?" This is more horny than banal, if you understand what I mean. It's so trivial that I can't imagine that too many people have actually passed for the entire hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of the jam because he makes up a story about how to deal with a debutante from New York City as if it were the best. People were much more attentive to social problems in the old days. You would hear the term "social-climber" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest result you could have made it. It is absolutely absurd, of course, and even more so today. <br /> <br /> However, it is as innocent and clean as a story and a series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy films made) as you might find. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket while singing a few songs here and she creeps into his heart. Oh man, I almost vomit even writing about this!
