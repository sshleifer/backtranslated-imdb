I was about 7 years old when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a film was released. In the UK it was advertised on TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were an incredible hit movie. It was actually the first movie I ever saw in the cinema, and I was discouraged for years to come. The following week I was invited to go see the new movie "Star Wars" and I refused. I've never seen him before, as a protest against watching Sasquatch! Seriously, even at 7 I could say that I was looking at the garbage. It's so ugly, it's almost unbelievable. An absurd nonsense that would NEVER have to come to a cinema. However, I have been amused reading all these years after the director has never directed, as far as I'm concerned. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
