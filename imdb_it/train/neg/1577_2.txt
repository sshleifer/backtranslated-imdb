This classic tale of smoldering 1997 reached its deserved legendary status as one of the greatest sagas of a condemned and hopeless love. The pervasive, continuous, and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and her name is sure to resonate the hearts of many spectators with memories of their first crush. The brilliant script dangles this embryonic future in front of the kidnapped audience, sitting pierced while abstract, almost expressionist, cinematography focuses deeply on desires just below the surface that reflect and flow among the principals. You can cut the sexual tension with a boring tire iron. <br /> <br /> A small drop of sweat on the tip of a nose captures the shining sun and leaves no doubt as to its meaning. Scenes like this abound and continue to be observed again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (to which this masterpiece is often compared), the close-ups of the faces of the actors as they experience the slow dawn of the great love-that-do-not-not-will-haunt you forever. <br /> <br /> The now classic RC soundtrack, with its creative and unique use of the solo synthesizer, emphasizes the emotion that drips like a leaking base. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism altogether mentioning what I consider a minor flaw (and I dared to risk the anger of the millions of fans who hold this classic so dear to their hearts), I would say that the hallmark of "Runaway Car" - his sense of sexual tension assembly - is briefly broken by the highway scene, which now after repeated visualizations seems only a little too long (and probably not even necessary?) To the eternal, bittersweet story of interrupted love. <br /> <br /> I dare to advance what I perceive as the smallest of the flaws in this triumph acclaimed by the criticism of modern cinema? 'Citizen Kane' had its 'rosebud'. . . Even the "Runaway Car" should have its password. Perhaps the film could have opened with an extreme close-up of Judge Reinhold, saying something like "A car is an extension of its owner!", And the rest of the plot could therefore be devoted to analyzing every syllable, subtlety and nuance of that sentence. If that plot had been made, this film could have passed "Titanic" at the Golden Globes that year, I am convinced. <br /> <br /> My only regret? Which I didn't read the novel before.
