I liked "American Movie", so I rented Chris Smith's first film, which I thought was also a documentary. In the first minute I saw that it wasn't, but I gave it a shot. <br /> <br /> What a movie with no output. Being faithful is of no use if you are simply going to examine boredom, especially. boring, but we have become an important thing for ANYONE who 1) a lot of jobs suck and 2) many of them are disgusting, minimum wage work in the service sector ??? I knew it before seeing the film. In reality it was not however an examination of this, since while the film struggles to feel "real" (portable video camera, no music, etc.), what is happening hardly takes place as in the "real world". <br /> <br /> An employer would be so cheerful with Randy when he takes his check, after Randy has resigned from him after 3 days when the boy said he expected him to stay 6 months ?? Or the day after he quit his job (and ruined the machine he was working on), that everyone would be so easy with him ?? <br /> <br /> A big problem is our "hero" (?), Randy. This guy is a loser. Not because he's stuck in these jobs, or has a poor apartment, or looks like one. It's a drug. Do not pay attention or even really try these jobs. It has zero personality. If you hire someone, you won't be able to pass the interview. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to see what Chris Smith will do, but guys, knock down "this-is-an-" important films "." American Job "doesn't work.
