Dahmer, a confused young man. Dahmer, a confusing film. Sure, I drank some beer while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why I got so bored with this movie. <br /> <br /> His flashbacks are nothing more than confused and annoying, and there is no real plot with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the film was the explanatory text at the beginning and at the end of the film. The inbetween stuff, which would be the film, is just boring images and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see real murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you just get the feeling that Dahmer is dreaming the whole thing, but you know it isn't, since it's based on a true story and this actually happened, at least for the most part. But what happened? It is not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I don't encourage people to waste time on this movie. To me <br /> <br /> didn't like it a little and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
