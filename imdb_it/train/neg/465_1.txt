When I was in the cinema the other day, I gave up on Blonde and Blonder, but something seemed to be a nice movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure many people have beaten Romy and Michelle before seeing him, Blonde and Blonder may have been just another secret treasure that has been handed down. But when I started watching it: executive producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was afraid of something. Not only that, but both of those that were considered the pinnacle of spiciness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging at all and are playing roles that I think were more thought for women than they should be among 20 and 40 years old. The story was simply bad and hateful. <br /> <br /> Dee and Dawn are your stupid stereotypical blondes, they really have no idea what's going on in the world, it's just sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their story and in reality they are calling the genes of the girls because of their "ignorance is bliss". They are set to make a "hit" on a boy, and they think they are going to "show him a good time", but the real killer is furious and wants the case and kill the girls. <Br /> <br /> Denise and Pam seem really embarrassing on the screen and almost as they read the script the day before. I know this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went hateful and wasn't necessary. Would I ever recommend it? Not a million years from now, girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as "sexual kittens", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. <br /> <br /> 1/10
