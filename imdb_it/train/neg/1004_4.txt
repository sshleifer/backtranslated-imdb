The Jewish journalist Justin Timberlake (like Joshua "Josh" Pollack) is puzzled when a court defender whispers "Thank you" to testify the officer LL Cool J (as Rafe Deed) while leaving the witness stand. In the opening sequences of this film, you are given the explanation. You will see Dylan McDermott, the devilish detective companion of Mr. Cool J (like Frances "Laz" Lazerov), decide NOT to kill Damien Dante Wayans (like Isaiah Charles). The policemen of the city of "Edison" are so corrupt that they shoot their suspects, steal their money and snort their drugs. If he's out to impress his girlfriend (here, called "Pussy") or to win a Pulitzer, city corruption DOES NOT fit the noble Mr. Timberlake well. <br /> <br /> Timberlake decides to investigate corruption, which reaches both unexpected and life-threatening danger levels. Writer / director David J. Burke holds the film over water, but barely. LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the "pop star to movie star" lotteries (or "rapper to actor" progression). Mr. McDermott is having fun with his role. The merit of the loan to the trial is wisely supported by actors Morgan Freeman (as Moses Ashford) and Kevin Spacey (as Levon Wallace). BROTHERHOOD. means First Response Assault and Tactical, but it is more important to know that "Edison (Force)" sees Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J as protagonists, not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey (who seems lost). <br /> <br /> ** ** Edison (9/17/05) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake, LL Cool J, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott
