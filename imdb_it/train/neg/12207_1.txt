I remember loving this movie when it came out. I was 12, I had a Commodore 64 and I loved playing Rambo on it. I was really excited when I bought this really cheap movie. I put it in my VCR and started: Man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the whole film (except for that terrible sentimental speech at the end), and he has the same expression on his face all the way. And that stupid thing of love in the middle is simply so surprisingly predictable. I just finished running the whole thing and went to swap the movie for something else.
