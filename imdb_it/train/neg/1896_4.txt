This film shows us nothing original. Any idea or scene (action) can be found in many previously published films. Fabulous Nick is completely clear here. Even Will Patton is calm and evil, nor good. Mr. Duvall is ok, but he has a very small part. So Angelina, then, how can we determine her newly acclaimed celebrity? Overall, there are too many characters, so that nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes the film easy to forget. Too bad, don't you think?
