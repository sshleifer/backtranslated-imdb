I read "EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES" by Tom Robbins as a teenager. I loved every word. He was sexy, funny and full of glamorous landscapes and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I couldn't believe what was a boring, acid, joyless piece of junk. How did it happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and stored it under "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the header of the Library of Congress.) Now anyone over the age of 12 who reads the book will know he HAS NOTHING to do with real lesbians, no more than STAR WARS talking about real space travel. The book was obviously - and I mean OBVIOUSLY - written by a heterosexual male who loves the IDEA of lesbians (naked, always), but he never really met one. <br /> <br /> someone in Hollywood said, "uh oh, better give it to a gay director or gay people will create problems." So they handed it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against man, but - no matter how gay he really is - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant has mocked the playful fantasy of a girl / girl without guilt and male voyeurism has turned him into an obtuse and literal lesbian power recruitment poster. It's like turning an Oscar Wilde comedy into a Arthur Miller tragedy. Not beautiful. <br /> <br /> The main clue that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the original material is the crackling cast. His influence allowed him to take on the best. His ignorance of the true subtext of the novel (the fantasy of a straight man, not a gay pride recruitment manifesto) made him make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre. <br /> <br /> We meet the cast of EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Ok, there are few Asian actors of name recognition. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was pretty funny. But launching it as THE CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that the Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't tell him.) Pat doesn't even seem to know that the Chink is. . . well, SEXY !!! In the book it is not the old sage Mr. Miyagi. It's more like Hugh Hefner! She is an old goat and knows a lot about the pleasure of the maiden and sensitive Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. (See, in the book, they are not REALLY lesbians. Do you understand that this is the fantasy of a straight man?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "THE COUNTESS". Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a SERIOUS ACTOR, SHAKESPEAREAN !!!! You need someone who is fun and stands out for this role. For John Hurt to be chosen as a madman like the Countess is tragic and sad. I kept waiting for Paul Scofield to wander about dressed as Thomas More and shake his head sadly. "Now, Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. In shame, my ex-student!" And yes, John Hurt was funny (and rather gay) like Caligula. But that was BLACK humor, not playful and airy humor like the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean". No talent, no training, no problem. Except in the book Bonanza is fun, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film she is grumpy, passive, inexpressive and boring. As for her taste for women, Robbins puts it this way in the book. "God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man who fits." Uh, Gus? Did you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a difficult role. In the book Sissy is really an unusually passive and timid heroine. However, a more skilled actress may have produced a twinkle in her eyes, or a swing in her walk, to imply a sort of hidden force or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. Uma doesn't take it out, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy should enjoy being a hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. Uma sounds more like she's in a TV movie about a girl dying of leukemia. <br /> <br /> This film is harsh and boring. And I accuse you, Gus Van Sant!
