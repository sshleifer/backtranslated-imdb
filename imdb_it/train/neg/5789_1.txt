My wife and I had really high hopes for this film, but it was a big disappointment. It was a native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails in everything he feels eg. fishing, hunting, obviously, subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process they lie to his son numerous times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how ugly this film is. The children and the wife are very real and this makes the film even sadder. I don't understand humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people who make fun of themselves. I don't understand how this could have come for the prizes. Save your money, it's not worth it.
