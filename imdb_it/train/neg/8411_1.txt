We expected something exceptional when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway movie staged. The music is simply terrible. There is no memorable song in the film - did you hear any hits from this movie? You won't do it because there are none. Some musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the bathroom and get some popcorn and it was still when I came back! If they were good songs well - but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible development of the character. The protagonist was praised for her way of singing, but it seemed that she screamed every song - it was almost impossible to bear. This film has NOTHING to offer anyone but Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most voted film I've seen in my life. A lifetime of time and money. There is nothing memorable in this film except Danny Glover - which was not quite on the screen and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Rent the video and you will agree: this film was an expensive dog, excessively produced and refined.
