Peter Fonda is so intentionally unnerved as an actor that his line-lachrymose readings cancel out any irony or humor in the dialogue. Swap bad jokes and witty jokes with Brooke Shields as if it were a block of wood with elusive hair; even his smallest touches (like the fingering of a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) do not reveal a character as much as an uncertain actor who is directed by himself, an uncertain director. In the southwest, around 1950, a poor gambler (not above a little cheat) wins a horrible teenager, Lolita, in a poker mess; after taking possession of a treasure map that promises gold in the Grand Canyon, the two quarrels become seekers. Some enchanting views and a strange but interesting cameo by Henry Fonda in the role of a grizzled canyon man, are the only compensations in the strenuous dramatic comedy, with the two protagonists drawn by cartoonist murderers who will stop at nothing until they get their hands on that map. Shields is very pretty, but - despite the camera loves her sulky and shiny beauty - she doesn't have a screen presence (and her metallic voice has absolutely no range whatsoever); whenever he opens his mouth, one is prone to shiver or duck. * 1/2 from ****
