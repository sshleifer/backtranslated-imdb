Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this movie at the Edinburgh film festival. It was well shot from the beginning, but this is the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was horrible, I wonder if real gogo girls were hired? But it was the plot that was really ridiculous, in fact it was ridiculous and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler below **. <br /> <br /> I just want to mention some of the scenes that made the audience laugh: <br /> <br /> Pushing the girl on the field: who would have thought that a child pushing another boy could act so badly. A true revelation. <br /> <br /> The scene on the bus: the girl gets on the bus. But, according to the music, the world is ending. <br /> <br /> Rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this really shows the ability of the writer of the plot. In the room, followed by raw meat and selling skills. Why not just have all three "sins" performed at the same time? At least then the film could have been slightly shorter. <br /> <br /> Running down the stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls takes off down the stairs chased by a meat that eats Dau, without waiting. she * is * walking fast trying not to break her nails. <br /> <br /> The race covered in blood: this is definitely my favorite scene, and a perfect conclusion to the film. A half marathon in red paint, completed by the vaulting up the stairs and over the bridge, only to be unrealistically sent from a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is undertaken by the most obsessed girl in the film, now that she sticks to the character for you. <br /> <br /> I would like to think that this film has been created for 16 years old and mates. Unfortunately, having met the director at the presentation, this is not the case. <br /> <br /> But, if you are in a sarcastic mood, and imagine you are laughing with some companions .. then still not even thinking about it.
