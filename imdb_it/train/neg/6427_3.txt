so overall I found this strange and really useless documentary. I know he has prizes and things, but personally I didn't like it very much. there was no humor or drama in it to get you interested, just a bunch of wierdos and their work. some people are quite different, which is not a bad thing, it just didn't leave me a good impression. I was completely bored by this film, without offense for my creative writing teacher. the theme of the circus throughout the film was pretty good, but I didn't understand it, and robotics and lion taming are not my thing. the green animal thing was clean, I loved the colorful flower gardens, but how did these four works connect? it just didn't make sense to me because someone would make a film about it. But if you like things like that you could enjoy them. who am I to stand in your way. I'm just warning you of possible suffering.
