At first glance, this should be a great film, a great cast, a plot with many possibilities and one of the best Hollywood movies behind the camera for the first time. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear why it was another 8 years before Spacey decided to try again to direct a film. This film fails on so many levels. In a movie where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of places, it is imperative that the suspense and continuity be provided by the director. Not so, the cast is horribly underutilized, none more than the great John Spencer, the plot is so run by the mill and nothing that you haven't seen in hundreds of other TV movies. There is so little development of the character that you end up not worrying about any of the protagonists. At least we know that Spacey has a lot of comrades and influence in Hollywood studies to get away with such a poor movie
