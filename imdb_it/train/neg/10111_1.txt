A horrible acting, a bad story, a bad trick, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I've never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes when I decided to go ahead to see if something redeem would happen ... It didn't happen. (Apart from a nice blow to the breast) The film apparently was shot in a furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets. You can also see this same red chair in different "locations" If you are going to make a movie, at least rent an office building and an apartment, not a warehouse that will echo all of your actor's dialogue .. (Note to producers) Renting a small office and apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are a little more versatile and credible. If you spend your money to rent these people, I hope you got a return guarantee ... I'll ask for your money back ... I spent only $ 2.99 to rent tonight and I feel robbed.
