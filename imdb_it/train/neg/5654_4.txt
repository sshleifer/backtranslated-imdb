I never heard of this film until it appeared as part of a Robert Mitchum retrospective at the National Film Theater in London. Almost 60 years on the cast list seemed to be nothing short of tasty with seven names - in addition to the Mitchum with the highest beak - in the public domain; Charles McGraw, not far from The Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, long before Dallas and probably even better known as the designer Norman's daughter Walter Brennan, who needed no introduction, Frank Faylen, the sadistic nurse of The Lost Weekend and the much prettier mensch in the small town on It's A Wonderful Life, Robert Preston is still a decade away from Harold Hill in The Music Man with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter composing the numbers. Alas, most of them were wasting time. I searched in vain for some 'signed' scenes as it was the megaphone of Robert Wise. At that point he had made half a dozen films and still had to find a style. The story is our old friend, the war of war, and Mitchum must have thought it was just a cut above the remains of Hopalong's Cassidy on which he would have cut his teeth. There are no new twists - if you don't count the incredible scene when Mitchum accuses Preston of sleeping with Thaxter to get information about his father's plans to move his cattle. This is perfectly true, but how did Mitchum KNOW? We have seen or heard nothing to indicate how he discovered it. On balance, there is not much to say about this.
