You believe in God or you don't. You believe in Jesus or you don't. You believe that He is the Son of God or you are not. The choice is yours. <br /> <br /> The director Denys Arcand has really done everything possible to bring Jesus back to a simple historical figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary, who have again Heaven opened up for us. By encouraging the Big Bang, a world comes from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. The film portrays a theologian who brings some "modern discoveries" to the actor who plays Jesus in the Passion Play, who happily incorporates them into his drama. <br /> <br /> The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the Passion is set. performed in Montreal he has a sexual relationship with one of the Passion players, instead of showing his love for God through celibacy. Most of the time the director's aversion to the Church is clearly visible. <br /> <br /> The director tried to make a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion actor. This is an admirable attempt, but painting the Resurrection with the transplantation of the organs of the actor of the Passion into other bodies means that the director thinks of Jesus. <br /> <br /> My opinion is not important, the opinion of God is, but I wouldn't want to put myself in the shoes of the director and the actors when he finds himself in front of the throne of Jesus.
