I love watching the first color films - do you mean that those clothes from the 40s weren't all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this film. His "eccentric" appearance is actually quite attractive and yes, he has an extraordinary hourglass figure. But I feel that her head has been given enough. He probably developed this characterization on many performances, and no one told her "If it makes you laugh, forget it". She is too joking about when she should be surprisingly down to earth. Madame Arcati's joke is that the mediums were usually portrayed as thin females in long drapes. Arcati behaves like a retired principal (we will really turn our backs!). The contrast between his casual, banal manner and his extravagant beliefs is not really carried out. <br /> <br /> Just because all the actors are English (apart from Cummings), Americans feel they have to use the words "Brit", "stiff", "lip" and "upper". Oh, rest! The three main characters constantly lose their temper and make bold comments (Did he make you love? Yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).
