Like most people I love "A Christmas Story". I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for a good reason: it's horrible. Same local, same narrator, same director but lacked the warm confusion of the original. Charles Grodin was the wrong choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can't imagine anyone able to replace him. History seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the pavilions, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story" Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun looks nice but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the bully of the original neighborhood, was replaced in this film by another boy with suspenders and a strange hat, but with some of Scud Farkus's menacing charm. It would be quite difficult to match the original, even if this film was made with the original troupe.
