this film offers nothing but the most stupid conversations possible. in fact I probably couldn't have imagined how meaningless a movie was, how brief the dialog boxes were until an hour ago, but then I saw this video again. in a film that does not depend on a powerful script, one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and maybe even a little humor, but this film lacks everyone. you heard me miss all of them. there is not a single point that I like about this movie, nobody. I hate it. I'm sure that even anyone will. the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and things, but it does not even succeed in nudity. I don't know how, but I endured watching this for an hour or so, and I definitely recommend you not to do it. the worst movie I've seen in my life. if someone offers to watch it, ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
