Two types of films we like are (1) westerns and (2) films from 30 or 40 years ago. We should have had A Man Called Sledge; BUT ..... <br /> <br /> BUT ... this picture is unpleasant, annoying and stupid from beginning to end. Since there is no one in history (good or bad) to warm up, there is no one who can motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested. No camaraderie among boys trying to steal gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. Sledge has a nice friend, but there's no reason why she insults the whole boy or why she wants to stay in the same room with this pig without an account. <br /> <br /> The film also suffers from a gawdawful intrusion and soundtrack, and from Vic Morrow's bad writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Of the last 30 older films rented by Netflix or Video Vault, this was the fund, the only real disaster in the group.
