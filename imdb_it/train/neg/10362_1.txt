Disney? What happened? I really wish the film was set in the 1960s, like the book. And I could really have dealt with cheap special effects to save the budget for a more accurate adaptation ..... I'm glad that, maybe, someone could be influenced to read the books ..... but, The Man with interchangeable red eyes like IT? And what happens with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was a European version of this film. I really wish I could. I can only imagine that it could be closer to the true story of this poor adaptation. This film must be X'd.
