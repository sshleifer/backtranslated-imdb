Disappointing movie. The performances of the actors are weak. The sets are fine, could have been better. Even the story is weak. The battle sequences are horrible. The sounds and the quality of the film are unkempt. The history of the Kazakh people has been told very badly. This film was supposed to include more Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And it should have also been in the Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Hispanic origins. I don't understand since when Hispanic people play the Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is the shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the best directors in the world. The director of Czekh is excused, since he is not of nomadic origin, he cannot know the true spirit and the history of the nomads.
