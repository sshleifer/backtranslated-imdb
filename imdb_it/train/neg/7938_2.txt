A family in search of some old attractions along the way to include in their father's coffee table book come across an old, decrepit freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family's van breaks leaving the show, they are forced to remain in an almost abandoned fishing camp that has been a prison site for decades. <br /> <br /> There have been many films in the subgenre of horror, ranging from the beloved Freaks by Tod Browning (1932) to "Freaked" (1993) exhilarating by Alex Winter. They are both classic (or future with "Freaked"). 'Side Sho', however, never will be. And if it ever reaches classic status. . . Well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our kind. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the seventeen year old daughter who is obviously older than her natural mother, this film didn't have much to do. The writing was poor, but not entirely terrible. . . boring. The management was poor, and the rare effects of the phenomenon were rather horrendous and unbelievable. The acting was abysmal and the cast was even worse. Anyone who believes the ages of these two camp teenagers must not have met a teenager for a long, long time. There was not enough blood and violence to compensate for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a bit of violence, it was not at all well done. And, I can't forget to mention the final fight scenes that were, quite honestly, some of the worst I've ever seen in a movie. Overall, this is an easily forgettable horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar basket. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
