Yes, you guessed it. Another film in which two identical twins change position. I think now that the Olsen twins are getting older they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like the "Full House" re-runs. If you're going to see this movie, don't do it. Look instead at 'The Parent Trap'. It's more fun.
