Dark Rising is your typical horror / sci-fi / fantasy film, produced very quickly. It has a strange unexplainable pattern with holes so big that we can pass an elephant. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on, but it didn't matter, he was just a demon hunter returning from the hellish dimension to save the campers story with confused stuff added on witches and a book of evil with plot of elements and characters that do not make sense or disappear completely for no reason. The acting is bad but honestly there isn't much they can do with this script that I guess. There are a couple of topless scenes that are probably the only reason this bad movie was made (like so many other bad movies). Take a ride on this unless there is nothing else on T.V.
