This film was o.k. but it could have been much better. There are some spooky moments but there are not enough to make me want to see this movie again. There are some scenes that you can move forward quickly and not lose anything. The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, and this is why I rated it so low. It's watchable but don't expect anything exceptional.
