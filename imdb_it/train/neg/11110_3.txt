I'd just like it to be known, I often don't rate films below 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. His numerous caravans on TV for several months have REALLY made me want to see this movie. So the other night, when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I took some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The plot seemed intriguing to me - a guy is slaughtering unsuspecting people. There is a photographer obsessed with missing persons. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he took and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way to suck you in, even though the plot was highly predictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look behind you" I say, rather bored with the chills to say the least. <br /> <br /> The plot, although predictable, was intriguing ... that is until the end. "This was nice until the end .... Then it was just stupid," says Jack_skellington_freke on message boards. And I fully agree. And here comes the spoilers ... <br /> <br /> See, I was hoping he was a crazy killer, a psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was a secret society that kept creatures alive for centuries. Court. How original. How unrealistic. How boring. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You have had extraordinary films, but this has sunk.
