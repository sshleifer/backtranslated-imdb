I can't understand how anyone can get a budget for such a bad movie. It's as if the TV station was desperate for something, anything. They are buried under a pile of snow, electricity flashes constantly, but magically there is a background light that remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? That and all those stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. Try to create that feeling of emergency and help people. But since it is a bad direction and acting, you will not have your Florence Nightingale solved with this movie, sorry. I join the negative feedback and agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
