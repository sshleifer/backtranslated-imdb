This was disappointing. It started pretty well but, as he went on and lost every opportunity to climb, he fell on his plate. The acting of Maria Schrader is terrible, it never seems to mean what she says, or even to know what she says until she says it. He showed no real emotion, not for his beloved goy or for his mother's story. When with Lena he seemed to have little more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a real relationship between Lena and her mother, except that her mother seemed to enjoy marriage, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's "mixed" love affair and her mother's relationship with her father was a clich√© like them, and failed miserably anyway. The marriage was completely unconvincing and a stupid ending. The climax of the protest was uninteresting, and regardless of what Lena had done or had not done to influence the result, he would certainly have shown some complexity of feelings at that moment, a bewitched look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film has had depth or spark. It was very difficult to take care of any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did he scorn him so on the phone from the hotel? There was no context or explanation for that.) If any reference to him were removed, he would not have been noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story made confused by the poor development of the character (who was whose mother, again ??) weak acting, and director who made everyone look as if they were acting. You could almost hear "silent on set! ...." I started thinking that this was worthy of a 7, but as the movie went on it quickly dropped to a 4, then earned a 3 after the stupidity of the wedding scene . This film was a cold and sterile film, as I've seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
