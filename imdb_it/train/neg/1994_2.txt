This film, originally published at Christmas, 1940, has long been lost. A very poor copy has re-emerged and turned into a CD, now for sale. Don't buy it! The film is unspeakably terrible. The casting is poor, the script is horrible and the director is terrible. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young sings and dances. And this was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie was deliberately lost.
