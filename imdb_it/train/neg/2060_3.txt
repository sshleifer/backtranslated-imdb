A repressed housewife (a boring Dickinson anxiety, whose double body treats / listens to us with an extreme close-up of her delicate) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to expand. This translates directly into a series of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute (Nancy Allen, clearly they are in the wrong business if SHE can take home $ 600 a night) and her psychologist (Michael Caine). If you're going to see De Palma screw (excuse me, "pay tribute to") Hitchcock, look at "Sisters" instead of this one. "Dressed to Kill", despite being loaded with style and technical skill, is one of the most difficult thrillers I have had the regret of sitting down. The plot is absurd and tired. It contains some surprisingly effective jump surprises and ugly sequences of graphic murders that should satisfy any horror fan, as long as they manage to overcome the stupid plot, which must have been dated back to 1980.
