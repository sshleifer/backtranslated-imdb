The plot was boring, the girls were disgusting and the alleged Italian male protagonist had never clearly heard an Italian accent. Someone said that the boys were nice in this movie but it seemed to be full of mediocre people. There were literally no positive characters for this film. I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins that seem to fascinate people without any visible reason. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the spotlight to keep them away from the entertainment world. They have no place in it.
