Michael Callan plays a skinny photographer who seems, nevertheless, to be considered a perfect "hold" by any woman who crosses it; Could this have something to do with the fact that it also co-produced the film? He is a "hero" with whom it is very difficult to empathize, so the film is in trouble from the beginning. However, the problems do not end there. It has the production values ​​of a TV movie (check that head made of clay or something like that, near the end) and the final cheaters in a way I can't reveal, in case someone wants to see the film (highly unlikely). Let's just say that the killer knows more than we were made to know that he knows. (* 1/2)
