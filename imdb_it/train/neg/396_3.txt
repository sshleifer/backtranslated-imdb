I saw this when it was in the theater, it started so strong, back in 1980, this was a bold movie and the special effects were excellent at the time. Now you would have had at least about 30 years in 1980 to really understand this point because the study of cinema historically lacks the mentality set at the time of expectations and other related psychological factors. Now, as I said, the film was engaging, full of suspense and very funny. It is built in an excellent climax .... Finally, I mean the person who described it as if he had a balloon in his hand before throwing it, besides being a very poetic description. In my experience, it wasn't strong enough. My wife and I were fine ... how can I say this? We were angry, I mean, we paid money, invested the time to watch the movie which was excellent. "We both felt we had been robbed with an ending that convinced both the production company to have to finish the money and that it failed to raise enough to complete it correctly, in fact my wife said it better, didn't finish, simply stopped!
