I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director, although Robert Altman can be fickle. In this case, it was a great lack. Altman's attempt to create suspense fell on his keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good movie like "Dead Again", I didn't think he could contribute to such a turkey, and I hope he didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen like most Oscar winners of the past. In a downward spiral that includes acting in films of money like this. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films, although his best performance was not "Tender Mercies", but "The Great Santini". This film was really a big waste of time. I give him a 2 out of 10.
