I can start by saying that Casey Affleck is a very talented actor and I respect his work very much. I wish it was in other films that showed his talent. With this saying, Soul Survivors was a very, very bad film. Very ugly. <br /> <br /> I should say that I almost blamed the poor script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an exceptional performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the Hollywood girl. I don't think any of the actors really took part in the script, and I understand why. To say that this film belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. He had the twists you would expect, but they just didn't get anywhere ... except for more confusion. I just found the ending very anti-climatic, because it didn't seem to make any sense or really answer any of the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can't. In all honesty, the only thing I think you'll find appalling about this movie is that you paid for it.
