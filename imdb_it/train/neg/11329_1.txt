Elizabeth Taylor has never been able to act and she was just his usual boring and lacking talent in this movie. This happened before he became so fat, but he still looked very short and squat. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more chances as William Holden would have been better. James Dean has certainly shown that he can mumble through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for too long. The actors were all too young and light and none of them had aged convincingly because of the bad trick. Hudson looked ridiculous for being taken out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
