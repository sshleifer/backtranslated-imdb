OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes into the movie, we exchanged a lot of "ehhh, what is this movie and, more importantly, I am interested in knowing what ends with" looks and decided or we had need drugs to keep us interested in the "plot" or just finish the pain right there and then look at something else. We opted for the latter. <br /> <br /> I really liked "But I'm a Cheerleader", but Mango Kiss is too silly and surreal for my taste, I'm sorry! I definitely prefer "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Scia
