Where to start, this film started badly and ended badly! It consists in an extremely poor acting and in fact unrealistic that made me shiver in my place, seriously, my cat could have behaved better than this lot. <br /> <br /> Some were really ridiculous because it was so incredible, I would have rated this lower, but they have nothing else! So, pay attention to my warning, and unless your neighbor is so bored and you want a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, don't worry about it. I'm still shocked that this could actually be released to the public, this should be a crime and everyone involved should be arrested. I understand that you have the juice now, so I'll let you decide.
