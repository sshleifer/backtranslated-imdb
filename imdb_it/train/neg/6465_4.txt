This output from Charles is decent, but this is a pretty low performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There is a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that forgets to develop and hurts the film a little. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie wants to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" was pretty ugly.
