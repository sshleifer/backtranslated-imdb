I sat in this movie tonight, forcing me to follow him even though I never worried about any of the characters or what happened to them, because the two protagonists, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were great actors of their era cinema and I wanted to see them in "something different", which certainly was this. Both gave excellent performances, but of unpleasant characters. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole film is about a squalid Mexican town inhabited by almost unpleasant characters (the doctor is, of course, the main exception). What Michèle Morgan never sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think of was that, if Sartre's work is something like this film, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate the masterly novel of Camus The Plague, which faced a pestilence in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A well acted but uninteresting film.
