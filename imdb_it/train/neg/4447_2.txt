Yes, there are worse films out there. Many of these are made for fun, on a budget of a shoe string or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this was the 'movie of the week', it wasn't worth more than two stars. It is a poor film on a serious subject that concerns an abused woman who escapes from the king of the humid people in the protective arms of the king of the poor. (If this is an attempt to prove that he does not need a man to protect her, the wuss man is superfluous to the film and should not be there at all). It has no suspense, no character development and a heroine that could be overcome by a rotton onion. (I think she dumps the wedding ring on a boat with a stand-alone tank rather than throwing it overboard into the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after her husband found it, proving that she's an idiot , she still makes childish assumptions that almost lead to her being killed.) I am always amazed when I see the kind of generally high evaluation that gets a film like this and makes me understand that Dr. Seuss still has a huge unused market of people who would be challenged with his work. After I finish laughing at humanity, I will cry.
