The fourth feature film "Tremors" dates back to the time, until the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town of "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". At the beginning of the story, seventeen miners are killed by the ghostly "Graboids". Some of today's "Tremors" characters have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. The most obvious is the ever-renowned Michael Gross (as Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross is inept with firearms; so, he hires gunman Billy Drago (as "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot him some "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This takes a while to get used to - as in the distant past. It's like a western with miniature versions of the original "Graboids" monster. These "Dirt Dragons" tamers are not even remotely terrorists of their "Tremors" counterparts (1990). Consequently, in this film, the characters spend a great deal of time on the ground, something that would not have happened in the original film. And it was strange to have citizens quit the battle so quickly, when Gross temporarily decides to leave the city. Why so powerless? Why didn't Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) immediately gather people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S.
