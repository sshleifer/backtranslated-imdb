I had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my place was the opportunity to complete the post-screening survey. I heard that the biggest problem with the film was the lack of a main storyline. Instead, it consisted of (too much) many sub-plots competing for screen time. Consequently, there is no single sufficiently developed character to allow the public to create any kind of attachment. What the director and producer didn't do was show us why we should worry about what happens to the characters. In fact, any subplot and the characters associated with it could have been completely eliminated without serious damage to the film. (The time gained would have allowed the much needed development of the remaining sub-frames and characters.) Simply put, the plate of The Hungry Bachelors Club is overcrowded with side dishes and snacks when you want an entre.
