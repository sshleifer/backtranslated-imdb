Shown in Australia as "Hydrosphere", this incredibly ugly film is SO so bad that it becomes hypnotized and having to see it until the end, just to see if it could get worse ... and it does! The plot is so predictable that it seems written by a high school, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than miniatures, and the acting is of wood. <br /> <br /> The newborn "muppet" seems to have been stolen from the belief of "Total Recall". There didn't seem to be a single original idea in the whole film. <br /> <br /> I found this film so ugly that it almost made me laugh. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell should lower his head in shame. Obviously he needed money!
