I don't really like the direction of Sean Penn, and this first job, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film does not have a nucleus, it is colored with a kind of catchphrase, an inter-authoritarian tweeness that honestly distorts most of Penn's work, his last work even more than the previous one. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seems to produce a fundamentally trivial product, apparently in some alliance with honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro, and moralistic wrestling competitions , almost as if the Hallmark cards had developed a line of greetings from Hell's Angels, and would have made me want the days of Deliverance, which is a good film. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous promise from Eastern Promises he made with Cronenberg, and that's it. The film is meaningless and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, rather than a story. Congratulations to Charles Bronson, however, who proves he can act. And I wanted more than the character of Sandy Dennis. A terrible 3 out of 10 for this shit of The Indian Runner.
