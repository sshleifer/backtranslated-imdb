This film was one of the greatest films ever made, it had everything to make a film fantastic. Amazing acting, fantastic special effects ...... oh wait I have to think of a good movie. Well, this wasn't one of them, it's just sucked. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is, what kind of bonehead would think this film was a 10. When I voted for my vote there were 206 out there, god knows what's going on in their head . Now as with any other vote, an 8 or 9 was too high, but a 10 ??? Come on, what made this movie so nice to give it a 10? I know these are the same 206 who thought Jean Claude Van Damme was a great dramatic actor.
