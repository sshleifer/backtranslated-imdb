We should have been suspicious of discovering that with only two minutes to the lights out we were the only ones there. Only five others joined before the film began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this film. The acting is horrible (especially Ms Hurley). The script is trivial. The effects we have seen a million times. The film's director is the worst we've seen. Meandering and disjointed. No one laughed, including the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone to make a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to look at your cinema, then buy drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and have people watch. You will have a much more fun time !!! <br /> <br />
