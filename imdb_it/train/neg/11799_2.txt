This may have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British representation was horrible to look at. Have the producers ever set foot in Britain before filming? At least set foot in England ?? I don't think any English person has had such an accent apart from a play by The Royal Family! Even with the 2 English boys ... well, I don't think any English guy has played, spoken or dressed like an English kid in the history of the British nation since the preteen public appearances of Prince William and Harry. For American filmmakers. There is more than one country in the United Kingdom. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. which means more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but it was so bad I couldn't see it. The fire seemed cool!
