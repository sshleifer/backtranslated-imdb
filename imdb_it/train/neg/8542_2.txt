I'm working on the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack collection and on the MOUNTAIN OF WITCHES (El Monte de las brujas) is something like the 17th film in the set. <br /> <br /> The film had nothing to attract my attention. The plot was inconsistent. The dialogue seemed improvised. The acting was poor. The characters were indifferent. <br /> <br /> The best scene is the beginning, with an exasperated woman who is pushed to burn her apparently bratty daughter. However, the only connection that this scene has with the rest of the film is the main character, Mario, who has the most amazing mustache ever. But that's all. <br /> <br /> The film was not effective at any level. The music was too intrusive. The lighting was very dark, so some scenes are almost completely black. It's barely watchable - what else can I say?
