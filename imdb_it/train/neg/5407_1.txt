If you want to see a real "quality" movie, take over The Eden Formula. This wonderful film must have cost everyone $ 50 to make. It features a subtle script, pathetically bad ensembles, lighting and cameras, and a movement in stop, a papier-mâché monster that is completely ridiculous (it seems that sometimes they use a guy in a rubber suit and / or a puppet for monster gloves - but all were equally terrible). <br /> <br /> The actors all speak as if they had never seen them before and were reading a teleprompter. The special effects go far beyond disgust. And the only sad thing is that they dropped the original title really 'Tyranasaurus Wrecks' which sums up exactly what you get for the whole 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> This is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard that you break into the raw underneath. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute of it.
