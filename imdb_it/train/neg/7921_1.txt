The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what remains different is made up of strange aliens. <br /> <br /> I think this movie would be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if someone had actually seen it. The plot is disconnected and, in many (too many) instances, it makes absolutely no sense. The real prodigy here is the reason why in the world it was this sequel created for a film so unsuccessful and horrendous (but still a little better). I highly recommend this movie if you like watching awful movies for a good movie laugh.
