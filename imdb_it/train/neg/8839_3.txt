Nice try and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, human beings who help each other, ...) but a poor result ... The director obviously tried to emulate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an environment that should represent Viet Nam ... The only problem is that this Viet Nam has long since disappeared and when "The scent of green papaya" had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of atmosphere (muffled sounds and the slow rhythm of life. ..) in modern days leaves a feeling of fakes. It also quickly creates a feeling of boredom and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because that is where Harvey Keitel, a former marine in the film, was probably stationed during the war ... But in South Vietnam, nobody or very few people talk to the clip Northern accent shown by the actors ... Really strange even for a bad Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> old poet with leprosy ... very doubtful (not a disease for the people of his condition), a peasant woman who knows how to read and write elaborate Vietnamese poems, ... even more doubts ... < br /> <br />
