Possible spoilers, perhaps. I must say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst films ever made. First of all, the film was made during the pinnacle of Disney's sequel fury. It was created in the same period as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Book of the Jungle II" and "Peter Pan II", which were all disservices to their classics of original cinema. (Disney has also released "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I intend to abandon that topic because their original films were never really classics in the first place. ") Let me go on and say that I am an avid proponent of good Disney movies, and I absolutely adore the original Disney "Cinderella." The sequel to "Cinderella", however, was a waste of time. The Cinderella character in the sequel was so very different from the girl original that in the original, Cinderella was kind and loving: the new Cinderella had moments very out of the character with topical phrasing such as: "I will make this feast in my own way!" that the new Cinderella (as I affectionately call it) says "Ewww!" This is the anti-Cinderella, I try to find the best in people, but later, Anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! The devil? Why? They did everything to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella. or horrible family members for poor little Anasta SIA. My question to the world: did the people of Disney see the original "Cinderella" when it made this sequel? Well, it certainly doesn't seem that way. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was as abusive as Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I am all for redemption and forgiveness, but in this film there was no reason for redemption for Anastasia. In the first, Anastasia was evil. In the second, she is good. One cannot leave a story like this. I hope Disney realizes that this film, among other films, is confusing the name of Walt Disney. Perhaps now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will begin to take shape around the House of Mouse.
