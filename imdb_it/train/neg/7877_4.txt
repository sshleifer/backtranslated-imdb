The creators of this film have created a future where not only abortion and birth control are illegal in every state, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison sentences. In other words, this film is the worst nightmare of all liberals! the political agenda is so heavy here and the style of the film is so low that it almost runs out quite quickly. Regardless of which side of the fence you are in, I recommend you skip it.
