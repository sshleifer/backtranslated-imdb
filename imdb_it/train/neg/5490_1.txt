When I was a child we were used to being a babysitter, and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies we've seen. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, I think it could even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A Martian is dropped onto the earth, turns into a human, makes friends with a human and is trying everything possible to return home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd as the Martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber's Jeff Daniels as Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah in the shoes of Lizzie. But apart from that, it's complete crap. Poor!
