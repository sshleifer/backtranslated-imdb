The film resumes after years the remake with the military who install electronic surveillance equipment in the desert where the attacks occurred in the first film. The crew is killed just before a group of soldiers in a training exercise shows up to find no one around. You can fill in the rest. <br /> <br /> This is a salary picture all around. There seems to be no passion in anyone's performances, nor in anyone behind the camera. This is a movie made for money and nothing else. At some level this should have worked, it could have been a more horrible Southern Comfort (where national guards collide with some people in the swamps), but instead it's not much of anything. In large part you can blame the script, written in an incredible way partly by Wes Craven, which always hits the same old goals. Add to the mess the fact that the direction is boring and the setting of the sequences is so poor gloss to remove any inherent tension in any scene. <br /> <br /> It is not bad as such, but badly done and boring. Allow me to put my feelings into context: The reason I saw this film is because a local multiplex has messed up and directed this film, instead of children, it filmed the last Mimzy and I wanted to see what caused the crying (I want say that films have a lot in common - he says sarcastically). I am convinced that this film will scare only those who like the last Mimzy.
