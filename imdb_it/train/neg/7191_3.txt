I saw him last night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This film is clearly overrated by IMDb fans. The acting was only but regular. The direction did not bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably: the film focuses on those university graduates and the game that make joking calls (7eventy 5ive). And what's more, you can predict the end of the film in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an ax that makes you jump just once or twice during the entire movie, you might like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth it.
