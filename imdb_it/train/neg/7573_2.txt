This film is a vehicle for Schwarzenegger-clone Alexander Nevsky. His charisma, however, is not enough to lift this film above the level of his poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie act. <br /> <br /> Michael York is rather pathetic as the diplomat begging. Watching him revisit his D'Artagnan-act from the moment he was a better actor made me feel uncomfortable. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> History is full of holes and inexplicable relationships; on top of this bill is Vlad's informant, who looks like an American woman, but from the context it seems to work for a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place long after the end of the communist regime, all Russian characters are still very communist. In contradiction to this, Vlad is allowed to drive a mess on all utility vehicles as a police car. The action scenes are hardly affected and therefore lacking in dynamics. <br /> <br /> The movie is absolutely not to be seen ...
