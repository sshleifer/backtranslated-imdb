The original show was much better. They should have left a positive note. This film killed the whole idea. It was boring, too dramatic, and the fun parts were too far away to retrieve the game. This movie seemed really too challenging to be serious, and it wasn't what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention the fact that for a long time it has been depressing about the same thing again and again. So, I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just a little boring, and it's not even funny. Sorry. 4/10 stars is. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
