With a tendency to repeat itself, Wenders has been a constant disappointment since he achieved success with "Paris Texas". <br /> <br /> "Land of plenty" is no exception. Taking note of the fact that I anticipated a mediocre film before I even entered it, Wenders' ambitions always seem to prevail over him. It is taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic. <br /> <br /> I wasn't sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller. The result of Diehl's character is completely predictable. Even Wender's insistence on the layering of many scenes with some rock songs is extremely annoying. He was covering the holes in the script and in the direction, reviving the scenes. <br /> <br /> I am sure that many people will find this film important and resonant, but in all honesty, this clumsy and educational effort speaks only of bad direction. <br /> <br /> Interesting that Wenders stated that while doing the "Paris Texas", he had a great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was Wenders' best and now he should understand that he needs a good script writer. His films of the last 15 years + have been a total disaster.
