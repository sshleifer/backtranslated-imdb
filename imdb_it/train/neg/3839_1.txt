Some movies are so bad that they are good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was as true to history as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the management was poor and traveling too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to end it and go home. <br /> <br /> Neither Melissa Joan Hart ever struck me as a talented actress, but every movie she made was pretty low - budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets her characters fall too close, talking too fast, as if speeding up her words made her more dramatic. It really makes it clear that there is a troupe in front of her and is talking to a camera, when she should involve the viewer in her character. It practically lowers the whole film, and any leg that may have left standing is ruined. <br /> <br /> Probably the only good thing about the film is when it was finally nailed. But even this was not satisfactory enough to suppress my hatred for such a bad movie. See if your taste for cinema is more bland than a piece of toast.
