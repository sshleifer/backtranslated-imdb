My complaints are about the rhythm of the film and the material at hand. While the use of archive films and letters gives the film a fresh and interesting perspective, all too often the material selected to highlight is simply not very interesting (like when Goebbels complains about this or that disorder, etc., small German hometown ). Furthermore, the film runs long in covering c. 1920-1939 and then goes through the war years. In summary, the film is a bit better than a documentary on the History Channel, with the exception that the director has a slightly higher sensitivity than your History Channel documentary editor and therefore can more cleverly organize the details of life of Goebbels. Still, I found that I wanted.
