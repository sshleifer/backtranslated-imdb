To begin with, I would like to say that I am a fan of the American Pie series. Although "the naked mile" and this is the two worst, this seems to be the bane of the entire series. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie movie, which is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> However, there are tons of negative things to say about this movie. First of all, the plot has a very stale "arched" structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the commitment of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympics. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes in length. Apart from the general foolishness of the plot, there is little or no development of the character, which makes a double loss of a negative plot. Apart from that, I didn't really like the stereotyping in this movie. That is, showing athletes as extremely cool guys, just thinking about sex, and explicitly showing geeks as inferior. Furthermore, it shows females only as sexual objects, and men who only want to treat females as sexual objects. Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So, in the end, a generally horrible film, if viewed from a critical point of view. If seen from an adolescent point of view, I think it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't be seen by minors.
