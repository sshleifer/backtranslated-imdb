This film is probably the cheapest, cruelest and poorest sequel ever made. <br /> <br /> Still, it's the funniest and most idiotic film by Disney, and it will guarantee laughter at the sloppy stories and the limping plots from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It's a group of stories that they look like bad fanfics. <br /> <br /> * NOTICE SPOILER * The first concerns all the fact that Beast and Belle are petty for a pathetic argument. Then, three new losing characters decide to fix things by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Partly in this little episode, Belle has her eyes on the wall, which made my brothers and I laugh so hard. So she and the Beast argue more about the letter ... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> So the next one is all about the fact that Lumi√®re is the biggest drug in the world when it comes to romance. This comes from the man who could court any female. And they make FiFi a psychotic malice that tries to kill Belle, and ends up ending up without tape at the end. What a message to send children! <br /> <br /> So the next is all about Mrs Potts who is distressed. And the next one is all about Beast who becomes overly possessive of a bird, to the point that it just looks stupid. <br /> <br /> The animation is so bad, it kills. There are at least 100 errors that you can clearly see ... and the coloring is horrible. Belle is a hissing lymph that gets stuck whenever something goes wrong. Moreover, it is small and very different from the usual Belle. <br /> <br /> And the side characters are boring ... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time. I know they did it in the movie, but it was exaggerated in this.) <br / > <br /> But the worst character is Mrs Potts. She's ruined in this. I can't even describe it. Just buy it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give him a 1/10 for the sap, but I give him a 10/10 for the play.
