Okay, probably the film festival crowd loved it. But your average popcorn that makes fun of movies and scraped together the ten or fifteen dollars it costs to watch a movie these days, will probably wonder why it made this choice. If "Copolla" is printed, it's automatically fantastic stuff, right? Mistaken! It is a clean parody of the director's claims. But it's terribly "inside". I worry when directors are more concerned with entertaining themselves than with the public. It is interesting as a cinematic curiosity and has a chuckle or two in it. But once his course is finished in movies and on TV, the dust will get thicker and thicker on film cans and tape cassettes that hold it. Hardly epochal or epic!
