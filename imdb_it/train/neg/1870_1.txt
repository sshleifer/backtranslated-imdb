I have always loved the bill because of his great script and his characters, but lately it seems to me that he has turned into a kind of emotional soap. If you look at the promotional photos / posters of the account you will now see two of the two officers hugging / kissing or something to do with friendships, while the promotional images of the account long ago would have shown something to do with crime. This shows that much has changed from being an absolutely incredible police drama to an average type of TV soap. When I look at it I seem to see a version of Coronation Street from the police or something similar. I must say that I still like the bill because I am interested in police work and that kind of thing, but I really miss the greatness that Bill had always had. I want to classify it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it was totally ruined by the people who took the bill. <br /> <br /> With regards to the script and the characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters have left now (although some still remain I think) and I'm not saying that the new characters are poor or anything because they certainly aren't, it's just that the hard looks, the personalities and the lines of script that all the old characters had were missing because most of the new ones right now are involved with stupid relationships and family problems . <br /> <br /> Overall it is one of the few police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be a very interesting thing to watch, but as I said it has lost much of its uniqueness (if it's the right spelling) and now it would be classified as a terrible, unreal television soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended to watch for a good laugh about the stupidity of the police officers involved - 2/10
