This movie is NOT so funny - such a waste of big stars, which seem to be taken that way in their own celebrity they forget. Only the bright moments belong to John Cleese as hotel manager who likes to dress: you almost fall from the chair with helpless laughs when he dances with Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" wearing high heels, a mink coat and a delicate hat. The rest: FORGET!
