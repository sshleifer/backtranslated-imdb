So 'Thinner' ... Yes ... This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) films about a man who gets his sweets from a Gypsy Elder he just killed, The story itself is there, no doubt, but I know why I didn't like it more than I could. I guess what the actors really distracted me about. I mean, who's the protagonist? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And if you cry out loud, can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian mafia role there is? And while we're at it, should every mafioso have a pasta that cooks an Italian mother? The only good acting job here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine like the elderly Gypsy. He's pretty good. But the rest, I'll make you all, "best actors ..."
