"True" tale of three girls going to the wilds of Connecticut and ending up chased by a maniac in the woods. This is the kind of film that would have played in the United States thirty years ago with mixed acclamations. Not particularly of all that the film works with its budget reduced to mixed results. The movie is watchable but it's not scary at all (blaming some of the attack scenes for that). It's the kind of movie you'll probably forget once you're done. Chances are you will never think of seeing it unless it was delivered to you by someone and you said "look at this here," which is what happened to me. If a copy is returned to you, the film is not worth seeing even if it is watchable.
