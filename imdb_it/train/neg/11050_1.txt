Terrible use of stage cuts. All continuity is lost, both from a terrible script and from a lethargic direction. That evil robot ... was he a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues usually suffocated by music). And ... where would they get their props? That ship looks like a milk carton ... I've done better special effects on 8mm at 13! <br /> <br /> I advise all film students to watch this film (5 minutes at a time) how to learn how NOT to produce a film. Or ... was it the managers' fault? <br /> <br /> It's really a pity, because the scenery was actually a good concept ... just badly executed all around. (Sorry Malcom, you should have sent a "stand-in". You're an actor too good for such a stinking bomb.)
