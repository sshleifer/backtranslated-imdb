Interesting to read the comments of the spectators regarding the Omega Code ... many of the extremely positive comments were raised almost word for word from the TBN broadcasts ... the film seems made to go directly to the video, to be stored in addition to the three -part of rapture that was made by some other religious group in the 70s .. doesn't it remember? You will not remember this in a year or two. This is the first film I've ever seen where it was implicit that it was your religious duty to go there and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls ... very shameful ... this shows that if you are the son of a televangelist, you too can play the role from Hollywood producer of high-roller with the money of the lil lil ladies ...
