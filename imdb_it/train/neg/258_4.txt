This is the first time I see a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it will be the last. I couldn't figure out why it was funny, even though people in the audience thought it was a lot of fun when he grimaced at the camera, or to say "I'll take a shower". <br /> <br /> the plot is completely predictable. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses it. In the middle, officials are making a mess. The final scenes are absolutely incredible. Spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a boy, but don't you do your homework to solve a meaningless puzzle? <br /> <br /> There is no great acting, there is not much plot or plot and the shot is done in MTV style. Don't waste your money on this. <br /> <br />
