There are two points that I must clarify at the beginning. First of all we all know that this year the Oscars were REALLY all in this year. It was the way the Academy showed people that they were not racist and never had been. They wanted to erase all the preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it is almost useless to comment on the show, because really, what difference will it make? But it's fun to write about it. This is the year I got fed up with the Oscars! I will never watch the show again. They do something wrong every year. Before Crowe wins for "Gladaitor" when the real winner should have been Ralph Fiennes for "Sunshine". If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree. "Eyes Wide Shut" once released did not receive any nominations. And as for this year, well, the wrong choices were everywhere! Baz Lurhmann did not receive the nomination for "Best Director"! Are you kidding!! "A Beautiful Mind" stands for "Best Make-up" ???? "Training Day" is appointed ?? The film was horrible, and it seemed that Washington had not even performed in a performance, all he felt was, he knows how to use the four-letter words! This is what won the award! Take away your tongue and I bet he was almost playing alone! I liked "Gosford Park", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how on earth Altman couldn't give it to him! I mean, come on, if only giving the prize to people to clear up any bad feelings, regarding Altman? Man has been in the public eye for 32 years and no Oscars! There have been many, many things that annoyed me for this year's Oscar, but, I'll live there, until I never need to watch another show again! The highlight (and the ONLY one) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance at the award. This will go down as one of the greatest moments in his show's history.
