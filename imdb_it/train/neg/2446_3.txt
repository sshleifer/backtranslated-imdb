Rajkumar Santoshi undoubtedly directed the biggest films and the biggest box-office hits of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This film falls short of all expectations as this film features two great actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar and When Hai these two actors in the same movie You must make an Opus Magnum. <br /> <br /> In the next part of the film you can see that the voice of Amitabh Bachchan was nicknamed by another person who was due to her illness. <br /> <br /> Again the film had no proper character development, the photography was not good and one thing Bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a large budget. The script had so many flaws that they give The Viewer an apology to participate in his phone calls rather than watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The new Comer shakes his leg but could not act Well, but where the film loses a lot of time is the script for Storyline And Cine matografia. <br /> <br /> A talent like Bhoomika Chawla was wasted in the film as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every filmmaker makes a bad film once in his career. <br /> <br /> So just look at it if you're a fan of multi-store flop movies.
