I have the feeling that the producers of this mess were ready to make the most painful and ridiculous western ever made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can imagine to describe it. <br /> <br /> The positive side is the beautiful color photograph and the beautiful and spoken Rhonda Fleming. My solidarity goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted quite well in an annoying role, written so atrociously that no actor could give a pleasant performance. The production values ​​were quite good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and script. <br /> <br /> Things I Hated: Stewart Granger looked so little like a western figure, with his British accent, the clean, tailored suit, and silly and immaculate white handkerchief tied around his neck. The way the citizens and his son were constantly harangue and insulting Granger was tiring, and he never spoke or answered. I know we should suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerners as symbolic dramas of morality, but this has broken the spell with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst thing at the end where Granger miraculously, quickly and alone plants dynamite around a canyon passes that the cattle of the wicked will pass, and then Granger lands in the perfect spot so that he can hit the dynamite from a very distant distance to create rock slides to bury and frighten the cattle and villains, apparently destroying them all, save the two main villains. The next worst is all about the plot, which is full of soap opera scenes. Nothing in the film seemed credible: I could not believe what the whole conflict was. The villain was driving his herd to the market and wanted the cows to chew grass along the way; I don't see why something could not be solved. Do you need a dispute over land ownership for this? Don't worry about seeing it.
