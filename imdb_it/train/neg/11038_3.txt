I have always written this series as a complete fetid party because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then a tragic coincidence happened one day. After a White Sox game ended, I realized that the remote control was on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could get up and walk across the room to get the remote or even the TV to turn on the channel. So why not get up and walk around the country to watch TV in another state? "Nuts to that," I said. So I decided to stay close to the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode of which I remember very little, except that I had once again made a very broad and general general judgment based on zero objective or experiential tests, with nothing to support my opinions with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total cruelty! Belushi has all the comedic deliveries of a hairy lighthouse siren. Women are physically attractive, but even Stepford - is to arouse any real feeling from the viewer. There's absolutely no reason to keep you from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt back to the devil. <br /> <br /> Except .. <br /> <br /> Except for the wonderful comic lyrics by Larry Joe Campbell, the greatest American comic actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he's golden. How good is he really? Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. It's like trying to make warts appear. But Campbell pulls him in style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoon, so that he can win every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant Courtney Thorne-Smith, who slaps Belushi on the head with a pan while alternately beating his chest and playing with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because it enhances the taste of all that is in!
