Tierney is a real tough guy, but this bonfire of the normally competent RKO movie reduces its impact at every turn. The script is as plausible as OJ Simpson's at a dinner of ten pilgrims. It only counts the times that Tierney's incredible car mates swallow one excuse after another for his evasive and violent actions. The old clich√© about it "only happens in movies" applies here to spades. Then there is the guy who plays the guardian, who seems to have wandered from a WC Field play, ruining the threatening mood in the process. Even the static sets of a room are not helpful, nor is the obvious lack of sensitivity of the director to the material. So add a last car chase, losing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are rather flat. In fact, the film shoots only in the scenes of the station houses where biting cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas guardians. Too bad that Tieney's career has never really been up to par. I guess this is largely due to being such a big guy off the screen, as always, and getting into one mess after another. His cool ways and the clarity of emotions remind me of Lee Marvin's times for his tough boyfriend. However, this project may have worked like a radio show, but like a film with a promising noir title, it's a disappointment.
