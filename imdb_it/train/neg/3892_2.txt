Want to see a scary horror movie? So avoid this. There isn't enough beer in the world to make this movie enjoyable. <br /> <br /> However, there is enough scotch. Single malt, if you can handle it. <br /> <br /> If the previous comments are not enough to stop you from watching this sober film, let me help you. NASA sends only one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar glow makes Colonel Steve West bleed from his nose. Things go downhill from there, and the strangeness follows. Actually I read the adaptation of the book, which was published and published only in the United Kingdom. MIGLIA better than the film, and the book was terrible. At least some claims are made towards suspense, and a sort of explanation of events is extracted from the author (rhymes with "gas"). Not to mention that the film is completely devoid of merit. Rick Baker has learned that he should really read a contract before signing a movie, and Jonathan Demme has discovered that he is much better suited to direct. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is an MST3K episode with this film, but it is obviously quite modified. Without the obligatory flash of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you. <br /> <br /> Please, go and watch the Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy break up. Watch Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I cannot, in all conscience, recommend this film to the sober public of cinema.
