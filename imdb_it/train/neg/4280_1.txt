This must be accompanied by a special assessment and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's obsession with the dirtiest bodily functions becomes a real nightmare here. Furthermore, it is evident that man is a misanthrope, he hates everyone - his country, his people, his actors, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and forgets the profession he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "film" is just a horrible series of disgusting images, without artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult to good taste and common sense. Shame, shame, shame!
