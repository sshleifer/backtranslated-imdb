I can say in a catogoric and unmistakable way that in all my 51 years on this planet it is the worst film (probably for children) I have ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> I took my three older sons to see it and they too were struggling to raise a smile during all the tortuous 90 minutes. The sexual clues I will leave for another day but they were as bland as the movie. They should pay you to watch it and not pay them. It's really really terrible, there's no other way to describe it. The people who made this film should be forced to take money under false pretenses. <br /> <br /> Aplogise for my spelling mistakes, but I'm so angry that it ruined the time I had with my nephews Greetings, Stephen
