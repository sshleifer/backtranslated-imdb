What a weekend. Two days ago I saw the first part of "War Games 2: Dead Code", now "While she was out". I'm trying to come to a decision that was worse in terms of pain in my mind as I watched. I guess, "while she was out" it was worse. <br /> <br /> It has already been said in other comments: Unrealistic, illogical, etc. - the only thing I have to add is that at a certain point I started to feel more at ease for the wicked than for the woman because I would have recommended her for a Darwin prize if she had actually died (I only looked at the first half, so I don't know). Soon I was at two Darwin awards (though it is possible) for his immense stupidity. <br /> <br /> And, hey: Produced by Kim Basinger? So he not only knew the script but was also responsible for bringing this waste of money to us, to the people? I consider human beings who waste huge sums of money to be evil because the money could have been used to feed and dress a lot of people instead of hurting 80% of those who saw it in the cinema and give 20 %, which are idiots, a good opportunity to show how much of an idiot they are.
