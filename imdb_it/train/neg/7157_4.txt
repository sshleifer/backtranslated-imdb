1st seen 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange story about a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting her niece's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of disturbing quality takes place in this film, not unlike The Shining by Stephen King. The difference is that in Nicholson's performance there was a certain camp that is not present in this film at all. This is taken very seriously until the end, when some limps and attempts to illuminate the atmosphere do not work at all. Performance isn't the problem here, but the story is. It does not seem that everything is confused perfectly and the viewer remains a lot of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small performance by Christopher Walken in the role of the niece's uncle, who, of course, gives him maximum billing in an attempt to sell the film. Don't buy this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
