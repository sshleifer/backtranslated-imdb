It is rather ugly when the synopsis of the generic film has more information than the film itself. The "plot summary" of the paragraph written on the film page contains details that I could not infer from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing up to see what details I had just lost and could tell me what was happening. Alas, to no avail - this film leaves out monstrous pieces of history, if I could call it a story. It is as if they were trying to deceive us into thinking that there was some kind of film here, filming just enough so that there was the similarity of a story and leaving the rest to our imagination. Newsflash to the creators: I paid to see you make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine the plots and textures for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name on my face, and I can see why. He had one of the most artful performances I've ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I thought it was ok, maybe he didn't really want the role, he just had a big offer for a movie he wasn't in? Mistaken. It was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, don't book yourself as a guide if you don't know how to act. If you can, then create a decent character for yourself. Also, someone here mentioned the white / Latin problem - yes, I hate to say it, but this film looks like an act of revenge against college-aged white males wearing baseball hats. This is what happens when there is nothing in the film that makes the observer of the Latin characters loved. The character of Adrian looks like an exaggerated idiot who is no better than the antagonist of history. As for the Maya character, he didn't look like a real person. Anyway, I'm ashamed for Hollywood that this film was made.
