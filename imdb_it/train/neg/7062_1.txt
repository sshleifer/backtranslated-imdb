OK, honestly, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> this made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no acting, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I thought when I first saw May 28, 2003 ** attention, this is a spoiler alarm. it's also a lot of me complaining about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> ok so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there's no explanation of the characters. as far as I knew, the main character was new in this school, but apparently not. he also seemed to live alone ... then that he was a foster boy ... then that his mother was a furious alcoholic who still lived with him. all his friends also apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> now we come to a main point of the plot, this crazy guy has escaped from the asylum and is spreading. now our main character is obsessed with this guy and he focused intensely on him for the contingency of the movie. I think I lost a main element of the plot here, there was no reason for the main character to be hooked. even if that's the point, having no reason, because all his friends, who are as skeptical as 5 minutes before, suddenly follow him and do what they want. <br /> <br /> then the film continues and gets everything ok. are doing havoc on the school, blah blah blah. but wait a minute ... suddenly everyone knows that the main character is performing the 'show' here. Wait a second, didn't the madman specifically tell the main character NOT to do it? it had to be nothing. <br /> <br /> ah another important element of the plot was skipped ... the madman didn't have to be crazy ... everyone said he wasn't crazy. but while the story continues, it is VERY CLEAR OUTSIDE ITS MIND. but I thought the journalists said it wasn't ... hm ... <br /> <br /> now the movie closes. WHAT WAS THE NEIGHBOR? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? not only did the ending not answer any questions about the main character, it didn't answer any questions about the crazy guy. are these people in the same situation? if so, then there are some very simple baselines that don't tend to this. if not then what is the point in saying "it's you in two weeks"? <br /> <br /> * end of the thing ... * <br /> <br /> is what I thought then. this is more or less what I still think now. 6 months have passed, and if I can get it for free, I could give it another chance, but I doubt it. I strongly doubt it
