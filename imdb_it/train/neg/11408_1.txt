This was simply terrible. I read this book for school, I did like in all the tests and to see it like this! My teacher forced me to do it with me and 20 other people, and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 of Outer Space and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this movie so terrible was reason enough to want to kill yourself. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was terrible. Third, it was completely different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I asked to be excused. Basically, I'd rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch it. Follow my advice, don't watch this movie. No one would like to watch this. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
