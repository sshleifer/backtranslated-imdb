This video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995. Beautifully done! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have great chemistry on screen when they talk about what the Start button does. I'm waiting for Microsoft to release a DVD in a special edition complete with deleted scenes, comments by Bill Gates, a documentary on how Windows 95 is comparable to Windows XP and more! <br /> <br /> In general: 10/10 (should have won at least one Golden Globe)
