I * loved * the original Scary Movie. I'm a big fan of parody, it's my favorite form of humor. It is sometimes considered the smartest form of humor. The Wayans guys seemed to capture that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when they made the sequel. I think the Wayans are a family of comic genes. Alas, genes also make mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the promise. I liked the parody of "The Exorcist", in particular the "come out, but" gag. Now this is Wayans quality material. But apart from that, I can only think of two other times I laughed: 1) when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then he becomes sticky and starts talking about marriage with him. Meanwhile, he's saying, "It was just a booty call !!" It was pretty funny. 2) The parody of "Save the Last Dance" in which the character of Cindy inadvertently beats a girl while practicing her new moves. But even the short giggles are not up to the secondary laughter of the first Scary movie. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is pure junk, full of coarse gags. The lines of the first film, subtle or implicit, are exaggerated and magnified. For example, in Scary Movie I, many allusions are made to imply that the character Ray is gay. This was fun. But, in Scary Movie II, the whole penis strangling scene with Ray under the bed was incredibly stupid and incredibly realistic. This is the scheme of the whole film. Screaming humor * alone * doesn't make a movie very far. This was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm sorry to judge a Wayans movie this low, I have to give it 2 out of 10.
