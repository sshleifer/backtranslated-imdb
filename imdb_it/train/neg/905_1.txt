An unmarried woman named Stella (Bette Midler) becomes pregnant by a rich man (Stephen Collins). She offers to marry her for a sense of obligation, but she refuses him and decides to raise the child by herself. Things go well until the child named Jenny (Trini Alvarado) becomes a teenager and things gradually (and predictably) get worse. <br /> <br /> I saw both the silent version and the sound version of "Stella Dallas". Neither of them struck me very much (and I cry easily) but they were well done if dated. Trying to do it again in 1990 was just a stupid idea. I imagine that Midler has had enough power after the incomprehensible success of "Beaches" for doing it. This (predictably) bombed. The story is ridiculous and dated by today's standards. Although Midler and Alvarado are performing well, this movie really drags on and I finally got bored. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good actors) do not help support roles. Flimsy and boring. Really - who thought it would work? See instead the Stanwyck version of 1937. I give this a 1.
