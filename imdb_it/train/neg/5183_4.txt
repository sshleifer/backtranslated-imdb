This is the first of this collection of "8 Films To Die" that I saw and it certainly didn't make me want to see the rest ... even if I heard at least a couple of them they are decent. I don't know, it wasn't terrible but it didn't do much for me. Your dysfunctional cannibal family based in the suburbs genre, mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?) Where they continued to bring home stray food sources whenever possible. The best part of this was the frightening Sister Goth, who obviously invites a friend to school who never leaves. However, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. This family is a bit like the white bread version of Sawyer's Clan, they are bad and do bad things but they are not without a soul. I see a lot of reviews from people who liked this, and I think I don't know what I missed, but I found it very mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10.
