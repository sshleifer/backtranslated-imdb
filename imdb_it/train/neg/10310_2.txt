Lorenzo Lamas plays a sort of CIA agent, who captures an exotic beauty named Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to provide a dash of acting credibility for the not-so-talented ensemble. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his films. Stink. However compared to O.J Simpson and Lamas, Kinmont's comatose wife, Lamas seems ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I saw the CIA only because of the renewed interest in the O.J Simpson trial, because if your parents had extra cable and channels, you couldn't escape this movie. in 1994 you could go to an Amish community and some morons could play in their portable TV. The film itself is a collection of limping action sequences and would be intriguing even if the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping after fireballs and the exchange would be a liner providing some involuntary humor. Also, where were Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant to make this a complete field classic? <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
