I don't envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for making this movie. It is, in a word, boring. Perhaps the fact that it is too predictable, the losing role of Ben Stiller, rather than exploited or funny scenes not really make this film something to forget. Even the appearance of Christopher Walken ends in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love the acting of Ben Stiller. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and it wasn't so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, apart from High Fidelity I've never seen him do something good. What do you think about School of Rock? Ooops, scary.
