Horrible movie. Of a crusty old painter who gets stuck with a girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the motions on his part, and has some of the bravest lines in film history. Richard Burton seems close to death in this film and we should believe that "Good for sixty years" appears. The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are horrible, as is the story. It's really hard to feel for someone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, it's pretty funny. This film is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please don't watch this movie. She's really bad, and you wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It was not, due to BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS, we know that it can behave well, but still, don't rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something when he was handsome, and not a fossil.
