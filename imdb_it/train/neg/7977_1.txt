Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically a smart movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the film is fine. But, even though I was very interested in the subject and I like to think and discuss religion (I am an atheist), it was difficult to force me to watch the film for a bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. Why is this film so incredibly boring? I do not know. He is alone and therefore not recommendable.
