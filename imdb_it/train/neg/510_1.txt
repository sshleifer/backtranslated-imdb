This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made and published by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. Dialogue is written in clich√©s; for this you can complete many sentences in the script. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The "choreography" is foolish and completely unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw Yvonne's 23-year-old dance as sexual; it's just a bad choreography. The ballet scene at the beginning of the film is particularly ridiculous. If you like bad movies and you have fun laughing with some of the Hollywood turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colored version on VHS, making the film even worse. Yvonne's heavy make-up, when colored, makes her look like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this movie. What a way to launch a career.
