Well. Where to start Let's say this; avoid this movie at all costs <br />. It is based on a series of cartoons. The film makes the cartoon <br /> <br /> like Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed here <br /> <br />, bad camera work, terrible music and enough product placement for <br /> <br /> make you want to never visit Yahoo! again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. To quote the New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett make their way through this photo with the gay abandonment of the men who have identified a rare species of salaries in the distance. <br /> <br /> They should pay us some of the millions earned for watching it. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
