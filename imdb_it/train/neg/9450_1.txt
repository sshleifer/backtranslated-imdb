Spend your time in another way, even household chores are better than this movie. The jokes are not funny, the funny rhymes that are Dr. Seus are not there. A very bad way to waste an evening. My boys 4-16 laughed a little at first, the younger ones got bored and let Barbie play and the older ones let ps2 play and surf the net. My wife left and did the dishes. So I finished it myself. It was the worst "children's" movie I saw. If you want to watch a fun children's movie watch Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS FILM. It's not funny, it's not cute, cat make-up is the only good thing and you can see it on the disc label.
