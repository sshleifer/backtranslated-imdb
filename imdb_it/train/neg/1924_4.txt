DR. SEUSS 'HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a holiday film that inspires your seasonal spirits and continues the classic classic Dr. Seuss fable, don't I see "Dr. Seuss" How the Grinch stole Christmas. "If you're old enough to read this review, you're probably too old to get pleasure from this movie. It contains a lot of colors, a creative production design and an imaginative set and costumes, joyful load noises, and the characters are made to look like the inhabitants of the fictional village of Whoville, unfortunately the positive elements of the film end here, the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on the screen while making a devilish grin, all while hurtling through the script wide without much to do. <br /> <br /> Many people recognize the story of how the messenger stole Christmas from Whoville, so I won't waste my time writing a detailed synopsis to read. film is performed in three main acts: the development of the grinch and the setting, the Whoville festival and the vision of Dr. Seuss of the villain who steals the Who from l gold Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. As in "Battlefield Earth", I don't see why producers take expensive actors just to have their identities protected by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, there's SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, Bill Irwin's wife, the last one who plays Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the mayor of Whoville, Anthony Hopkins lends his screaming voice to the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinch's lost lover. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers try to bring originality to history by adding useless subplots and focusing too much on little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman seems to go everywhere through the film landscape; there is little or no focus on the part of director Ron Howard and the script is predictable, too broad and artificial. The only character who gave any distinction here is the same Grinch, all the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is too zealous and too trivial to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity! <br /> <br /> The positive factors of the film go to the talented production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack and the large make-up department. "Like the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very nice production. The sets and atmosphere created by the directors are detailed and imaginative; it is as if the public is visiting a world as in a dream. The people of Whoville are full of makeup, to the point that we cannot tell the actor to recite the lines without humor. Even if dazzling, I can't really give credit for the services, because they ended up because of the expensive technical office that takes their place. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is an actor I can talk about. His performance is what almost destroys the film itself. He is too selfish as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comic to allow the story to be recognizable everywhere as Seuss's work. Surprisingly, although there are some funny moments due to some sly clever sequences, no laughter comes from the stupid stupidity of Jim Carry. It's almost as if the film was written specifically for Carry to exaggerate with his part. This factor only brings the film to a wild but brainless comedy, which is just a pale shadow of the classic Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". <br /> <br /> After this film, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have rolled into the grave. <br /> <br />
