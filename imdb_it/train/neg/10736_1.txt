The film starts off enough with an intriguing scene, three people drink and chat in a bar. All of them invent somewhat scandalous stories. As the film develops, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. However, in addition to this the film is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation occurs just in the middle of the film and, frankly, not much remains to be seen. The rest of the time the director lingers in an abandoned god in the Russian village full of gracious and gruesome old ladies. Of course, these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but admiring them goes on too long, sacrificing every possible plot or character development. I found this film as another example of bad or lazy film production, in which instead of trying to make an interesting story, film producers focus on strangely fascinating images and in some almost unrelated stories (emblematic case - the story of Meat Trader) leave the viewer to understand all the odds and ends. On a surface it has an artistic aspect, but in this particular case it is nothing but lack of talent.
