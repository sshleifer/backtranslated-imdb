If this is based on the relationship of real life, as is claimed, between Mrs. Curtin and Mr. Levinson, I am thrilled not to know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills freely during the film, while the theme is played on the ground. Many stupid scenes with stupid people are not a comedy.
