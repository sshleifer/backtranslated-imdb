This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants to have a super power to be able to have fun orally, I think the film is in the realm of 14-year-old male fantasy. The bedroom scene was exaggerated and reduced an intimate moment to a farce of biological functions similar to the gas circulating in public. From the first scene of each other it was a discussion of how little sex they had to get, how much time has passed since they had it, when their next sexual relationship will be, and with whom it should be. Furthermore, dialogue and acting were very poor, very forced, unheard, and filled their lack of content with unpleasant sex scenes. This could have been really fun because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here. Please don't even think about taking someone under the age of 16 if you have to go and see it.
