Of course, it seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a play by Neil Simon. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll find out. <br /> <br /> In truth, Martin, the protagonist, is misunderstood. He's not doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like "The Jerk", but instead plays a sort of intermediate character that doesn't work. Hawn, with no one to play with, is terrible. Cleese is the only member, even partially funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, the plot is rather stupid. I can't say how much it can be changed, but the characters seem to lack the slightest sense of common sense. They cross New York, they do nothing right, and unfortunately, nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise absolutely incredible, it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In summary, instead of seeing this, again renting the original "strange couple".
