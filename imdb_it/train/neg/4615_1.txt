I may not have the longest attention, but this is the second film that I refused to see until the end, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> At first I thought the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh about, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. Rather, the script was ridiculously amateurish, the film dragged on and felt disconnected, as if someone had cut a feature-length TV series. The Academy must have been drugged when it nominated this film for no less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second film I refused to see until the end. The first was "Sterminatore". I hope this gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1/10
