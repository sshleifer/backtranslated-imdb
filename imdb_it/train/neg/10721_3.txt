An expedition led by Hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) travels to the Valley of the Kings in Cairo to find out what happened to a previous expedition. They meet the beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann) who joins them. Soon they are faced with a blood drinking mummy ... and only Simira seems to know what is happening. <br /> <br /> A true snoozer. I took it on TV late at night when I was about 10 years old. It made me fall asleep! Seeing him again all these years later, I can see why. It is slow, the mummy does not appear even up to 40 minutes (and this is only 66 minutes long!), The acting goes from bad (Dana) to REAL bad (George N. Neise) and there is no violence or blood to find . This film focuses more on secondary dramas (involving a silly love triangle) than horror. <br /> <br /> This three-star rate because it looks really good, everyone plays it straight, there is some good Diane Brewster acting, it's short and the mummy's attack scenes (all three) are not bad. They are not scary just slightly disturbing. However, this film is pretty ugly. A safe fire for insomnia.
