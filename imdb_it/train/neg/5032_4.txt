This film was in a pack of 50 sci-fi that a friend of mine took me for Christmas. It is very similar to Gozilla's first film, and like that movie, it has scenes with American actors inserted without a real reason. An interesting thing about the scenes included is that there is a tension of the Cold War portrayed between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and is unleashed all over the world, paying a lot of attention to Tokyo because no great monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites it. All in all, this is an ok film. Some of the scenes that involve Gamera, in particular the Toly scenes, are quite spectacular and have quite decent special effects at the moment. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you'll really enjoy yourself. I gave it a 4 out of 10. If this was the unpublished Japanese version I looked at, it probably would have gotten a 5.
