I wonder what is the purpose of making films like this? the profit? and to whom do they refer what intelligence must use the brain to look at something like this shit? This film can be watched by children under the age of 3 if you are an adult, do not try to watch it. This is why I think Hollywood has started using cartoons in movies with actors like this, you have to forget about the art of cinema, make sure you get tons of popcorn to consume for a while until this movie ends to receive many cola burgers. laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but certainly not in a theater, my dog ​​who is always close to my family when he watches a movie leaves the building. What is certain is that this film refers to people without requests from the art of cinema. The only thing this film can be used is to watch it while doing the supermarket shopping list. I'm giving 2 stars to support the efforts of Indian cinema, but for nothing more or less ..
