What's happening at ITV Drama. First, "Losing Gem" is simply the worst TV drama I've seen in years, and now "Perfect Relatives" is a complete disaster from beginning to end. Anyone responsible for commissioning this drivel should receive P45 with a special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most Drama / Thrillers, the requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the plot can develop, but "Perfect Parents" has taken this to a new level, I suspended so much conviction for the end of this absurdity, I felt that I was force-fed with a truck loaded with "magic mushrooms", it was as if the writers had decided to try and create a "drama of numbers" involving some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedofillia, the only problem was as the great Eric Morecambe once said while playing a piano, "I'm playing all the right notes, just not necessarily in the correct order". For your next Script kids, I suggest you try reading some other Script writing for Dummies script development books. <br /> <br /> Due to the ridiculous script and the total lack of Tension in the Direction, the acting was adequately low key, not because of the actors as the cast was first rate. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this unpleasant piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the postman tries to deliver a script to the ITV drama department, make sure the letterbox is tightly closed !!
