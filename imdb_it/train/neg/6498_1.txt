I've seen bad movies before, but this brings the "Worst Movie of a Lifetime" award by far !! Anthony Hopkins must be completely mentally ill to have his name attached to this - everywhere! I will never see another film with him, directing it, etc. Etc.! I can't believe the other actors and actresses that I liked (in this photo), who have dropped so much to be part of this disaster! There must be some great drugs out there! For anyone not to be embarrassed to be part of such a film, it's beyond me! Save your money on this! HUGE FLOP from start to finish! Shame on you Mr. Hopkins! Also, shame on Christian Slater! I can't believe you put your reputation on the line for this!
