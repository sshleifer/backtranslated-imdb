Have you ever seen a movie that lost the plot? Well, he didn't even have one to begin with. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The painfully boring scenes of our heroine who sit at home without any sense of threat or even omen even created during seemingly constant storms (which strangely never really feel at home - large double glazing)? The house that apparently is a few miles from a city is still several hours of walking (?) Or the third girl who has no purpose in the plot other than to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable ? Or even the beginning that suggests a wave of over 20 killings throughout the area even though it is clear that the killer never ventures away from home? Or the bizarre ritual with salt and pepper that largely summarizes the lack of intrinsic direction of the film. <br /> <br /> Add a leading actress who can't act but at least is willing to do something completely irrelevant to naked shower scenes and this video is really ugly, but not in the way you hope. <br /> <br /> Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 1980s (mainly due to a surprisingly extensive extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity - and a classic "daft" murder (don't worry - it's wired at least ten minutes before). <br /> <br /> After a walk in the woods our victim reaches an ascending slope which they obviously struggle with. Halfway they see a figure above dressed in black and brandishing a large sickle. What are they doing? Do you slide down and run like all of us? No, of course not- they fight to the top and are comfortably at ease in front of the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> It's really just a movie as they say ..
