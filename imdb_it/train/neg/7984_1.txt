Too many secondary plot lines without a primary. Too many buttons are pushed for no reason, they have managed to fill this boring film, which says nothing, with every dramatic element out there: death, divorce, money problems, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse adoption, rejected love, travel problems, sex, misunderstandings of generations, robberies, legal problems, weapons, medical ethics, "profound true love" ?? You would think it would be an interesting film, but hell not? all these events are secondary to something primary that is not there. Boring. Not to mention the fact that the "super-deep" (and super-long) conference of the child at the end of the film is a total nonsense. Sin. <br /> <br /> Oh, I forgot to mention it: the actors, all of them, are pretty good. This is what stopped me from turning it off. Too bad that their talents have been lost, the film is also well shot: the light, the motion, etc. Of every episode - it's all right. It is only the meaning that is missing.
