I had the misfortune of wasting 10 pounds by buying the new movie SS on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief by watching movies like this. A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the couch watching a noisy end-of-evening awakening is perfect for a single alpha male like me. I bought this movie thinking I would see fantastic martial arts and shoot myself. <br /> <br /> I made hell. Segal is old and swollen, the plot was ridiculous even by SS standards and to end Segal's acting (as in the beginning) is exceptionally terrible. So terrible indeed that half of his voice was dubbed by a man who looked like NOTHING LIKE HIM. Or the SS cannot act anymore (a controversial point) of the crew were so terrible in their work that they could not properly record the sound. The voice will move back and forth between Mr. Whisper Segal and the off-screen voice for the Honda commercial! <br /> <br /> The plot is not the problem because most action movies work on the same premise as this one, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters that will die horribly like cannon fodder and stereotyped villains waiting to be swept away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as you will avoid walking in front of a running train or a dose of H5N1 avian flu. <br /> <br /> Total garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This was a public health warning.
