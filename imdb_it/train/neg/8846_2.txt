In the version of the mini-series of the Tower of Babel, the narrator describes the builders of the tower as "the descendants of Moses". <br /> <br /> It's like saying that George Washington lived many centuries before Alexander the Great. <br /> <br /> Or that the light bulb was invented before the wheel. <br /> <br /> Or that the guided missile was the forerunner of the bow and arrow. <br /> <br /> Do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> The writers of The Greatest Heroes of the Bible should have at least paid more attention to the chronologies of people and biblical events.
