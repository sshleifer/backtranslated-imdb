Good grief! While I continue to argue that Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst piece of mental torture available, the Hobgoblins came terribly close. This ... this ... what insults the public at every turn. <br /> <br /> At least movies like Space Mutiny and Future War can be enjoyed on mst3k, this was a struggle to overcome. I was literally writhing on the couch in anguish. This thing managed to embarrass me - alone! <br /> <br /> Even if you're an avid MST3K fan and you've done your mission to see every single experiment, think twice before seeing it. <br /> <br /> It's so bad.
