Chan Wook Park is nothing if not inventive. I AM A CYBORG, BUT THAT OK is chock full of little and funny technical tricks with some ingenious ideas in between. Trying to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on an imaginative and carefree story that radically differs from its usual sweetness. Hardly one to criticize for his ambition or his vision, it is really unexpected, therefore, to see all the efforts of Park are added to so little. <br /> <br /> I AM A CYBORG, BUT OK it seems unbelievable to subtract from itself as it proceeds, with the final result being a fraction of the sum of its parts. The premise is promising, the gags are abundant and the unusual humor abounds but everything fails miserably to create a meaningful connection with the public. The characters are cute and bizarre and played with taste by the cast, but try as I could, I couldn't bring myself to take care of anyone. <br /> <br /> SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a misstep, indicating perhaps that Park was exaggerating a little, but still managed to show some of the director's unique flashes and, in the wake of an impressive filmography, he was promptly forgiven. No absolute certainty that he has commanded the COMMON SECURITY AREA or SIMPATIA PER IL SIG. VENGEANCE is evident here. I AM A CYBORG, BUT THIS IS RIGHT, it left me so completely free from the unexpected that I got surprised from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 5/10, and with that measure, this probably doesn't deserve more than a 3. For the sake of old times, I'll be generous: 4/10
