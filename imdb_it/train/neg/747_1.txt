In the end I thought that someone would do justice to the H.G. classic Wells, not another version set in the room or in the wrong era, but one based firmly on the book. Well, surely he faithfully follows the book, and that's the only advantage of this mess. <br /> <br /> This is 180 min long (yes 3 hours), the book has only 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had the courage to come here and say "if you can do better ..." I would say "yes, I could" and I've never used a video camera or been to any type or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid a lot of money to bring this crap to the US from the US, don't make the same mistake as me.
