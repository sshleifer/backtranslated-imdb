Poor performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Grossly underdeveloped support characters. Annoying, without plot. The end leaves you flatter than a pancake, with more free parts than you could tie in four sequels (ie, if you are also interested in these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real resource. That penultimate sequence in which the "hood of Chicago" looks for the character of Sinatra is ridiculous. Even the music in that sequence is poor. And in the final scene, when Martin's character removes the hat for the woman who called a "pig", he almost made me go out and find a stone to throw through my TV screen.
