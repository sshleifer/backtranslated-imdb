Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like those old B-movies, should give you a warning about the quality of this film. This is, however, not a B-movie. It's a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and the animals - WOW - are the worst data animation ever made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the SCAAARY sabretooth shown on the cover. You only hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and from time to time you see a tooth or a tiger's foot. He's so amateur! Maybe it's worth seeing, just because it's so ugly. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best film I've ever seen and I'm waiting for their reaction" He, he. <br /> <br /> The film is weak to give you a Spoiler alarm! THIS IS A SPOILER.
