Yes, right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the film to take flight. It was horribly boring, and consisted mainly of people riding randomly around the hills without an apparent direction. So the hero enters the scene. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he turned white. Obviously white. He wasn't even close to being an Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting, and history did nothing to help the cause. Battle sequences without points and lame dialogues. It's an hour and forty-five minutes, and in the end I was trying to eat my face. I watched it because the people in the video store where I work always ask me if this movie is okay. Now I have an answer. It goes something like this: ahem. "NO! GOOD GOD NO! IT'S HORRIBLE! DON'T DO THIS TO YOU! I would recommend another movie, maybe one that's fun."
