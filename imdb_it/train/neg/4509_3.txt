"Memoirs of a Geisha" is a visually stunning melodrama that looks more like a camp, the satire of the drag queen than anything to do with real people. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film defensively continues to insist that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines, who are the embodiment of traditional Japanese beauty. But apart from a breathtaking dance, the rest of the film degenerates into "Pretty Baby" in the territory of Storyville, or at least Vashti and Esther in the history of Purim, since all the efforts of women for art and artifice concern the entertainment of much, much older, drunk and drunk men. Perhaps it is the Japanese culture that is prostituted, and not just for American gypsies after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's the trouble of speaking in English, but Ziyi Zhang barely shows the great flare she showed in "House of Flying Daggers (Shi mian mai fu") and "Hero (Ying xiong). " Michelle Yeoh occasionally shows a glimpse of her performance assured in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)." Only Li Gong shows real life. Otherwise, I continued to imagine Charles Ludlam in various roles, or even Cillian Murphy, as in the kabuki theater, particularly as the plot dragged down in the feline struggle after the feline fight. <br /> <br /> The supposed love story has no chemistry, mostly due to age differences, and I especially felt sorry for Ken Watanabe and hoped his Hollywood salary would compensate for his loss of dignity as a the mysterious "President". I remember more emotion in "Portrait of Jennie" as she is eager to grow into Jennifer Jones to please Joseph Cotton. <br /> <br /> We see brief glimpses of reality when geishas pose with normal women as photo attractions and, as ageless, Ziyi Zhang lives the war years in a very colorful kimono operation. The ending has little sense of normality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack includes many traditional cut-out melodies, with Yo Yo Ma's cello and Yitzhack Pearlman's violin in place of the traditional instrumentation, which are beautiful to listen to along with the beautiful photography, as long as you completely ignore the plot and the rigid acting. <br /> <br /> As my mind wandered, I wondered how the great Japanese directors of samurai films would face this story, which probably would have been more formal, but much more emotional.
