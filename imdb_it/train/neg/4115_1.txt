"Power Play" starts off interesting but goes down fast. The only good actor is Tobin Bell and he has a very small part. Beyond Bell, "Power Play" has no value or interest in redemption. "Power Play" has more earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so invented and absolutely incredible. And all the action scenes look like a group of third grade pupils staging a play. It's terrible, just awful. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if "Power Play" was made in the 60s or 70s, it would be considered a poor "B" class movie. The fact that "Power Play" was released in 2001 is really sad. Is there a class "D" movie? If so, "Power Play" launches the mold.
