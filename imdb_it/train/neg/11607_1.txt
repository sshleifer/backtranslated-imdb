I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable. While only 70 minutes in length I found myself still hitting the fast forward button again and again. The acting was from the school "if I scream and say a saw I am very intense". And history was at best a scenario that had yet to be explained. <br /> <br /> Even though I never go to Full Moon for making great films, I've never seen them produce a bad piece of garbage like this.
