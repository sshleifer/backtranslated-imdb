All of David Prior's films are terrible on all fronts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually chosen as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value due to their unintentional laughter. The plot of almost all of David Prior's "films" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Maniacal all-American comedians unite to blow up the bad communists. But unlike other garbage from the Cold War era like Red Dawn, Prior's movies are actually funny due to exaggerated premises and recitations. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene where Becker (or was he the other guy?) Is summoned by General Mitchell for a top secret mission in South America. The funniest part of the movie is then delivered, something with the effect of "this is my roommate, I trained him well". WHAT. Have you trained your roommate? And apparently this will be their solution to avoid eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems on the video use anywhere, BUY. They are all fun and even more fun after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka "Killer Workout". But what I recommend most about all of them is Final Sanction, with the bizarre Robert Z'dar.
