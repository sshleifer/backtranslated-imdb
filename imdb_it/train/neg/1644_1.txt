Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought that nothing would ever dethrone the last hero of the action, but this does it easily. The film is about 3 single boys who meet on Sunday to discuss their sexual adventures from the weekend. A fourth boy - who is married and - who was part of the group introduces himself and talks about what he and his wife do. Nothing works in this film. The jokes are not funny but are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the film is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
