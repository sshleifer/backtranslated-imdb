This film was made in Saskatchewan and Manitoba Parks and returned the eye of the world to that little bit of "Wild Western Canada" again. When Archie started writing his stories for the newspapers; the thought of the day was to tame the wild nature and convert / absorb the Peoples of the First Nation. <br /> <br /> The film proposes and asks the question; Why does a well-behaved, obviously talented Englishman become an Indian Archie? <br /> <br /> like an English boy dreams of becoming something, but grasping the full meaning of that dream is unique and priceless - no matter what it is. It looks like a famous puppet story, doesn't it? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I saw Archie become my living image of the "Cigar store Indian", a very wooden character and not real at all - very well done by Mr. Brosnan. He also portrayed the wild Indian in the dance scene for the tourist. The fullness or reality of it did not materialize until he met and married his wife, Annie. <br /> <br /> Annie pushed Archie in a direction that would take him to the forefront of the British world scene, not as himself but Gray Owl - a Canadian native of the wild frontier. <br /> <br /> This is the closest Archie to become the noble wild prototype. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of Mr. Brosnan as well as the directors are both well made. I saw the documentaries on Gray Owl and I think this is a good movie on the big screen to add to my collection. <br /> <br /> Spoilers - I thought the final scenes with Archie that would meet the Grand Council of leaders was great a great moment in the film. <br /> <br /> Scenery of the very beautiful Canadian lake and actual locations of "Gray Owl". <br /> <br />
