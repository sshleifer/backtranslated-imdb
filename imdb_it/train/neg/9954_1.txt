From start to finish, this is the most emotionally exciting movie on NOTHING I've ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the title character and the character of Marthe Kller are pure torture. The racetrack as a device for the metaphor is so exaggerated that it borders on the clich√©, but the director Pollack considers every turn as if it were something profoundly important. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is some value for a reinterpretation of some of the MSFT3000 scenes, such as Pacino who gets in touch with his inner woman, for an indispensable value. But even this accidental humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
