This show turned out to be a waste of 30 minutes of valuable hard disk space on the DVR. I didn't expect much and actually received less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, I can't believe that Geico will ever try to ALWAYS use the caveman advertising campaign. I would have preferred to spend a night checking my daughter's hair for lice than looking at this piece of waste. I wonder what the ABC's been through to make this show in tune with the '07 fall program, maybe a hospital / criminal / mocumentary reality show with the AFLAC duck? In case you haven't expressed my opinion about this show, let me be clear and say it's not too good.
