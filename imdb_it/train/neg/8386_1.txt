Tearing this film apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I will challenge you to recognize the positive aspects of Little Man. First of all, I am impressed by the special effects. It really seemed that Marlon Wayans' head was attached to the body of a small person. I never doubted it for a minute. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant singer, and his performances of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who, coincidentally, played Grier's father in the 1992 Boomerang (if you remember, "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom jacket) now plays Vanessa's father in Little Man. So it was fun . <br /> <br /> In addition to this, this film is as credible as the White Chicks. How stupid is it when even the doctor can't say he's a 40-year-old man and not a child? It has a complete set of teeth !!! How is it possible that nobody seems to notice that he is not a child? Little Man is so bad that there is a cameo by Rob Schneider. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least do me a favor and DON'T bring your kids. This film is too sexual for young children (lots of jokes and insinuations about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed for the parents who brought their children to the screening I was forced to endure. If you insist on watching an idiotic movie, save your children the pain and suffering.
