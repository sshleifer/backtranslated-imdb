This film seemed too long even just 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror movies is that there is always too much shooting of people walking (through the jungle, on a rocky cliff, near a river or a lake) to complete the running time. The film is worthy of being seen for the native, laughable and naked zombies, with large bulging and bleeding eyes that are always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and a lot of reverberation. Eurotrash fans will be very amused by the ugly English dubbing, the free female meat and the very silly make-up jobs on the monster and the native extras. For a zombie / cannibal this was pretty light on the blood but then I probably didn't see a full version.
