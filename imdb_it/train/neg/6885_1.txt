... in an otherwise despicable, unfortunate, aspirant comedy oedipal. <br /> <br /> I was the lonely victim of a 7:20 show tonight (3 days after the opening of the film), so there is some satisfaction in knowing that viewers take into account the warnings. <br /> <br /> Bloom is out of Jon Heder's rose. The emerging double chin is not his fault; but the fact that his obstinate child remains in another wig does not work. It would be another crime if this was Eli Wallach's last on-screen appearance. Diane Keaton will probably survive after taking this salary - in practice because so few have seen her in this, the worst vehicle she has chosen in recent weeks. <br /> <br /> Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came (laughed, too) whenever Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver the film's only three-dimensional character. He's really among our best actors. <br /> <br /> In summary, even the work of Jeff Daniels cannot redeem this image.
