SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> The fifteen-year-old bad Melissa is new in a city in the desert and not It takes a long time before people around her start dying. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of the daughter of Nancy Drew, a good girl, played by the 13th student Dana Kimmell. Local Native Americans are the first suspects because they seem to upset city prejudices. These events lead to the revelation of the killer on Melissa's sixteenth birthday. <br /> <br /> This slasher below average is not too memorable. It has a touch for the TV, without many cues besides the horny theme song of the title character that plays a couple of times. Lines like "the killer will turn us into cabbage salad". Suitable for the standard slasher scripts of the 80s. Marci calls Melissa a bad name so they somehow immediately develop a friendship. Apparently Marci sees how difficult it is to adapt because Melissa knows how to wear makeup. This film would have been difficult to make today with the main character of fifteen years and the director who has included many of his free close-ups. The social commentary on the Indians was not developed enough to be taken seriously. I'm too surprised by the fairly high rating of this film. Both the Sixty-eight birthday of Sweet Sixteen and that of Ed Hunt had the potential to take advantage of that time-honored birthday party tradition to create an intense sequence of massacres, but I don't feel up to it. But on the positive side, by releasing dark films like this on DVD, hopefully others will follow.
