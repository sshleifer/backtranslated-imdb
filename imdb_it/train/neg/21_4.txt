What was there with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film did not have a script to test the skill or ability of the actors. It required almost nothing. I bought this movie to see Michael Madsen. He's one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure for him. The script was bad. They were nothing but sinking teeth and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a jerk but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects of the gunfight the beginning of the film sounded like the sound of machine guns when they are shot in a skirmish. It was really weird and didn't look like real guns. A video game has had better sound effects than this movie. At the beginning of the film there was also a really annoying guy who was part of the gang of robbers. She had this whining American voice like a girl screaming phrases like "Lets get the F # $ k out of here" and What are we will do do man ". She seemed like a girl. laugh for a few seconds Whoo Hoo! Dumb Film. Poor Madsen.
