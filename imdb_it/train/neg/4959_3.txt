Do you remember the good old animated 90s batman show? What people praised? What people of all ages could appreciate? What showed Batman as a real detective instead of Hulk in a baseball suit? The one with the bad guys you could identify with? What had bad guys with real motivations? <br /> <br /> Of course, Warner Bros. no. So this dreck. <br /> <br /> Honestly, do these people know anything about Batman? Have they already watched a batman comic before? Do they know that Batman wanted to be a "detective"? Putting together 2 clues doesn't make you a detective! This makes you a slightly intelligent monkey! <br /> <br /> This is the basic layout for an episode: <br /> <br /> Penguin steals something. "Opening credits". Batman finds the dead gift of where he is. Batman goes there and gets into trouble. Commercial. Batman finds it obvious / stupid way out of it. Penguin flees. The penguin does something obvious again. Batman follows. They do kung-fu (about everyone, and I mean ALL those who know kung-fu for some reason). Batman's fist penguin. he is thrown out. goes to arkham. (Note: it is usually a different villain each episode) <br /> <br /> Well, as you may have noticed, Batman is not a great detective. "Joker left this piece of cotton candy on the floor, maybe it's at the old amusement park"! Yes, perhaps, it has been there the last 6 times. <br /> <br /> And I've already mentioned this, but EVERYONE knows KUNG-FU! PENGUINO ALSO! what are they thinking? (probably because it comes from the people who made that Jackie Chan animated series) <br /> <br /> What's really shocking is that the show is just action. No intelligence. None. If Batman needs to think, he will use technology, so he will do kung-fu. <br /> <br /> But hey, let's not forget the bad guys. After all, what would Batman be without his gallery of thieves? <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say, congratulations for the originality. I don't think other media batman would have imagined a joker and a mad monkey man, puzzler like an emo, and poison ivy as a minor (which is a bit confusing when you think about it, it's not his sexuality thought to be his main point of strength?) <br /> <br /> What is even more disgusting is that, every character is now a two-dimensional, stereotyped fraud. <br /> <br /> EG <br /> <br /> Killer Croc wants to invade Gotham for no reason. <br /> <br /> Man-Bat is a power-hungry mad scientist who is obsessed with bats for some inexplicable reason. <br /> <br /> Penguin just wants to steal anything. For no reason. <br /> <br /> noticing a pattern here? <br /> <br /> But the most offensive must be Mr Freeze. <br /> <br /> Do you remember the Emmy award the winning episode of "Heart of Ice" by Batman: The Animated Series? What gave Mr Freeze reasons for his crimes? The episode that was so beautiful that it was used in comics for its original story (mad scientist)? What made him a victim, with a goal? Hell, even Batman and Robin recognized him, using that as Mr. Freezes originates from that P.O.S. movie. <br /> <br /> Well, this series says "F # ck that" and makes Mr Freeze a jewel robber before his accident, with only wealth in his mind, then freezes and gives him the power to do the cold things. Then he continues to steal jewelry for no reason, while he says sh lines! T as "Have an ice day". <br /> <br /> Maybe they watched Batman & Robin after all. <br /> <br /> But hey, look on the bright side. This series does not make you feel anything for the bad guys, so it means that you are a good person. Good for you.
