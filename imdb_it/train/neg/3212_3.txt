I'm a big fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell far short of my expectations. I was expecting a heavy metal feeling from 2000 ..... slow movement, bad dialogues, a lot of blood ... but this was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot is almost the same as the comic, but the good points practically stop there. The characters don't have the energy or spirit that caught my attention in the comic book series. The film covers only a small part of the comic, and the portion used is slower and boring than the later parts. The focus in the film is on the insignificant events, instead of the overall most interesting plot of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it would have been great. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so now there is still another terrible film that few will see and even less will love. My copy will surely collect the dust for years until I throw it.
