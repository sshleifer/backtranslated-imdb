Nosy film of reform girls, which sounds a lot like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck there after escaping from his violent father. Once in prison, she is raped by her fellow "prisoners". <br /> <br /> Overlong (even at 98 minutes), with an absolutely useless ending that makes the whole film seemingly useless. /> <br /> Fifteen-year-old Linda Blair does her best not to show her body when she is naked, but lets a nipple slip during a shower scene. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *** *
