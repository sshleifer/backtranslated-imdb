Lolita is a rebel and is about to share with our eyes wide open some small stories of sex, between science fiction and fantasy ... Well, this production of Surrender Cinema is not very good: bad acting, terrifying music and a plot without any story and any line. BUT, the sex scenes are well done, lots of lesbian scenes, and Jacqueline Lovell, beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax, offers us a very good final strip show. Only for Lovell fans.
