Ok, so I went to this movie, I didn't expect much, I imagined an action movie similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars, some pretty decent girls. Unfortunately I should say that this was probably the worst movie I've seen this year. Don't get me wrong, the cars were nice and the girls were OK, but the way they put the movie together was just lousy. The story never made you interested in the cast and the film just seemed to have been put together. So, overall, this movie wasn't the worst thing ever, but if you're looking for a movie for this weekend, I'd go for it for now.
