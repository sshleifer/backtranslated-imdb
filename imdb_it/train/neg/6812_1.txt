right from the start of this film you soon realize that the name of the film has nothing to do with the film itself by looking at a naked woman who is chased by people in very silly masks to servants who run into the worst clothes they ever have seen and all this in the subtitles makes this the kind of film that you should think twice before seeing and while the film moves slowly you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire you have to know where the title comes from some parts of the film a bit of common sense with Pierre and is a father but, while the film gets to its really stupid ending, you have to think why finish a film this way and are rude if they have a better ending if it's not a movie to watch there
