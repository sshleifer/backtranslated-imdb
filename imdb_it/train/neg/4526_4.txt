Rather an insane attempt at a thriller-like Hitchcock, unlikely exchanging espionage for archeology and based on the Robin Cook novel; Incidentally, I recently acquired another adaptation of his work - COMA (1978) - in honor of the late Richard Widmark. For the record, director Schaffner had just released THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978) - an incredibly imaginative but much more compelling suspense and, unfortunately, SPHINX was a misstep from which his so impressive career would not have recovered. <br /> Despite its reach and reasonably decent cast, however, this has proved a critical and commercial flop - mainly because the narration is not very exciting: in reality, it is rather depressing (weak attempts at horror - the heroine of the archaeologist who endured burial, rotting corpses and even an attack by a flurry of bats - despite). Lesley Anne-Down is the adorable protagonist, stumbling into a lost treasure - in fact she was hidden by a local sect to prevent her from falling into the hands of foreigners, who took over much of the country's heritage (under the guise of culture) for too long. Sir John Gielgud soon appears as an antiquarian who puts down the path of loot and pays for this "act of betrayal" with his life. <br /> <br /> Typically, it transpires that some characters are the opposite of what they claim to be - so that apparent allies (like Maurice Ronet) are eventually exposed as villains, while an ambiguous figure (Frank Langella, who I saw in London in the beginning of 2007 in a show of the West End of "Frost / Nixon", which has now been turned into a film) passes from Down's antagonist to his lover and vice versa, while he decides to keep the national heritage of the Egyptian priest Menephta a national treasure.
