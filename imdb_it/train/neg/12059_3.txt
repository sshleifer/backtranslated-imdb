The 80s weren't very kind to Charles Bronson, one of the main stars of the past. Beginning in 1982, "Death Wish II" and ending with this truly gruesome 1989 film, Bronson's screenwriters seemed to be trying to overcome one another in progressive coarseness. "D.W. II" left little to the imagination in depicting the rape and suicide of the daughter of the character of Bronson, (even a rape and murder of her housekeeper were shown in disgusting fashion). "10 to Midnight" was the kind of disgusting movie that made you want to take a bath later. Nothing of redemption in this regard. Other films such as "The evil that men do" and the other "Death of death" films of this period straddled the high field and the high barf with their serious depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure that the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) had fun showing Bronson a tired and elderly elder, punk-torn enough to be his grandchildren or something, but the poor art (and the terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed the little energy they could generate. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is quite well done, but it really takes the cake into cinematic misery. In this film Bronson: sodomizes a perverse john; forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; allows a prisoner to be raped by another prisoner; makes incredibly xenophobic comments among other things that I have fortunately forgotten. Also depicted is the gang-rape of a young Japanese girl (fortunately, this was off-screen, even if well implied). <br /> <br /> What did people think when they made this film? What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films? For anyone interested in his best films, check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s like "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon til 3", "Once upon a time the West "," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rider on the Rain ", etc., Etc ...
