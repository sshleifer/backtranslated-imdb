What was the worst movie of 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" Corn not! I propose that it was this little atrocious film from before the year. Written badly, badly modified, and (if I may be so bold) misinterpreted, "The Order" is the film's black hole - a film so dense that not even the slightest entertainment can escape its suck event horizon. It's not even accidentally funny, like (for example) "Showgirls". <br /> <br /> You know that the producers are assuming that their audience will not be very intelligent. They renamed the film, originally titled "The Sin Eaters", because they thought the Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin-eater was, even if they did everything to explain what a sinner was in the film. Instead, it's a completely generic title and a photo of Heath Ledger that seems pouting is more than enough to get you in there. And, hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw the image of Heath and dragged me inside. Congratulations, producers, you have met your target market. She also liked "Grease II", so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific order (you guessed it) that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has problems with celibacy, perhaps because no one in his right mind could believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less being a single monk. The only other member of this order is a funny fat alcoholic guy. As much as I wanted to see the return of funny alcohol to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the balls in my school that made the imitations of Monty Python, thinking that if they just said the lines like the Python would become automatically funny. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say again, I risk generating spoilers. Frankly, the thing that ruined this film for me was the fact that it was created.
