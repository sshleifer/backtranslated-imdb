Ridiculous. This film is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who * bleep * Ramtha: "Ramtha is a 35,000-year-old warrior who appeared in the kitchen of JZ Knight in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims to be Ramtha's channel. Ramtha conducts sessions in which he pretends to be in a trance and speaks the Hollywood version of Elizabethan English with a guttural and hoarse voice: he has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha in seminars ($ 1,000 a crack) and his Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and sales of tapes, books and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). It must have hypnotic powers, seek self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey its command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy maze with no doors . "John Wheeler, one of the best American theoretical physicists, would turn his eyes to this film. In the recent past he has criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretation of quantum theory. This film does the same thing as those fools. <br /> <br /> There is a nice review of this movie on Skeptico. I advise anyone thinking of watching this film before reading it before contributing to the coffers of a cult. <br /> <br /> http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed a reviewer here at IMDb says to take this film with a pinch of salt. It will take enough salt to kill a horse to wade through the junk thought of this movie.
