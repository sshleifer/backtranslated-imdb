Normally, I don't like revenge movies .... PERIOD. But Double Impact has a little more than the typical premise of the plot of revenge. You see, DI has action, accuracy, exotic settings (ie Hong Kong), fantastic battles with guns and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for an impressive unarmed fight. Like all revenge movies, it has villains you would like to throw from a window on the top floor of a 40-story building! However, Double Impact has no sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist, racist and poisonous social stereotypes that have invaded "Eye for a Eye" and "Death Wish 2". <br /> <br /> the Double Impact graphic department is as transparent as the saran coating. Chad and Alex's parents were killed by a team of mass criminals who connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what I remembered. The explanation of why the boys spoke with French accents is very bad. It wasn't the aquatic plot that made this movie ugly, but the use of clich√© and other film lines (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) got worse. But still Double Impact is still watchable. But why do those shitty movies like this have bad guys (for example, that greedy British guy who killed Chad and Alex's parents and that deadly lesbian redhead) you'd like to hate with the fiber of your being?
