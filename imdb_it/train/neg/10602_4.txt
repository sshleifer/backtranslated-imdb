This film is mostly crap and the only reason it is worth watching this film is because Jean-Claud Vam Damme is the protagonist of this film. There are some action scenes in this movie and the best ones are at the end of the movie. > <br /> The acting in this film is so ugly and the worst acting I've ever seen and the two actors Bill Goldberg and Michael Jai White can't act at ALL. And this movie by far has to be one of Jean-Claud Vam Dammes the worst movies he has made and if you what to watch in one of his great films, you should watch Blood sport, KickBoxer or Sudden Death. <br /> <br /> This whole movie is shit / OK and my rating is 4 out of 10.
