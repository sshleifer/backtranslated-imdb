I wasn't as "lucky" as some of the others who commented on this film: I've never seen anything else from ... let's say ... the "fruitful" mind of Sarno. I agree with many: some actresses who spend a lot of time topless and dancing (go-go) are not that attractive. I liked Miss Crank (?) ... she was so homely, pretty! Even the acting was rather refined, although the delivery of lines in a second language could have explained a lot of this problem. Trying to follow the plot was an important task: was there one, really? I fully agree with another comment: for a vampire movie, there's not much blood. Yes, if you want a good blood movie, take a look at Hammer classics like "Horror of Dracula" and (my favorite) "Brides of Dracula". <br /> <br /> The most fun (unintentionally) part is where the doctor gets her clothes ripped from a cloud of bats ... you've never seen! ... bats, I mean. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you happen to pick it up here in the Great White North but, please, don't rent it!
