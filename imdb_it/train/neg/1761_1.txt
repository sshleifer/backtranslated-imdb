First, I realize that a "1" rating should be reserved for the worst of the worst. This film comes to mind because, as one reviewer points out, it is not bad in a conscious and extravagant way that could allow it to have some comic or cult value. He simply misses his sign at every count. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely dishonest. Continuity is so deliberate that it is painful. Daniel finishes talking about his lost love, and with his last word the flamenco dancers begin. The fake surprise of what her name is (see? I don't even remember the name of her character, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) tells her for the first time that her friend is the bad. The car and the motorbike chases have done the right things. Vegetable wagons gone flying. The cars crash into each other. Motorcycles coming down the stairs. People are almost hit, but noticeably, nobody is. Oh, it's true ... except for the one guy who was stabbed several times, he's obviously stumbling along the sidewalk with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more extraordinary that films like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you would think that someone in Hollywood would think of making films worth seeing. Now there's a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: don't see this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Don't watch it on cable. There are many other things you could do that will make you feel more satisfied.
