The dead eyes of Josh Hartnett, his dense script and Harrison Ford in a cop-friendly comedy! Here are 3 reasons to hate it, avoid it and use 116 minutes of your life better. <br /> <br /> Police movies are fun. However their true golden age dates back to the 80s and 90s. Building one that tries to mix the action and the comedy through the Hollywood police itself is certainly a good idea, but the end result of this turned out not only to be a parody of the subgenre, but a reason to ask God to have mercy of all films of the past of the same type, while the worst of them was in any case greater than (Hollywood murder). <br /> <br /> What really happened to this fun formula ?! Things hadn't been the same for a whole decade. You would have one stubborn flop after another. I will delight you with some titles to capture the disaster: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004), and the worst of all yet (Miami Vice - 2006 )! <br /> <br /> I believe that one of the reasons is the natural case of saturation after many cinema films and similar television programs for 2 decades. Add to this, particularly here, the negligent behavior and dull humor. In reality this time the question is absolutely unbearable. Yes, we have the characters of 2 loyal cops who have a second job, and the background of the sinful city, but what else was new ?! This is not a cliché; these are a few renovations mixed with clichés in which both have been hurt. <br /> <br /> Acting, especially from Hartnett, is terrible. This guy is anything but a comedian (or actor!). So his character wanted to take revenge for his father's death! Revenge on yourself man, he probably died for looking at your acting !! Even small roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or what they seem to be here anyway!). <br /> <br /> The director fails to present something comical or harsh, some parts managed to be highly boring (arresting the black guy through lack ??); It is a rare time to be boring in what is supposed to be action / comedy! They did not use Hollywood itself as an ironic place where there is an ugly face behind the superficial charm, or even as a place full of shining or falling stars (cameo that could have given him a few interesting moments). > <br /> It is a very simple film that is handed down to being guarded only by the charm of its stars, and like a Buddy-cop movie to end up as one of the worst 2-star cases with non-chemistry on the screen (one of them has no chemistry with the screen itself! Guess who?), and a Buddy-Cop destroyer more than a movie! God, don't let me live, or my children, live long enough to testify (Hollywood Homicides? Part 2)! In the end, he watched Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted to have fun, but at least we didn't.
