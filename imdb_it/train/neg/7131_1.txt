I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip them for their duration. Then there are aberrant films like this. Redline is not just a bad film, but a sign that perhaps the American film industry should, for the pleasure of the viewer, at least satisfy the correction scripts before funding a film. <br /> <br /> If a stereotype took a shit, this movie would generate from that. The plot is unbearable and the acting is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a long time, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change profession to street merchants (on only thing they can legitimately qualify for). Furthermore, as Angus Macfadyen has convinced himself to make this film, it is so beyond me that I cannot even think of an analogy. I'm a faithful fan, but this made me question him. <br /> <br /> To summarize. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it turns into violence (I guess). The film is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its tail, as it is an endless cycle of confusion and dialogues not suited to human ears. This film is essentially a great advertisement for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest should be avoided at any cost. <br /> <br /> I wish I could find a positive aspect in this film, and I think it's due to the fact that eventually the credits turn out. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if you were singing those two songs in this movie, then you're a hack, and I hope old age hurts you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie in search of a laughable experience, listen to the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's fantastic songs.
