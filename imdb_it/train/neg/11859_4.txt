Well, you'd better if you're going to sit through this amateur, bland, and pokey movie about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a little more in common with her young adult or old daughter than she would like. Set in Tunis, the mother wanders around the apartment, becomes irritable and decides, though reluctantly (she just can't stop herself), wearing a costume and dancing in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, his daughter is taking dance lessons. The common denominator is a drummer of the Tunisian band. This film is so full of fillers that I watched the DVD in x2 and read the subtitles, fast forwarding through most of the ordinary dances and sooooo to walk (walk everywhere) and more on foot and just loitering x4 just to get this boring blow, without incident, on a limited budget, which some have picked up some nice critical acclaim. Go figure. (C-)
