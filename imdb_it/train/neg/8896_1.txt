I saw Brigadoon on TV last night (September 12th 2009). I'm 61 years old and I've watched movies for as long as I remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon stands alone as by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The accents were shameful. The local children's club would have produced better sets. The characters were so wooden that they had probably contracted the dry rot by the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to observe them. It is to be hoped that the stars of this film hide themselves often enough to protect them from the embarrassment they must have suffered in seeing this movie. The owners of this tripe should offer a great service to humanity and destroy all copies of this film.
