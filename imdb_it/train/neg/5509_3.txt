When I was a kid in the 50s and 60s, anything connected with Disney was by definition exceptional. What happened? I can get the actors and actresses they want, the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to ruin everything despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, the best producers and directors, but still ... they ruin things! This movie sucks. The sad thing is that I suspect that Disney in their arrogance doesn't even know when a movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> It is only thanks to the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 of 10.
