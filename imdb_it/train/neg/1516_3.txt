Although THE FLOCK has a rather good acting of the veteran Richard Gere, and some right shots that could recall some days of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, the film extends credibility to the breaking point and is destroyed by a plot that does not lead anywhere. . br /> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere) who works for the security department and is preparing to retire. His office pushes his replacement, Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST) on him, who quickly discovers that Babbage is obsessed with his job. And that job isn't much fun. Monitor hundreds of sex offenders who are on probation in his jurisdiction. Allison accompanies Erroll on many calls to verify her "flock" of criminals and learns that she desperately needs to retire. But Erroll is good at his job even if his methods are not. He taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. Erroll justifies his actions by raising the past of these deviants. It is this "good justification" that challenges the audience to a certain level, allowing us to see how brutal Erroll is and how much he has become out of time (being too close to his job). <br /> <br /> When a teenager disappears into Erroll's "zone", she immediately leaps to the conclusion that she was kidnapped by one of her flocks. But how could he know? Is Erroll good at his job? Allison challenges him and Erroll rejects him. Their battles become as fierce as Erroll's need to find this missing girl. <br /> <br /> Although the story set-up was ok, it had no umpf! I will give credit to Richard Gere, however, who plays the character of Erroll very well. The struggling pension. Concerned about all those close to his flock. Disgusted with those responsible for supervision. Disgusted with himself for having to do some things he does. A nice change in the representation of the characters for Gere. But beyond him there is not much else. Some sets are ok (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I will be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement every time you watch a movie. But that suspension has its limits. The biggest push against these limits is the destruction of EXTREMELY vital crime scenes. Someone as meticulous as Erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no-no. Or trampling on a crime scene. Or mobile proof. He went further and wounded the film to the end. <br /> <br /> The other detrimental part of this film is that we never enter the character of Clair Danes, Allison. At the end of the film he almost left his mark and we never know what his intention might be: will he stay or will he leave? Will it end up as Erroll if it stays? This is not a horrible film as it touches on some uncomfortable moral reasons, but the story as a whole needs to be strengthened.
