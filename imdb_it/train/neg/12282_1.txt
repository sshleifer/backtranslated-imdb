This was one of the most boring "horror" movies I've ever seen. A college boy has an epidemic of nightmares involving wandering spirits in Alcatraz. Trying to offer a mix of "Nightmare on Elm Street" and standard vampire cymbals in the form of an ugly 80s music video, this film is full of bad acting and an extremely slow story. Although, being a film so ugly and often laughable (digging those mullets and the terrible dialogue), it would be good material for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being 1987 Silver Scroll Award winner of the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy and Horror, or that I must contribute to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil has a part in the film. It's a gigantic disaster, albeit with a small sequel (see IMDb's other comments for this film).
