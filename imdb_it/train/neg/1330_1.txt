There is a reason why Jay Leno himself will not recognize this film. It consistently ranks as one of the worst movies of all time. The acting is horrible, the script lacks direction and the director himself doesn't seem sure which way to take this movie. "A film friend", "an action / comedy", "mystery". It seems halfway, surrenders, and it's just for the ride. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It is a pity that they wasted their time and their gifts making this movie mess. Before getting involved in this, Jay Leno and Pat Morita had spent years hammering their trades on the Hollywood circuit. Mr. Morita had already been a star in his own right, constantly acting since the mid-1960s as the protagonist of these cult TV and film classics like "Happy Days", and the sad but affable "Mr. T and Tina". And he conquered the heart of America with his roles in the powerful movie "Midway", "The Karate Kid" and a host of others. Mr. Leno can be seen on television programs dating back to the mid-70s. And he was one of the best performers in American comedy clubs. It can be seen in countless TV commercials and in the most important films. It is a pity that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
