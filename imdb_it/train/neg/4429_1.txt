What a piece of stupid tripe. <br /> <br /> I will not waste time evaluating any of the points of this show. It's not worth it. The only comment I will make is: why get such a DUMB, inarticulate doofus to be the star?!? <br /> <br /> There are not many sad testimonies for the worsening mental condition of the networks compared to the fact that FOX has stated that it will NOT bring back John Doe (a decent series), but will bring back brain brains like Joe Millionaire for another round of brain cell killing by the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX lost it, IMHO.
