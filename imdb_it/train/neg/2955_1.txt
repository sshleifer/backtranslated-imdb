Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine it at a friend's dinner and add a comment to the ongoing political discussion. People look at her and say, "Oh what would you know, you were the star of 'Theodore Rex'". How could anyone take her seriously after lowering herself to be the protagonist of this scary piece of shit? Even small children are ashamed of this. It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of "Sigmund And The Sea Monsters". Actually, come to think of it, 'Sigmund' was far superior to this. <br /> <br /> And was it done anyway? Do you address the producer to an illegal substance before talking to him about it? Watch this horrible abomination at your own risk.
