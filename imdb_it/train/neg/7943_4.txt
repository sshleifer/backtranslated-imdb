THE SEVENTH SIGN has a big opening hook while the Israeli defense force meets a terrorist base. This is the kind of hook that is mandatory when writing a script, grabs the reader / audience and David Bannon's introduction while renting a room from Abby and Russell Quinnn telegraphing to the point that this is a man who is not who he says that it is. However, after the great third opening, I found the rest of the film confused and uninvolving with a large number of plots and it is not all that different from other supernatural thrillers I've seen
