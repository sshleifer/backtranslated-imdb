I have read some of the other comments and I must agree with those who did not get the ending. I thought it was pretty good ... until the end. He kept making your mind work and then splitting. I have no idea what happened in the last two minutes of the film, except for a complete mess. It's like they ran out of money to find a good ending, so they improvised. Before they had a mysterious thing that made people disappear, then they had a guy who talked about Area 51 (which makes you think of aliens) and then after it went bad. I thought actors and actresses did well, only the script became sour. However, if you watch this movie, be prepared to be disappointed in the end.
