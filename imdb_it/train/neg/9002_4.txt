OK .... I only have 3 words - cheese, cheese and CHEESY! The only thing that redeems this film is Dean Cain. In addition to this - it is CHEESEBALL SUPREME !!!! <br /> <br /> The film has some promises in the concept - an underground laboratory creates a real dragon that breathes live - basically giving us more than "Jurassic Park" meets "Reign of Fire" ..... There are some great possibilities, but they simply don't follow ... The special effects are decent - even if you KNOW that the dragon is CGI, it doesn't look horribly like CGI .... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't blame Dean Cain ( even if he is one of the producers), I would give more responsibility to Phillip Roth - the director and the writer. It's his job to make this film .... and, unfortunately, he failed.
