More than a mysterious film with some free horror elements thrown in; mediocre in general. <br /> <br /> Start with a woman who has a nightmare where her sexual partner gets out of bed, enters her crying baby's room and kills him. She wakes up. So, that man is dying in a hospital, spitting blood. Her foreign daughter arrives and manages to contact her through her dreams (I think), and wants her to find out who killed him before his body completely decomposes in his grave. <br /> <br /> There is not too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have understood this long before it is revealed. I'm not sure the way he was killed would really work. <br /> <br /> However, the elements of horror come into play: a bloody autopsy, the recurring dream of the man who kills the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turns into eyes that they are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and in the grave. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see a dedication at the end of Fulci to Clive Barker! Interesting.
