This movie is pretty boring. There are fragments of naked flesh thrown in a lame attempt to keep the spectator awake, but they can't. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is Lena Olin: she does a masterful job handling her character, but Day-Lewis draws most of her lines. <br /> <br /> Kaufman clearly had no idea how to film it. Incongruities in rebounding between domestic / matrimonial issues and political crises are mismatched. The characters' attitudes change without explanation all the time. Poorly disjointed.
