Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon <br /> <br /> Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon Who usually associates with extremely goradi horror films like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, made a little detour here and did a little science fiction movie. I underline the word "small" since it is a very low budget film, and here is its main weakness. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in the future. A world in which the great superpowers (which according to this film are the United States and Russia) challenge their differences by not going into a full-blown world war ... but fighting gladiator-style battles with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must face the evil Russian robot fighter, Alexander. A lot of economic stop motion animation follows. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is fantastic, I guess. Do great nations establish territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been correctly managed if the adequate budget was available. Unfortunately, what could have been a funny movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise exceptional director. <br /> <br /> As a child I adore this movie, and I imagine that if you want to enjoy this movie, I'll have to go back to kid mode to have some fun. I showed this movie to some of my friends and as the movie progressed, my friends said "what the hell is this piece of frank shit?" And do I like that this film is a science fiction by one of my favorite directors, Stuart Gordon? "But as the film progressed in an insipid territory, I almost felt like a pressing stop and didn't subject them to this torture, because I loved this movie as a child, and there's still a bit of nostalgia to see it. But all the others would not have understood it. <br /> <br /> And I myself understood that the film is not First of all, the film is about giant robots chasing each other out and, to achieve this credibly, you should use some damn special effects to make it work, expensive effects this would help the public to suspend disbelief, but unfortunately this is a small-scale film, from a small company (Empire Pictures, which went bankrupt after doing this movie!), the effects only help us to chuckle and laugh at them, sets and part of the wardrobe seems unfinished or semi-embedded. <br /> <br /> OK granted, once you accept that you are looking at a mixture of moderate animation and miniatures, you can give a kind of surrender to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking each other. There are certain scenes where the robots are fighting that are pretty cool, and they made me go "that's why I liked that movie!" But everyone knows and they, a bad effect will take you away from that little protective cocoon you were trying to hide. And boom, your right to make this film is not up to its premise. <br /> <br /> And here's another thing that bothered me a little about the movie. This film is basically a film for children. You know, giant robots that are destroying it? Stop motion animation? Hello? But this cinematic dialogue has had many sexual allusions and the violence becomes a bit bloody. So I kept asking myself is a film for children or not? After a while I came to the conclusion that basically it was a film for children with sensitivity for adults, which in reality is not a good mix. <br /> <br /> So for those of you who don't feel naive childish charm of looking at two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic bond with this movie (like I do) well Id suggest you stay away from this. Gordon is a great director, but the film he made didn't do it for me. Well, at least not now that I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
