I'll be honest, this is one of the worst movies ever. If not, then it is VERY close. Have you ever seen a bad teenage soap opera? Well, this is like one of those. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLY SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> boy: all we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I want to take me somewhere else. <br /> <br /> boy: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... Proceeding on this line they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. The personalities of the characters and events completely change. Moreover, only things are freed. Furthermore, the film ends before the book ends. It's an AWFUL movie. So if you haven't read the book, don't look at it. If you read the book, burn it (the film). If you like stupid teen soap operas that are inferior in quality to your low quality medium soap opera, try it. Then again, should we expect anything other than MTV?
