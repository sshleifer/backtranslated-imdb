Forward spoiler - proceed with your same caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that once Harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers - with relative ease - he continues to dig into their demands. And then the whole scene with his wife is kidnapped, he decides to wire his vintage car until it explodes (with money in it), which makes us take a big leap of logic. <br /> <br /> Ok, so he wanted to keep his relationship with Cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the DA campaign. This I can see, but why not hire someone to slap these rags a little, or even kill them when he has established that there is no blackmail test (eg. Cini's body?) This was a rather interesting movie first 2/3 of it. After that, it falls apart.
