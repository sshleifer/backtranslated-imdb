*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do it, and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see how this is a film that might seem as good as a script, but it is twisted, unlikely and ultimately silly. I saw the pretended death finish a mile away. Rene Z. tries with a written part, and also Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can't remember (which is not Chris Penn) is a very sweaty actor. Watch it if you're not smart enough to distinguish between a movie that's so smart you can't follow it and so confused that you can't understand it. Look at it if you like the cheesy camera work makes you feel seasick. Watch it if you like to watch Tim Roth work with a cumbersome script. Watch him if he arrives late at night for free. Otherwise, rent The Usual Suspects.
