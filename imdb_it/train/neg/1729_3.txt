... and how they bore you from your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies of the 70s made without actors of any kind, an embarrassing script, a painful direction and a tireless desire to blend "horror" with light comedies. This film introduces a paleontologist who finds the drawings of an aquatic dinosaur under Crater Lake ... a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Lake Crater. The whole thing is taken care of by Steve, our local sheriff. Much of the film - when it shows no pools of blood left behind by what we imagine must have been the beast's restaurant - is passed by following the nonconformity of two boys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental place. They try so badly to be funny, that we have lines like, looking at a business sign, Mitch telling Arnie "You have the wrong syllable, it's written B-A-T-E." The laughter was rather poor here. We see them then get drunk and imagine a tree trunk like the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy beware! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is funny in a wrong way. And at least the lake is beautiful.
