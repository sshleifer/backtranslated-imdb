With all the due disrespect for this "epic" by George Stevens Sr. of miscastations and misunderstandings, I can only wonder that the "legend" of James Dean can survive this release, I stress that the "giants" tributes in the studio box office arrived collector of his 'gigantismosi'. Neither Rock nor Liz were much better. Let's just say that the "Dallas" television was the true "heir", even if the contemporary "Texans" (like Lay and Delay), not to mention our alleged "president" of these States of Yewbenighted of Amurrika, perform a one-upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions. I never read the original by Edna Ferber, but I will throw oddities higher than what appeared on the screen. And all the well-paid, I imagine, "supporting" notable actors and celebrities despite, "Giant" is, for me at least, a dwarf of deserved merit, no matter the promotional campaigns.
