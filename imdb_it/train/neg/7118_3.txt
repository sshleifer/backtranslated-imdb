I couldn't say if "The Screaming Skull" was trying to be a rip-off of Hitchcock or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. These days, someone would have cropped it a little and presented it as one of those episodes of television anthology from the old "Tales From The Dark Side" ... but only after extensive rewriting. <br /> <br /> the sad thing is that there seems to be a nice, bad story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie, and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with their talent and material they have to work with. But the director didn't really know how to stage or mark a dramatic scene; the special effects simply didn't work; the script telegraphed its frayed plot so clearly that a bivalve could have seen them arrive; and the soundtrack continued to play "oompah band" German music when it was supposedly trying to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> They tried; they tried really hard. But this is only interesting for a while. I suppose someone very young who hasn't seen much suspense or horror can get the job of "The Screaming Skull", but someone who probably wouldn't have had most of the subtext or motivation of the plot. ("Mammy, why is that nice man trying to scare the little cat lady?")
