This is a bad movie. Not one of those funny and bad ones. This is a bad bad. In reality it was painful to watch. The direction was terrible, with lots of jumps around and the green and yellow tones used throughout the film make the characters look sickly. Keira Knightly was not at all convincing as a tough girl, and I can't believe that Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke have signed up for this criminal celluloid waste. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails on a blackboard. If you haven't seen it, don't do it. You don't miss anything and you'll only lose two hours of your life watching this mess. I've seen bad movies before and I even liked them because of their flaws. This is just a waste of time.
