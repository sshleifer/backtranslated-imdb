I had some expectations for the film, since it had a nice cast of stars and is the return of the duo of Akshay and Saif. Well, I was hesitant to watch the movie because this was done by the same man who wrote the story for the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say that Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because it was presented nicely. Well, the first scene itself has left me out. So the main drawback of the film is the action sequences. My friends and I were laughing out loud as we watched these nasty fights. He was like Akshay against thirty thugs and all the thugs even have machine guns! Phew ... you have to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the film is the story too predictable. It reminded me of some of the first 80s movies. <br /> <br /> Well, the only thing that is worth the movie is the sexy Kareena, who seemed really sexy in this. And for this, I give a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Boys, please ... please ... you don't see it thinking it's a real gangster movie. Well, you can watch this to have a laugh at the terrible fight scenes. <br /> <br /> That's it.
