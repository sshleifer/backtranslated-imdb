Anyone who has seen Tammuz's Child Eaters knows that this is a director who knows how to do better. Let's hope it's not a case of too many hands in the pot (Telefilm anyone?) And this was a case of second level nervousness. The characters are one-dimensional and overused. The scenery is still exceptional and shows the Pacific Northwest beautifully. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is fantastic. Shot almost completely out, the images are sharp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. <br /> <br /> Technically, this film is as sonorous as they are: just one heart is missing.
