The worst thing about Crush is not that he behaved quite badly, or that the plot is practically non-existent, and it's not so bad that the photographic work could have been better. <br /> <br /> No, the worst part of this film there are some absolutely brilliant moments that make you hope that there are others to come. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's too little, too late. If you are a fan of violin music and cheap tearing scenes of 40+ women who cry and hug and talk about children and weddings - then, absolutely, don't lose. <br /> <br /> I myself am not exactly thrilled to see the things listed above in a movie, and as a result I had a rather horrible time. The few genial jokes cannot make up for the rest. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 4/10. Guilty of wasting time. <br /> <br />
