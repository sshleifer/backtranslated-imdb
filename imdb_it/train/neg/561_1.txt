Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it is - unfortunately - worse than you might think. First of all, the plot is idiotic, it doesn't make any sense. The script is full of deliberately funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. The actors act like this, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who has good moments but also terribly bad moments of acting. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like "I want * beep * you" and looks, let's say it kindly, a very very mature woman who acts rude and not at all sexy. That erotic tension from BI1 has completely disappeared. From a technical point of view, Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre film - better than usual directly on DVD, but on a much lower lever than the original film. For example the scene of crazy race is badly done. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is not Paul Verhoeven and shows. The new composer is not Jerry Goldsmith and his shows. The script is made by people who are not up to Joe Eszterhas. There is no substitute for Michael Douglas. The film seems cheap and badly modified at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after leaving the theater was: "Why didn't they make this film before and with the original talents behind the success of the first film?" All in all the original film is like Citizen Kane with respect to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a sort of break-thru in popular cinema. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. He had the best performance of Sharon Stone in his career. He had this specific style of Paul Verhoeven. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is an unwittingly entertaining, misdirected film and a sure winner of the Razzie award in many categories. It is a pity that they made this film.
