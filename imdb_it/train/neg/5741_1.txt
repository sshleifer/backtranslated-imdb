<br /> <br /> I am a big fan of horror / science fiction regardless of the budget, but after seeing countless late-night horror movies on cable and video, this must be the worst of all the movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again) and the people running around screaming from the left, then to the right, then back again. It should have remained with the opening scene of the convenience store and stopped there and lasted 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged very long. It is very, very small x5 budget. Many scenes were very, too long. The narrator seemed very amateurish, as if a randomly youthful person was talking. This is the only film that I think is lower than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla vs megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 naps, try to stay awake through the whole movie in one scenario or, better yet, avoid it as if you were a mass of undead brains eaters.
