This film was terrible. OK, my favorite movie is "The Wicker Man" (1973), so I've always been a little biased. <br /> <br /> The plot proceeds, eliminating enough key elements of the original to make the term "remake" very questionable. (He is not a virgin, but he is allergic to bees. WOW!) There are so many things that make no sense and are inexplicable, and I fear that Mr LaBute is not a horror movie. (In what ways did two people we saw clearly explode in a car at the beginning alive and well at the end of the film?) Cage looks upset and baffled, and his character is inclined to shout "Rowan !?" at the least noise. The 'hints of mention' to the original are irritating as they present themselves as a tribute rather than an intelligent tribute. For example, some incidents reflect the original (The girl who falls from a closet pretending to be dead when Woodward / Cage is looking for the island) and several lines of dialogue are extracted directly from the original screenplay by Anthony Schaffers and fitted like a glove. <br /> <br /> I'm sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis of this, I can't really worry about writing more about this movie. Missing any kind of substance. Throw it on the scrap pile with all the other remakes that have stained the good names of the movies they were "based" on (in this case very loosely).
