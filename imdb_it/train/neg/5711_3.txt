The national treasure is overestimated and overestimated as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero and this film is not "Indiana Jones". People who have compared this film to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously lost the rocker. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand what kind of target audience was shot for this movie. Perhaps the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it absolutely ridiculous. I can't even imagine adults or young adults to discover that this is the great film. Simply put: it is simply OK at best. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is unimaginable and uninspired, borrowing what it has from "The Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for the film to be released in 2006 and to pass on this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​being able to steal the Declaration of Independence so easily and travel around Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (without ever damaging it once), while fighting the "bad guys" and experiencing what should be "non-stop action" is absurd. I particularly enjoyed the scene with the Declaration folded into its tube which is located in the middle of a busy street, while the cars whizzing by it without damaging it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> Reminds me of that "Brady Bunch" episode where they go to the amusement park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plans. Except that the Brady Bunch episode was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a great treasure that no one believes exists to be buried in a secret US ruin is extravagant. Literally, there are thousands of "priceless" objects not discovered in this treasure chest. Yeah, for sure!! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> Even worse, the speed and accuracy that Cage finds and understands what the "hard" clues of these ancient riddles should be are preconstitutions !!! Oh humanity! <br /> <br /> The performances of Cage, Voight and the other actors of "National Treasure" are stiff, wooden and flat as they come. However, when you work with such bad dialogues, it's hard to criticize 100% of the actor for this. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an OK movie to see once. I cannot recommend it beyond this and I will definitely NOT buy it over the bizarre treasure hunt of a casino. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you need to see it first .......
