Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly intelligent illiterate of all time. This film is so wasteful of talent, it's really disgusting. The script is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and it's not funny. The film moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in a reckless manner, and is unbearably a preacher. It also links all the cliches in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but then? <br /> <br /> Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule that requires ten lines for each review. When a film is worthless, it does not require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this movie.
