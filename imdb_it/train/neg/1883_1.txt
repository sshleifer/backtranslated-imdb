I didn't think it could be done, but something came and replaced Open House - a low budget horror for someone who kills over the high price of real estate - like the worst movie I've ever seen in my short but for the rest sweet life. <br /> <br /> It was advertised as the best film of the most recent Montreal film festival, which leads me to believe that every other voice should consist of blank wall shots accompanied by people reading dark poetry. > <br /> Watching this movie was like a small slice of hell. Comes from Austria and tries to stumble in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet, scenes of various characters living in a suburban area with a dark side. There is the fat man's master and the plump wife stripping him, the thin divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the intact room of her dead child, the hateful hitchhiker-woman who plays the first ten lists. The list could continue. Forever. Just like the two extra hours spent in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters interact, but not in an intelligent, interesting or even relevant way. I couldn't say if they were as good as actors, since, according to the subtitles, they were given verses that were the Austrian equivalent of "You're so lame!" Certainly they did not need to learn many, since everyone repeated his own jokes at least three times in a scene. <br /> <br /> This is not Gummo, or any of the films mentioned above. There is no art to discover and there is nothing to think about later except maybe if you should or should not change your "never go out during a movie" policy (which some elderly couples did during a random orgy scene - and if it sounds appetizing, it is not, unless you are one of the few not to find the idea that your parents have sex - and with some local middle-aged couples, to bathe - rebelling). <br /> <br /> This film was offensive to me. Not the flaccid nudity, not the soundtrack that leads to anger, not the shocking scenes involving guns. It offended me that someone actually spent money doing it when there are capable writers and filmmakers looking for funding. I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if it was the best Montreal could find. Above all, I felt offended that, somehow, the people involved in the festival deceived everyone into believing that the emperor had a splendid new and charming dress when it was painfully clear that he was naked as the fat wife who did a striptease. <br /> <br />
