This movie is BAD! It's basically an exaggerated copy of Michael Jackson's Thriller video, only worse! The special effects consist of a lot of glow in the dark paint, freaky slapstick that quickly skips the photos of the camera and a lot of snarl. I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie.
