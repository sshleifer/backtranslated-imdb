First and foremost this film, according to Slick, said he won the "best film" at the "Worldfest" film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the worst film of all time but it certainly sucks, it's practically as terrible as other "Apart from Melissa", but at least the film didn't seem to have been shot on the HI 8 video. < br /> <br /> My hypothesis is that of the directors, I have seen many Troma films and some bad quality B movies, thinking that they too could be created in the business that frees this film. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love low-level movies, just the fact that some of the characters put up fake American accents, almost as if we'd be more likely to sell them in the states or something. Even the really disappointing ending, the showdown could have been much more exciting, and some good fighting scenes. You can see completely that the directors are trying to copy "Bad Taste" with the whole, explosion of machines, rocket launchers and an infinite number of people who are killed by gunshots, however the ending is lacking in superior humor or of a style like "bad" taste ". <br /> <br /> If you like watching tacky movies, or are interested in making films without a budget, watch it, otherwise stay away.
