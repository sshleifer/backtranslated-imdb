I thought the film was a poor documentary. Nothing of substance was discussed. It seemed to resize the ideas and not provide anything new. The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that could really push science. Most scientists have appeared "stereotyped" and sometimes strange. One woman said her rewards were not important, only the children who had been helped. He said that after a 10-minute scene in which he explained all his awards. Playing "humble scientist", are we? "I have equations dancing in my head," said another. I don't see how this explains something to us. It has not covered significant effects of science on our culture. The politics of science has just been touched. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie for 10-14 year olds. In addition to this, I felt it was boring and not revealing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
