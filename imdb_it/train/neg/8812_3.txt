Unfortunately, realism is boring. This film, I thought it would never end, it would have been better if all the characters had been captured in the first five minutes. Where is Blade when you need him? As shabby as a COMBAT SHOT, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM and nightmare like BOISE MOI, DEAD CREATURES isn't as fun as any of the aforementioned desolate films. While free cannibalism could make Jeffery Dalmers' heart, the most desirable, that runs a little faster, it was not as interesting as RAVENOUS. Really, I found it as interesting as the late-night infomercials, and as exciting as a trip to the dentist. If you have strong masochistic qualities, you may be able to endure this, otherwise, for no one. I was really surprised that this was not created by the people of Brain Damage as it was the quality of Dead Creatures.
