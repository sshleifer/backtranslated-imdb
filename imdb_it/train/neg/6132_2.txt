As a child, my friends and I believed that Gymkata was the most violent and bloody film ever made. I'm not sure who started that voice. He was probably born of the frustration of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to see them for one reason or another. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a perennial film in the late evening and, as a result, I managed to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes of this terrible excuse for a movie more than a dozen times, and I can always spot it for 1-2 seconds on the screen. However, apart from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the ugly dubbing, the hard dialogue, and the scandalously difficult plot, the film has some things going on. With all that is bad about the film visually, the sound is actually quite funny. Never before has a punch or a kick landed with so little strength and so much volume! The canned kung-fu sounds are cheeky, but the slow, high-pitched music and almost 5-minute slow-motion scene are really weird. The chase through the city of demented bloodthirsty villagers is not as tense as it is irritating, and there are enough ugly wigs and extras that do nothing but look into the camera and say goodbye to make this train a little fun. Could it be directed to cult-classic status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
