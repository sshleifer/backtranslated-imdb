I'll say it again: this film was totally lame. Children will like it, sure, but adults ... doubtful. The whole thing was basically a remake of the original, which is predictable, since they practically explored the whole concept in the first movie, but still, did they have to shoot the whole movie completely? I mean, everything is redone by the Little Mermaid. The worst part is Morgana, Ursula's "crazy sister" who appears out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous since Triton is there with his magic trident. Why didn't Triton do anything about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I won't. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to collect more money from the Little Mermaid, and was obviously thrown together without any thought, because they knew he would sell. Overall it's a terrible waste of time.
