If you've read the book - don't put your hopes up high, if you didn't - go and read it and never watch the movie. It is strange to learn that Toby Young was very involved in writing the script (as stated in the script of the book). Because the film is very different from the book. <br /> <br /> What the film seems to focus on, taking a rather challenging and fun piece that combines philosophical ideas with simple amusing sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone can understand it - reaches with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suited to a sitcom and has lost any meaningful message it could have had. <br /> <br /> You're better off without seeing it.
