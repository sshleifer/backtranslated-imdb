I have to admit that I only saw a handful of episodes, but each seemed completely different from the next. It seems that after the first season, the producers have decided to completely reorganize the show, release characters, present new ones and rewrite the whole dynamic of the show. <br /> <br /> As you have probably already assumed, the show will cover the eccentric, the unpredictable teenage Holly (Amanda Bynes) who moves with her sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to New York. Fairly good premise: strange couple + fish out of the water + high bad luck. <br /> <br /> While I miss the sitcoms of the past, unfortunately this show misses the mark on fun, and is sad because they have decent talent. <br /> <br /> Above all, they insisted on changing the show (Val lived with a regular cast in one season, then suddenly he left, then opened a bakery? what?) When things happened they change that drastically, you have the feeling that even the * show * knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, deleted characters and new regular customers! <br /> <br /> In a side note (this is just the picky), I know this is a TV show and it's not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a huge two-story loft (there are stairs) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
