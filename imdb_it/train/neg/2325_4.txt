the first Scanners might not have been a great movie, but at least it was original. There is no news like this. Acting is worse, in my opinion, and the story is slower and nothing special. like dialogue. and the special effects are no better than those of the original. This film is inferior to the first in all ways. The only thing different about it is that it is sometimes loud and chaotic. But that doesn't make him make a good film. If they had done something better with the story and made it interesting, this could have been a decent film. Actually I couldn't get past everything without a quick reversal through it. For me, this is a forget movie, and not much else. Despite everything, there are worse films. Being in a generous mood, I'll give Scanner 2 a 4/10.
