I'm not sure that Carpenter is trying to raise questions about abortion and make the heaviest and most obvious point that a woman should be allowed to abort if Satan is the father, but he crawls back and forth. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The child is really stupid, practically a crab with a child's head mounted on it. You can practically see Satan's costume material. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of boredom. Very very bad. And the ending is simply ridiculous. After learning that your child is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, bloody, riot? NO! He just put his head down and pouts out of the room. Terrible.
