I watched the whole movie, waiting and waiting for something to really happen. Maybe it's my fault if I expect evil and horror instead of psychology? It's a strange re-narration of the Oedipal myth: do I want to kill my father and my mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I didn't understand why some elements of the plot were still present: because the construction was upstairs, because there was a big stairwell with a perfect place where someone could fall into their ruin if no one had done it, because the scenes for nothing with the father at work, because having a kitchen so beautiful if you're just going to eat to take away, because the boy would like to be baptized and the parents have to resist instead of the opposite. I see many good reviews for this film ... has my taste been corrupted by the b-movies of the 70s and old science fiction movies?
