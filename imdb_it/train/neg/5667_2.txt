If I had checked IMDb before renting this DVD from Netflix, I would have had a couple of hours back of my life. I'm frankly suspicious when I see that even the director of a film wrote it. In this case, according to the credits, the same boy was "writer and director" - unfortunately, an indication of the general quality of this production. There were some interesting moments (eg, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded her of her first plays that played Judy-ism) which led me to evaluate these two stars rather than one. Those moments, however, were few and far between ... and I hardly saw them because the opening sequence was almost incomprehensible to me, not to say reprehensible in its violence. I admit that I went back to looking at that part again to see if I had lost something that would help me understand it once I saw it all. No, even if at least I recognized who the characters were that would prove to be important later. The "camera" technique was abused and essentially useless. I found myself talking to the TV screen: "What?!?" or "For heaven's sake, agree!" Not recommended.
