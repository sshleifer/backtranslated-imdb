To increase the drama of this sweaty story of motherhood, it is set in a special department for "difficult cases". The main story is by Loretta Young; is on leave from a long prison for murder. Will the doctors save your child at the cost of his life, or will they consider the husband's opposition? Melodrama and feeling are dominant, and I am not the honest type, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho department next to the maternity ward, and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander to steal children. <br /> <br /> There is only enough laughter and sarcasm for this is recognizable as a Warner movie, mostly of Glenda Farrell, who turns from her hot water bottle while waiting to have twins who to his regret, he discovers that there is now a law against the sale. An example of his response order: "Be careful". Farrell: "It's too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon is obviously authoritative as the principal nurse, but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is that the sight of a child turns everyone into a mush. Even considering the obvious limitations, this film should have been better than it is.
