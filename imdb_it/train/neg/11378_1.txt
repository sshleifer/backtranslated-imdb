The guys from MST3K should see this dog from a movie. It's basically a Hollywood junkie actor who can't do any shows. And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver. So what does this stupid actor do? He dyes his blond hair and starts acting like a lover of L.A. in the naive hope that this can get him acting roles. You'll head to so many inadvertently funny scenes from this movie. Like when the actor's girlfriend has a broken and sobbing heart and says phrases like "How could you do this to me?" And why are you crying? Because he dyed his hair blond and became a surfer guy to get acting concerts. This movie doesn't make sense for EVERYONE! The actor who played the governor on Benson is also in this and plays a right-wing political stereotype with a silly and funny dialogue. This movie will make you collapse, trust me. Are you talking to me ?!
