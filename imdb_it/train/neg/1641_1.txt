This movie is not funny. It's not funny. It does not contain a single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it make you take the slightest interest in the characters or the situation. Add to this that it is a youthful film like anything in recent memory. It is as if a group of fourteen or fifteen-year-old boys who had never met or had any kind of relationship with a real girl had sat down and written a film based on their erroneous fantasies about what an adult man would be like. This film is boring, unpleasant and sometimes offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Furthermore, it seems to be twice as long as 85 minutes.
