I saw it on DVD (it's known as CORRUPT in this format) and the blurb on the case really enhanced the way Harvey Keitel Frank's character is so similar to what he played BAD LIEUTENANT in "This brave and powerful thriller police ". What the case did not say is that this is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music, he doesn't put the CD player, he takes out a big plastic thing, he puts it on some sort of rotating table where a kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake that makes the music heard. Do you see my point of view on the fact that it's an old movie? The DVD case gave no idea that it was a film made 20 years ago. It is also a film with low production values ​​like so many other Italian films disguised as Americans. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is very bad even though Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre and not terrible, cinematography is static, with the quality of the image and the sound that gives the impression that I was looking at a fourth generation pirate copy (I don't know if it's a dark DVD or if it's a bad film press) and the worst thing is the score of Ennio Morricone. It is impossible to believe that the man who made the irritating accidental intrusive music for CORRUPT is the same one who made the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns. <br /> <br /> All this is a pity because CORRUPT has its moments. It is by no means the greatest psychological thriller ever invented, but it has aroused my interest and, as always, Keitel performs well like a violent mad policeman. Too bad the rest of the film does not live up to its high standards
