... but I regret having seen it. Given that the rankings on IMDb are relatively high (and must also be relatively high on Netflix), I think I put it in the queue because it is advertised as a kind comedy by the UK, a category that has produced many films that I enjoyed immensely. "Saving Grace", on the other hand, falls into the category of comedies without laughter usually populated by Hollywood films produced and directed by people without talent. Brenda Blethyn is a capable actress and I liked her in other films. The concept - a gardener who cultivates marijuana to overcome the scarcity that he has to face after the death of her husband - does not offend me. Despite the strenuous efforts of the cast to produce humor, the film falls flat on his face (falling flat on his ass may have been more fun) regarding my wife and me. Be warned, oh kind reader, not all British comedies have succeeded. This is a real disaster.
