Basically, take the concept of every Asian horror movie and destroy it all in one and get this movie. The story is like this: a group of college kids receive voice messages from their phones that predict their death. There's a bit of a ghost, that if you've seen some Asian ghost movies, it's not scary. This film was quite shocking because it is very cliché. It's the same bullcrap, different film. <br /> <br /> The acting was pretty good. Unfortunately the actors are put in a situation very similar to a Ring, so it's nothing we haven't seen in the past. The two protagonists have done a good job. <br /> <br /> As for blood, there is not much to do. We get an interesting sequence that includes an arm that twists with its head down (I don't know how else to explain it), but it has been cut so as not to see anything except the final result. Sometimes you see blood, including decapitated arms and a zombie (which I could add very beautiful), but this film is not too bloody. <br /> <br /> Fears in the film are few and widespread and it's not really that scary. Sometimes you'll get scary pictures, but it's not enough for me to consider it scary. It's nothing different from Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and none of them are afraid of me. This is really the downfall of this (and most Asian horror movies) is that if it doesn't provide the fears then it's not that good. <br /> <br /> Regarding the direction, Takashi Miike did a good job anyway. He looked a little tame in this film compared to his previous films, but still portrays much of his messy style for which he became famous. Many images were very similar to Miike (including a scene with a group of dead fetus jars), and the last 15 - 20 minutes seemed much more Miike than the rest of the film. However, the film is defective due to its originality. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it only to people who are great in Asian horror movies (even if they are, I can recommend them much better) or to big Miike fans. Attention to those who want to join Miike, this is NOT his best job. <br /> <br /> I'm giving a 4 because it's just mediocre. Perhaps if it had been published 4 or 5 years ago, it could be worth a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I'd like b **** of very fast Asian horror movies. How come if it's an Asian horror movie, is it supposed to be good here (United States) automatically? Many of these films are the equivalent in Japan of what Scream, Urban Legends and I Know What Did Did Last Summer have been here in the 1990s. If you've seen one you've seen them all. And many of these films are based too much on fears and images that if they do not provide the fears they aim to do are not so good and nothing would change things. More Asian horror films have to be more like Audition and A Tale of Two Sisters, two films that if they don't scare you or scare you, at least have great stories, acting, directing, cinematography and much more to support them. Two films that are not just great horror films, but great films in general. More Asian horror films have to be like these instead of the cliché: "A ghost just wanted to be found, so he went around killing people through their phone / videotape / home / electric appliance / water pipes / search engine / vibrator / grocer / etc. "
