The American second-rate leader Guy Madison plays a character whose reputation precedes him in this Spaghetti Western ?? which, with very modest credentials, essentially emerges as a routine (although it has a fairly good score). The plot offers some slight interest: does the title, incidentally, refer to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gunmen on a ranch ?? the property of the family of their pursuer, the cavalry agent Madison. The younger brothers of the latter are determined by the fact that the injured party, now dependent on them, leads them to the head of the responsible gang; ultimately, the identity of both mysterious men shows a surprise ?? and both, ironically, get involved with one of Madison's sisters (another is raped during the raid). The Euro-Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears as insignificant as a saloon stewardess and the former Madison flame.
