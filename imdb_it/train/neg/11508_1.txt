Whatever Guy Ritchie has had to redo Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> This new film is a disaster. There was another person in the audience when I saw her, and she left us about an hour. (I hope he asked for a refund.) The only reason I spent until the end was because I never got out of a movie. <br /> <br /> But I sat through this piece of junk completely stunned that Madonna and Ritchie could really think they had made a good movie. The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is atrocious and the only good thing about this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's film and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a film that you wouldn't want to waste time looking at Cinemax late at night. Time is too precious to be wasted in crap like this.
