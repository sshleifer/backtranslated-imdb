Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories about the film. A mother and son move to a small town in Indiana with a secret. They are sleepwalkers, feline-type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of blood and special effects; more hints of incest. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is exceptional as a mother. Others that appear are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameo as keeper of the cemetery.
