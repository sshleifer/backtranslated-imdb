This film is a terrible waste of time. Even if it's only an hour and a half, it feels somewhere close to 4. I've never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. This is also a "horror" movie that takes place a lot during daylight. My friend and I laughed a crazy amount of times where we probably had to be afraid. <br /> <br /> The only thing we want to know is why such a terrible film has been released in so many countries. It cannot be so high in the application. <br /> <br /> Supermodel Nicole Petty should stick to modeling because, although beautiful, she has lost her accent many times in this movie, half the time she is British and half the time she is American.
