This movie was pretty bad. Science fiction is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original films that play there. I really don't know if this movie could be called original. Starting a zoo / theme park on a remote island seems quite familiar. What was it, oh yes, Jurassic Park. But this has the Sabertooth tigers instead. <br /> <br /> The film begins with some stereotypical university kids on an island who make a kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dying a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also, at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to create as many saber-toothed tigers as possible for people. 3 of them have already fled and are going around eating tourists, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers in person. Again, it looks like Jurassic Park. Probably the best thing was the 1000 pound saber tooth that climbed on its front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue that somehow narrows and crosses the boys' necks. The funniest death I've seen on TV. <br /> <br /> The acting is extremely poor, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost be called clay models, and even some sounds were turned off. For example, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to knock down a door, the ax enters the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad. The cheese deaths were quite fun though.
