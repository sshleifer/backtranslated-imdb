** HERE BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The government has continued to develop the UniversalSoldier program, now called UniSol. The soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before. However, the government is downsizing, the project is in danger and the supercomputer in the middle of all feels threatened, so it takes steps to ensure its safety. Activate and control UniSols and start chaos. The only one who can stop them is Deveraux (Van Damme). <br /> <br /> This film is about one thing. Choreographed fights. The story is ugly and soon drowns in all the struggles. Whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. Unfortunately for this movie, it's not fun to watch a fight where you know that part of it is indestructible. Normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to hear the fights between two fighters that are somehow the same. Not where one is indestructible and cannot lose. So the fights become just a tool to lengthen the time. You wait until the last fight when Deveraux miraculously finds a way to defeat his unbeatable enemies. To further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how poorly dressed women are. Well, there aren't many, because the characters are most of the men (there are at least one UniSol woman), but almost every woman is shown uselessly with at least one bra once. Women lead to getting by, but we also go through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. These moments give nothing to history and are there only to try to please the male audience of adolescent mentality. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, boring fights. No more nor less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
