Yes, this film has children going to the space camp and it starts pretty well, as the children meet and learn the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986 because they have nothing with that kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes friend with robot and robot repays the child's kindness by shooting him and a group of other children in this field in outer space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that don't have the signal to reach into space. Also this field is not very funny since these guys are subjected to a real workout and the instructors take them for failed missions or don't do the right things. Calm down, I'm there for fun, not to become astronauts yet, just give them the experience of space flight not a military field like that. However, we get to see Joaquin Phoenix in a role soon enough. So in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors one could even have the children fight the space aliens in addition to everything that was happening in the film as the film would have done is a little more pleasant for me at least. Probably even for a few others, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face torn by a strange super alien creature.
