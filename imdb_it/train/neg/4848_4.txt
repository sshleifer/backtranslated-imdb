I love a good war movie and fall into the "been there, done that" category. So I'd like to think that my review is accurate (IMHO). Having just watched this movie on DVD I can safely say it was a bunch of garbage. I can't recommend this movie at all. <br /> <br /> It started with me screaming on TV saying "you wouldn't do it" etc ... but I soon realized that having some work experience would be an obstacle so I got a bit cold. But on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell I had the bad feeling that this movie would be a real disaster ... I was right. <br /> <br /> There was simply no logic to the EOD scenes. I only know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents who were at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. So much so that I was left scratching my head all the time. Then, just when you think you know where the story is going, the Humvee kids walk around alone in the desert. One of the theater's most precious resources is to enter the scene in a group of aspiring SAS aspirants. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was really ridiculous. It didn't really make sense and made me want to shut down there and then. Then for them dragging him out for so long he really put my patience to the test. It started with the "Contact right" and we went down quickly. If you had a British accent, they shot you, but if you were part of the EOD team, suddenly you were a big hit and you saved the day. Then, just as you thought it was finished, it went on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story. Did you just leave to look and ask why it's not over yet? <br /> <br /> Then we had the alcoholic scene where they just hit each other for a laugh ... another scene where you just wanted it to end. He added nothing to the film. <br /> <br /> So, just as my life seemed very boring, the main star went off the line to hunt down someone. This is the most ridiculous scene I've ever seen. He challenged every logic and ability to write a good story ... it was meaningless and terrible. I still don't understand why they lost time. Then to watch him as he ran through the crowded streets back to the camp I rolled on the floor with laughter. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> The sad fact is that this plot is in the whole show without really deciding what it wants to be. I thought it would be stupid illogical EOD scenes, but then kept going on bribes trying to be something different. But as much as he tried, I was bored to death. All I wanted was for it to end. It was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed in a series of stupid, mindless scenes of action (ish). <br /> <br /> I can in no way recommend it. Perhaps my work experience has compromised the enjoyment, but even the naive must realize it just doesn't make sense. The only thing that is more stupid than this movie is the high nominal rating of IMDb ... which must be the 24 hour work of the box office PR team that seems to use this site as a way to make people believe all that is good. Sorry folks ... it's not! <br /> <br /> Not recommended ... it will bore you.
