It is hard to praise this film very much. The CGI for the dragon was well done, but a correct modeling of lights and shadows was missing. Furthermore, the same movie is used ad infinitum in the dragon that treads the corridors which becomes a bit boring. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see "Marco Aurelio" in the acting titles, wondering what a former emperor of the Roman Empire was doing in this film! As "Whoopie Goldberg" must be a pseudonym, and you can blame him for using it if it appears in this skunk. <br /> <br /> The story could be interesting, but the acting is flat, and the direction is boring. If you MUST watch this movie, go around your friends' house and get drunk while you do it - then it will be fun.
