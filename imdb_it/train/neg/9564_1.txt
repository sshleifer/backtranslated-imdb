Some people seem to think this is the worst movie they've ever seen, and I understand where they come from, but I've really seen worse. <br /> <br /> That said, the movies I can remember (ie the ones I didn't block) that were worse than that, were so bad that they physically suffered every sense that was involved in watching the movie. The films that are worse than War Games 2 are those that make you want to poke your eyes out, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep you from having another piece of your soul ripped out of you for horribleness. > <br /> War Games: The Dead Code is not so bad, but it is very close. Yes, I was a fan of the original, but I didn't expect miracles from this. Let's face it, the original wasn't much of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a love movie for 80s teenagers with a certain geeky charm. <br /> <br /> It's all I was hoping for, something bad, but that could have pulled my geek strings. Was it too much to ask? Isn't it really possible to do better than the original war games, even for a direct video version? Well it seems it was too much to ask. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just ugly, like "Oh yes, this is bad, but I like to enjoy it, maybe the end will be as good as it was in the original." And then it gets worse and worse, and in the end, believe me, you wish you hadn't seen this movie.
