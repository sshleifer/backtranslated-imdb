This is probably one of the worst French films I've seen so far, from over 100 French films I've ever seen. The terrible script and the very mediocre / unprofessional acting make the director impotent. with everything that matters no matter how beautiful the French French scene and fantasy music can add to the story. <br /> <br /> One of the weaknesses of this film is that these two characters DO NOT attract people, as a public I don't care what happens to them. <br /> <br /> I was amazed how this film won the jury prize at cannes, man, I love almost all the cannes-winning films, but not this one. A big disappointment for me.
