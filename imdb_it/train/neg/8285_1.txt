This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only has no acting skills, but the script is incredibly superficial and lame. In reality you hear a serious dialogue that says "I love you more". "I do not love you anymore." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. His "southern-girl charm" doesn't work and is actually quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she offers the lines as she is reading the script to the right of the page. <br /> <br /> Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do it, or did he fall in love with dad Joe (Jessica's father and also the film's producer) promises big profits? I hope you know better now to access another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see his suffering gaze while suffering through bad dialogue. <br /> <br /> Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably both involved in the film somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the film a better rating. No one in their right mind could actually find this engaging movie. <br /> <br /> Jessica has a lot of money, right? Maybe you buy some acting lessons?
