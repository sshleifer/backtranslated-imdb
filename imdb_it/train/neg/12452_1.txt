This movie is so bad I can't even begin to describe it. What's in the glowing pit of writers, producers and directors? How the hell did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is ridiculous, the acting is at best poor, the story ... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating until you want to turn it off. I think I'm the biggest loser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I saw this movie just because Scott Adkins was there ... and it's in it ... for 30 seconds. .. <br /> <br /> I give him 1 out of 10 because it is the lowest rating that IMDb has to offer. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor: watch a Uwe Boll movie instead ... twice ... it's more worthy of your time.
