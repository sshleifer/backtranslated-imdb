UPA movies are surprisingly well reviewed on IMDb despite the fact that the quality of the animation is light years away from that of Looney Toons, Disney and MGM at their peak. Unfortunately, due to the increase in costs in creating beautiful cartoons with high frame-rates and enchanting backgrounds, the UPA style (which debuted around 1950) began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s. After all, the films were inexpensive and had received several Oscars to "prove" that the cartoons were now mainstream. As a result, crappy animation was becoming the norm and this trend was not canceled until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA film is one of the first. The characters are drawn in a very simple way (simpler and would have used stylized figures) and the backgrounds were ugly: simple drawings with colors added very quickly (often with a sponge and rarely filled objects completely). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it's a jive story with a strong jazz style. Some will love it, others will find it very, very strong. It's the traditional story of "Frankie and Johnny" and, due to the shootings and everything, it's probably not a great movie for children. Heck, because of the animation and the jazz, even for me it's a particularly beautiful film! Some will read my review and I no doubt think I'm an eccentric (which I am, to some extent). However, I love animated films and some of this minimalist UPA style goes far, far away and you can't seriously consider them great works of art - just very, very fast cartoons. Ignore the Oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something - anything else!
