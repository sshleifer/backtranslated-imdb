Although I have to admit that I laughed more watching this film than the last comedies I've seen. <br /> <br /> The budget was to consist of a change of pocket from the actors. The production values ​​are so low that they are really fun to watch. It reminds me of the Monster Robot composed by a boy in a gorilla jacket with a cardboard diving helmet. <br /> <br /> In a scene an unfortunate victim cuts his arm and leg. Damn, hard to believe, but the scene of the Holy Grail black knight was more realistic. I kept wondering why the victim didn't start shouting "No one passes" and "It's just a wound, I got worse." It was one of the funniest scenes I've seen last year. <br /> <br /> Even the "gladiator / demon" was a point. Between the horribly cheap costume and the geeky aspect of the boy, the end result was hysterical. Actually a movie that is bad enough to be watchable. A bit like seeing a car crash in slow motion on the film. <br /> <br />
