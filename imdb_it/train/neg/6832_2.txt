I would have enjoyed this movie, but Van Damme always does the same old garbage every time. The panties of poop fight the scenes as usual. The only thing this loser left out was that the Russians normally end up being killed in the end. This film is a must-do of the highest nature, please, please, please Van Damme receive some acting lessons, you need it. Anyone who loves Van Damme has problems, it seems sad that the only way Van Damme gets any acting job is when he writes the film, co produces the film and makes the screen for the film. AVOID VAN DAMME AND ITS LOWER PART OF THE NASTY WIG. I give this film a two out of ten, because the one with the sandman was better. To add insult to injury I wasted a quid on this manure
