Others have already commented on the "decline" of director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was perfectly capable of selecting good projects (as he demonstrated in the same year "Exorcist III"), so why did he agree to appear in this? Of course, it gives a demented performance, and the film is not entirely negative; it's just not engaging, uninteresting and unattractive. There are three too many "un-". (* 1/2)
