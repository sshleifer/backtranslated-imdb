This film is a disgusting and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle. Performances are generally crappy especially from Capshaw, Fishburne and the usual solid Ed Harris. Connery looks uncomfortable like a Harvard academic. The film absolutely gets worse as it proceeds. It is a third-level mystery that becomes extremely elaborate from the moment it is undone. The film wastes an excellent supporting cast. George Plimpton also plays a minor role to add some gravity to Connery as they discuss the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere focus on a third mystery / thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree. Scripting and direction are extremely poor. Connery's charisma and stage presence are the only virtue of the film. Manipulative, violent and ridiculous. 2/10 Avoid it.
