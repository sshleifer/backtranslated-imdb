Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately the direction is not his forte. I had high expectations for the film before I rented it and maybe that's why I didn't like it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt to make a film that takes place mainly in a small environment, but it is not the attempt that counts. I found the film boring, boring and stretched. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is aware of most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (it amused me how young and plump the Scream star was). The only thing that struck me about this film was the only revival of the car crash from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved along the line and beyond the wreck. However, that shot was very "Usual Suspects" and my guess is that Spacey got the idea from that previous movie of his (which is very good for you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in a small environment, look at Hitchcock's lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before shooting this.
