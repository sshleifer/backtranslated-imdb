Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, his role required no. He didn't say much and looked pale throughout the film. The character of Luise was a slave then given in marriage to the character of Paul Muni (he did a fantastic job for his interpretation). Set in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asians, but they were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that's why Luise must have won her Oscar. She must have been a revolutionary actress, one of the first to do the method. This looks like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino played an Italian and a Cuban. I felt that Luise's performance was off all the time, and when she died, she didn't change expression in any of the previous scenes. It remained the same throughout the film; she changed her expression or emotion only twice. If his brilliant acting was so subtle, I suppose I didn't see it.
