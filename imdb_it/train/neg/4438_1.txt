I borrowed this film from the library, I think it could be delicious. How wrong I am! <br /> <br /> It's such a bad movie that I have to write something about it. Mira Sorvino is SO bad in the film, it is very painful to see the scene with her. She is a pretty girl, but in this film, she is not at all seductive, but I will have to watch her clumsy attempt to seduce almost all the other main characters. It's so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> And the dialogue of the film is so pretentious and devoid of the humorous fact that it then becomes acceptable. <br /> <br /> Completely failed.
