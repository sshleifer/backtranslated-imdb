Like so many media experiments, this amateur effort contains the seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the more than 5 years since its publication, the premise has been made less scandalous by real world events in software development, and for this reason I found it less boring than the previous commentator, I imagine ... The director is clearly a fan of Hitchcock and it is a pity that the film was not performed better, but in reality it is almost a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack that screams when we should pay attention. You can almost see exclamation marks and capital letters on a yellowing page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it rather amusing for all these reasons and more. Sometimes slick has less to offer and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and even though the seams showed and creaked a lot, my heart rate went up and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
