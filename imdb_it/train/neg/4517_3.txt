There is much to appreciate here: spectacular places and flight sequences; period costumes, props and scenographies; and competent writing and acting. However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal to show some qualities we can appreciate or admire. In this group of needy snobs, did we find only one character who is completely likable ?? a hapless enlisted in a fleeting peripheral role as a helpless victim. From the reviews given here, it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we have not found their behavior as a funny or fun mischievous student. Even the dog is detestable. We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discard these remarks accordingly, but what I could find written about this miniseries gave us no reason to expect a transformation or redemption of the character.
