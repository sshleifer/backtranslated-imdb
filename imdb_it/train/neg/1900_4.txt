Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired car thief who is forced to return to the "game" when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The work plans to "lift" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will carry out his punishment. So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets up the task. But the police are up to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It would seem an almost impossible job to complete. <br /> <br /> He has a pretty interesting cast: Gone In 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone deserves better. Enough acting power there to push a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that this is a case of too many cars that do excess parking, lots of characters, not enough enthusiasm. From now on we have no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, a shit script made of loud noises and cheese whipping, shooter editing, and mace directed subtly by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a large budget remake of H.B. Halicki's independent 1974 film of the same name, with the premise that it offers the potential for a movie based on the adrenaline-fueled car. Potential that unfortunately never occurs. There are one or two high-impact moments, certainly stupid, but still fun. But if you pardon the pun, the film never comes out of first gear, it's happier to work with its stack of characters who care about trying to make the crude script work {Scott Rosenberg}. <br /> <br /> Car fans will have something to do {machines are ace in the eye}, as well as fans of unintentional comedy films {take a look at the time of the Ecclestone carpenter}. But no, it's really quite poor after all. 4/10
