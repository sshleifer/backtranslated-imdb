... And I never thought that a film deserved to be rewarded with a 1! But this is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the plot from the DVD box seemed pretty predictable. It is not a mystery, nor a film for capturing young people. It does not include any sensuality, if that is what the title might suggest some of you at a distance. This is just a total no. Don't waste your time and money unless you want to see a group of young people in a grown-up Gothic environment, where a murderer pursues them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth looking at. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Stahl.
