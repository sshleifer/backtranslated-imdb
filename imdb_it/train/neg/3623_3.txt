(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was a drive-in function, co-invoiced with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. An Italian-Spanish co-production in which a series of women in a village is murdered in the same period in which a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback, riding with his dog 'man-eating' behind him. <br /> <br /> Citizens already suspect that he is responsible for this and want his castle to be burned. The murders began before the time when Count Igor Dalmar, elder brother of Count Yanos, was horribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) whom Igor had hired before his death to help him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of his brother and together they look for formulas for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to revive Igor's charred body. <br /> <br /> But of course Igor is still alive (though horribly burned) and he chases and kills the women in the village. We see his burning face in flesh and blood appear at various points in the film, so we know he is still alive, making the whole thing a little too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets another fiery end when a quarrel with Yanos on Ivanna enters the scene, with lit candles falling on the same bed where Igor stumbles, encountering yet another final charred final. <br /> <br /> The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks rather gritty and bad. In addition to an even more scratchier trailer, no other extras are included. Although it has a beautiful creepy Spanish castle and a good atmosphere, I found it quite boring and predictable, without excitement or mystery, anything. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
