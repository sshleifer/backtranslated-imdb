This series had potential, but I suppose the budget wouldn't allow him to see that potential. An interesting configuration, not unlike "lost", falls flat after the 1st episode. The entire series, 6 episodes, could have made a compelling 90-minute film, but the producers chose to drag it back and forth. Many scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and did not work overall. There were a few characters we cared about while their characters didn't grow during the time period --- well, one grew a little. The ending was as terrible as the rest of the series. The only compliments here are for art and set dressers, they have created an interesting aspect, a pity that the writer and the director lacked the foresight to do something interesting with that element
