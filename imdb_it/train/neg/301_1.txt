This is the worst documentary ever released from Canada !!!! I'm glad to see that the boys haven't made another film. All they want to do is get a movie and it doesn't have to be what they wrote. They continue to change the script to give a suite to the person they are proposing. I couldn't get out of the theater fast enough when I saw him at the Toronto Film Festival that year. Please never see this movie.
