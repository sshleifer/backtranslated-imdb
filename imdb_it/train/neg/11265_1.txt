There were some low moments in my life when I was baffled and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminum was one of them. <br /> <br /> The warning signs were there. None before (even the stars didn't want to participate) and no review in the magazines. The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I could recover some sleep. <br /> <br /> Nothing was explained in the film. The narrative was idiotic. At one point I cheered up when the main role of the film seemed to have been shot, then to my growing desperation, it was revealed that he hadn't really been hit so as to dampen my joy. I sincerely hope that all the people involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, mainly moments of involuntary humor. For example, the scene where the main character, for some unknown reason, feels the need to lighten himself manually in a toilet, while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears. <br /> <br /> My words cannot explain the anger I feel, so I will end this way. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: for sadists, wastrels and only regressives who want to torture themselves.
