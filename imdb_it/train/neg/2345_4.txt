I saw Written on the Wind with Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone - Robert Stack was terrible - just awful - he should have been a fascinating jet-set millionaire - instead he turned out like a jerk by the word go it was stupid and exaggerated and the 3 "romantic" tracks had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, even though her tramp character was boring - she thinks Splendor's older sister in The Grass was full of malice, bitterness and charisma. Director Douglas Sirk ensured that the entire cast made its way through a dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. He had a cameo of the actor who played the main role in Get Smart
