Style but no substance. It's not as fun as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of cinema. A young filmmaker is hired to finish a science fiction film set in the 1960s called Codename: Dragonfly. Think of Barbarella, or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a distressed director. He is not a hacker, he is an artist. The film he wants to make is a diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside the director of Jeremy Davies are as thin as rice paper. The characters that could be interesting, like his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack director, are presented and then showed the door without adding a thing. <br /> <br /> This film is full of eye candy but when compared to other films about directors like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it paled in comparison. Those movies are fun, provocative with well-developed characters. Those movies have lessons that apply outside <br /> <br /> The film wants to be comical and campy but it's just derivative and there's no fun scene. The filmmakers describe it as a transmission but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it is a tribute but I think I would prefer a full version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the setting, as is evident from the visual mood of the sci-fi movie in a film. But he can't explain why we should have fun. <br /> <br /> Outside the sci-fi movie, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the director chooses a sci-fi weapon after it has already been chosen. Thing? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene in which the filmmaker confronts critics who complain about the lack of stories, the lack of points, a scene where he admits an empty intelligence does not mean that he is turned those criticisms. <br /> <br /> I imagine that if your Roman Coppola can get away with making a film about an anguished idealist filmmaker who doesn't know what she wants to say and ends up saying nothing. In this sense it could be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would watch it on Circuit City on a wall full of TVs if I had a choice. Watch 15 minute coded movies: Dragonfly included on the DVD as an extra and then send it back.
