I saw 10 in the afternoon showing and I have to say that this film was nothing special. Even if I didn't leave the theater wanting time back (since I don't actually pay for the films anymore) I didn't find any quality of redemption. <br /> <br /> There were a few lines and things that made me giggle, but mostly the movie seemed to consist of a rampant fan service for the younger ones (in mind more than age like this movie is rated R ) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather scattered. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of hype for very little profit. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG, which looked very digitized and didn't fit well with the live action on the screen. <br /> <br /> Now I am a reasonable man, I knew I was going to the theater that I would not see "Casablanka", and I am at least grateful that this film is an original idea (albiet inane) and not a sort of re make or franchise spin off. However, to be honest, if you are not part of the following cult you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the movie in a second-run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.
