I cannot for the life of me explain what the popularity of the children's television series is, the power rangers are everything. <br /> <br /> I never understood why unsuspecting children enjoyed this show in the first place, since the characters seem so idiotic and not worth taking care of. <br /> <br /> The costumes seem completely atrocious, like the multicolored spandex that people wear to go to the gym. <br /> <br /> What exactly is the purpose of this showing however, but for children to learn how to fight to solve their problems? What's up with the horrible haircuts and clothing in this show anyway? Not to mention this show that is still playing on cable television, just to make money to teach children how to fight each other when they don't agree on a certain problem. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more fun for today's kids, hopefully I'm not as gullible as the 90s kids who watched this show. <br /> <br /> Oh, and what happens with the homo-erotic tension between the red and green rangers anyway?
