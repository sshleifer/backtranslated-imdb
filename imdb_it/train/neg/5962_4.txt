Paul Naschy has made a large number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to vary from fairly good waste to unwatchable; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a sorcerer, a wizard or (as in the case here) sorcerer, who is put to death - but not before having sworn revenge on those who did ... Etc. So we get a s√©ance one thing leads to another and very soon the executed wizard is no longer successful. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film feels constantly useless. The characters contain reams of diatribes and never serve the film in any way. Paul Naschy wrote the script and, if you ask me, he should stick to acting because dialogue is trivial to the extreme, and serves only to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil, offers a boring direction, whose dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes shit films like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb doesn't even have that. This is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing to do with interest.
