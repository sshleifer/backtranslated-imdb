Not too keen on this really. The story is rather horrible and unconvincing. I liked the first 10 minutes, good Bill Nunns. After that it was pretty scary. Tim doesn't fit the role, he runs into a smug and swollen ass and Pruitt Taylor wins is not at all convincing as a trumpeter. He is an idealistic film and as a musician, he feels slightly offended after seeing him. There are no scenes from the 1900s that practice or play with his bandmates, he is completely self-indulgent. I find it difficult to establish a relationship with this type of character, maybe I'm watching the wrong movie. If you don't have a real passion for life or a sense of what the music of all then happily indulge in disbelief and watch this waffle.
