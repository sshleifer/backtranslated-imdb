The original is a relaxing watch, with some truly memorable animation sequences. Unfortunately, the sequel, although not the worst of the DTV sequels, completely misses the spark. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment is the lack of a story. Like Belle's Magical World, the characters are told through a series of cartoons. Magical World, although marginally better, still manages to make a mess of history. Among the cartoons, we see mice at work, and I personally think that the antics of Jaq and Gus are the merits they redeem for this film. <br /> <br /> The first cartoon is the best, on Cinderella who gets used to being a princess. This is the best, because the mice were the most fun here. The worst of the cartoons, when Jaq turns into a human, is sometimes cute, but has a lack of imagination. Even the last vignette, when Anastasia fell in love, was pretty. The problem was that I could not imagine that Anastasia was friendly with Cinderella, since I considered her the worst of the stepsisters. This was also marked by a rather ridiculous subplot on Lucifer who falls in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> The incidental music was very pleasant to listen to, however I hated the songs, they were really uninspired, and nothing like the beautiful melodies inspired by Tchaikovsky's original. <br /> <br /> The characters have been the strongest development here. Cinderella, though still considerate, had lost her sincerity and much of her charm from the original, although she wore pretty clothes. The Duke had some really fun moments but it wasn't enough to save the film, in the same way with Prudence and the king. As I said earlier, the mice were the film's merits of salvation, given that only they contributed to the film's beauty. I also have to say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the dubbing was surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice sequel, even if not original, that was ruined by the songs and the lack of a story. 4/10 for mice, reciting voice, animation and some nice clothes.
