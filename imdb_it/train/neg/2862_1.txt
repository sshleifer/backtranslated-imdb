Someone has to send this Uli Lommel back to MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? Can only ANY make movies these days? In the past, it always required TALENT before anyone could make a film. After seeing this movie Zoppo BTK and the others he has made, it seems clear that the poor boy has more business films than I do. Actually I think even I could make better films than Uli LAME-ALL. This film has absolutely nothing to do with the BTK Killer, apart from the names of the victims and the killer. THAT'S ALL. Where does this guy come from has the great idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other crappy crap in the movie? This is a classic example of someone trying to attract people to watch their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful The only serial killer movie I consider WORSE is that lame "DAHMER" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes that it made me sick. Anyone who created that must be killed.
