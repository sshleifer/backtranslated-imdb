A memorable phrase from a short-lived show. After seeing the episode in which this line was introduced, my intramural flag football team started using the line to break our attacking clashes. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarterback said that FOOTBALL and the rest of the team answered BET! A fun way to break the conversation that made our opponents scratch their heads as very few of them had seen the show. The use of this line has added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season during my university year that year and, in a sense, it was the fun we used with this line. The show was pretty much a stinker, but lives in the memories of the 1977 Pi Kappa Phi intramural flag football team from West Virginia Tech.
