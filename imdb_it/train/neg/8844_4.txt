I saw this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even convincing my wife that it was a "unique horror movie". I wanted to love this movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was pretty bad. If the story only spoke of a young man in love with a girl who suffered from parasomnia, then it would have been a better film. <br /> <br /> The treatment center has stretched the credulity beyond the limits, in fact it was quite ridiculous. The doctor happily ignores the laws on privacy and professionalism. A nurse enters a room for the routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without a safety escort), and drops the tray and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason. Is the forensic patient (and the villain of the film) tied up in a fully dressed upright position - apparently for years? None of this makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The film also had some actors that I liked in other things, like detectives, but I still can't recommend this movie.
