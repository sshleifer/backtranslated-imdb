Truly a disgusting and vile film, with only a small amount of true humor. <br /> <br /> The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme (intentionally so, of course), and portrayed in the most pathetic, sorry way. <br /> <br /> My wife and I found this film horribly upsetting, with absolutely no saving features. Frankly, I wish I'd never seen it. <br /> <br /> I consider this British effort a sick and gross embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Those who have enjoyed this film have a skill that I totally lack: that of rejoicing in an exhibition of profound debauchery and squalor. <br /> <br /> Producers should be ashamed of themselves.
