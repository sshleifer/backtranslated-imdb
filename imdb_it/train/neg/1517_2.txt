In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. below I will elaborate and tell you why, in my humble opinion, it ruins this film. <br /> <br /> Gere and Danes are doing their job, and although it's not their best job, it's quite OK. The rest of the cast, however, is doing a really poor job. Mind you, this is not completely the fault of the actors. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones with characters that have the slightest part in the film to really give depth. All the other characters have too much space in the film to create depth, or the character is such a cliché that no matter how hard the actors feel. <br /> <br /> The director has some complex self, but just looking at the direction, I think he does a good job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all it's a bad movie. The characters are superficial (except the characters of Gere and Danes), the bad guys are clichés and the characters' actions are absolutely incredible. In addition to this, writers must have an agenda in which they want to report our views and the ethics of a hundred years. It is the kind of film that is saying that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of whether they paid the price the company gave them. It is also the type of film that says, even if only between the lines, that any form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And, of course, according to the film, everything that is not sex in the position of a married couple as a missionary is a sexual deviance. <br /> <br /> So if you're going to film the school and you need an example of a bad script, or if you're writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost. Watch it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
