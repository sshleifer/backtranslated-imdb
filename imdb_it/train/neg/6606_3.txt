Please don't hate me, but I have to be honest, watching this movie, I had a great time. <br /> <br /> It's a film with a stupid cast and silly songs !!! <br /> <br /> Useless songs !!! Mehbooba ... A total insult to the original Uno Holi .... well .. it was OK! because of the tradition that every film had to have one !! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever ... A stupid song by UNNEEDED jee Le ... It looked like a stupid Playboy song song ... <br /> <br /> Beyond the songs. The film was OK. This was the adaptation of Ram Gopal Verma ... If you think you will like this movie <br /> <br /> Well, this movie depends only on the Viewer and his judgment if he thinks this is the movie Total Copy He / She would like to hit the head on the cinema seat Or if he / she thinks of his / her own directorial look he / she would be relaxed and take a look at this movie <br /> <br /> Anyways I looked in both ways I would have congratulated and abused Ram Gopal for this disaster he did ... <br /> <br /> Well some other things that bothered the fact that the cast was incredibly bad <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan As Babban / Gabbar (Amitabh in his movie Remake Funny what was Director Thinking) Ajay Devgan As Heero / Veeru (Bobby Deol could have been better) Prashant Raj As Raj / Jai (Abhishek was meant for this role despite doing a Special Apparition in Mehbooba song) Sushmita Sen As Radha / Durga (Jaya Bachchan e right ra Tabu was right for this role) Nisha Kothari As Ghungroo / Basanti (I think Es ha Deol would have been Great) Mohanlal As Narishma / Thakur (Mohanlal is so cute .... Oops Sorry hehehehe, It was OK I couldn't think of nobody) <br /> <br /> The film would also have a FAIRED If the Cast was OK <br /> <br /> The films weren't even exciting, the film was OK, Just to watch <br /> < br /> The general assessment <br /> <br /> Direction ... 8/10 I Got some credit credits ... 9/10 Script ... 3/10 BAD Scripting Songs ... 5/10 Useless in the film, it could have been better, Easy on the Ears on to be played in PC and IPod and Stuff Cast ... 1/10 <br /> <br /> Total ... 3/10 <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
