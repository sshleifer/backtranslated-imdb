Gday companions! I just watched the movie Croc Hunter. it was fine but the show seems more real. this seemed to me a longer episode of AnimalPlanet with more fun lines and more characters. Some things: Steve described the fangs as hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for the real you know it hurts. and can't jump high? everyone grabs them by the tail and stuff. There were two split Shift shots in this film. when Terry finds that little boy, she says "We have to feed them, just like a child". Woah! I thought she would go out and breastfeed that baby. this however made it PG-13. While on Terry, someone noticed on the film and most of the show that Terry knows about ritual mating. she knows her sex things. the film takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, a dingo and a joey! <br /> <br /> Steve Sui's dog actually has a purpose in this film. even if a child is useless against the bomb that wields dynamite. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if someone looks at it, try and I agree with you that the country's fat bumpkin lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in target shooting the croc. he was eating his sheep !! I would be crazy too!
