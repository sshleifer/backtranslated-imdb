I really wanted to like this movie, but I ended up bored and incredulous. The first shot is a camera powered by a robot that travels to a bomb and is, of course, shaky. But then the rest of the film remains in shakycam mode, even during silent moments of conversation, to the point of being ridiculous. Are rented houses running out of tripods and Steadicam? The fact that it was shot at 16 mm does not help, since the whole film is grainy and flickering. <br /> <br /> For all the efforts made by Bigelow in vehicles and precise equipment, there are quite obvious errors and inconsistencies that undermine the credibility of the film. <br /> <br /> - A car would not explode in flames after a single blow, and once swallowed it would not be extinguished by a small hand-held fire extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not have driven around Baghdad in 2004, but would have been supported by other vehicles in the event of a breakdown or attack. - It would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit an insurgent running long range, where the bullet is clearly taking more than a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I believe the bombs were taken to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not a random spot in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> - The attack on the tanker is said to have occurred in the Green Zone, a highly secure area that has suffered very few attacks from within. The area is mostly offices and buildings with few residences, yet it is represented as a dangerous labyrinth of dark alleys and ambushes. Oddly enough, James never gets himself in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering all his two companions to take an alley by themselves, thus preparing the kidnapping attempt. <br /> <br /> - By the way, the 3-man team is always depicted erasing buildings, chasing insurgents, etc. alone, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to fix a dead insurgent hanging outside a window to understand that he is not faking it? <br /> <br /> No strokes were established to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was related. I had no idea who the EOD team was referred to, nor were any other characters made. These are things that the characters should know, so we should do it too. <br /> <br /> Many of the "surprises" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatric colonel will be in trouble with the Iraqis who are trying to move forward, that the choice of cereals at home will be overwhelming and that a driver you kidnapped won't wait for you when you leave the vehicle. <br /> <br /> Finally, there has been an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, he is reckless and addicted to adrenaline. It's exactly the same at the end of the film. What's the point? <br /> <br /> If this is indeed the best so far of Iraqi war films, it is a sorry group. Based on the half hour I saw, I would recommend Generation Kill on HBO.
