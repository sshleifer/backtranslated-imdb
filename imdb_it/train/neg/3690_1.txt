Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused his downfall. He was released with much fanfare, but crashed badly and caused serious financial losses for his producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to repay them personally for the losses suffered. Shortly after his release, he tried to venture into politics, but failed miserably. It's a very bad film with horrible acting, bad quality makeup and a pathetic script. During the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I am one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba on the first day of the first theatrical performance. The audience was so bored that many of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I don't recommend it to anyone.
