this show is horrible. no comedy, no plot no good characters. America is blind giving the prize to real shows. i hate this show along with 30 rock. honestly I'm so glad they canceled this show. thanks CBS. keep two and a half men, continues Christine, keep the rules of engagement and keep on knowing your mother, who is actually not funny but much more fun than that. this show is a rip-off of friends. so with the same director, that's fine. but keep this show gone and never bring it back. never ever the only reason I didn't give it a rating is because it keeps my awakening instead of sleeping. those are the types of movies or TV shows that I give one. the only reason I was still awake was because of the audience's laughter and I couldn't wait to see the next show. I really wish this show was fun, but my opinion is stupid. very stupid. I don't see why everyone loves my opinion again. but I also find the big bang theory stupid. my bad villain the class bye bye now I have a smile and it is not to watch your show.
