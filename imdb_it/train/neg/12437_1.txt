'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone movies to not include Culkin in the lead role and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original movie "Home Alone". Instead of two bad comedians, we take three or four. This film involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote controlled car. Even the slapstick humor is consistent, but the boy and the villains really can't make an impact in this film. (It is not a pun). This film offers nothing new or different from the previous films, and there is not really the warm feeling or subplots that the other two films have had. It's more of a pure comedy, but he couldn't make me laugh because the characters didn't do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; It's pretty boring. If you're looking for a good family comedy movie, watch the original movie "Home Alone".
