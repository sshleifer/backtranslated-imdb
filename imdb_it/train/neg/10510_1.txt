oh god where to start ...... bad acting .... characters you don't care about ... they are American or English ... they seem to think they are in America, because where else is this a huge forest in midlands ... <br /> <br /> a major flaw ... they are driving all night through these woods ... unless they are out and about in Scotland they came in the morning .. when the whining knocks to the poor woman wandering over .... <br /> <br /> and they are mobile they do not work .. so what they do ... they naturally split, they make it easier to take ... so three go in search of a house that could be there in the middle of nowhere and two behind to "take care" of the unconscious woman ... so what they do, rather than make her feel comfortable, attack her head, cover her or even move her from the street that bloom leave lying on the hard road while going to make a fire 100 years apart .... and all the time c who have a camper could put it in ... <br /> <br /> and on the horned angels that should have wanted mankind so much to be expelled from the sky to live among us ... so what do they do? undertake sexual relations with all the men they meet? ......... no they bite huge pieces from them and tear their heads off ... I think the point is missing ... <br /> <These are not beautiful sexually deprived former angels they are cannabal vampires ... and as for Tom Savini who says they are incredibly beautiful ... they are the girls who have beautiful bodies but nothing special in the face. the main role was much nicer than these so-called irresistible sirens ... <br /> <br /> waste of rubbish films of Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
