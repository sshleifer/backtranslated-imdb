"Fly Me To The Moon" must be the worst animated film I've seen in a LONG TIME. He's been saying something since I took my son to see every animated version in the last 4 years. The story must be generous ... trivial. The dubbing is atrocious, too cute. Humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a type of Nickolodeon cartoon, but this was released on the big screen and not on cable television. <br /> <br /> Get a 2 only for its 3D graphics. Some scenes have a slightly stimulating image, but in the past we have seen much better. I also question the directors' insistence on having characters fly off the screen rather than on it in most scenes. While this is interesting at first it became tiring after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to me to be indifferent by the creators. <br /> <br /> I'll say it anyway, it had a very nice soundtrack. And for the record, my son wasn't too crazy. Bad movie
