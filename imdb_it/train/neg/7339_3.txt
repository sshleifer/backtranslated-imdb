Maya is a woman without interests. He only dreams of his life and wonders, why he doesn't feel satisfied. This could be an interesting topic. He would need a good story, a pleasant environment and good dialogues. It has none of these. This film is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climaxes. The only highlight is Shahrukh Khan. But although I'm a big fan of him, I can't stand this movie. He too can't make this movie exciting. The film is not as bad as "King Uncle" and if you are an Art-house fan or you like slow, maybe you will like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it doesn't capture. My recommendation: don't watch it
