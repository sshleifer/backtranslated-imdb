The plot of this film is very interesting and, in general, the plot is not so bad ... but the details: writing, directing, continuity, rhythm, action sequences, acrobatics and use of CG are all cheap and ruin the film. <br /> <br /> First of all, action sequences. They are all pretty exciting. Most consist of someone who stands up and gets shot, without trying to escape, fight, dodge or anything, even if they have all the time in the world. The sequences seem insignificant for something done in 2004. <br /> <br /> The CG has very nice rendering and animation effects, but they prove inexpensive due to the way they are used. <br /> <br /> Stimulation: everything happens too fast. For example, "Elle" is trained to fight in a couple of hours, and from the beginning can do back-flip, etc. Why is it so acrobatic? None of this is explained in the film. Like Lilith, she wouldn't have needed to be able to do somersaults - maybe she couldn't, since she had wings. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we have sequences like a woman being hit by a car, and getting up and going into a deserted room with a sink and a mirror, and then stabbing herself in the throat, for no apparent reason, and without any of the spectators really worried that she was hit by a car (and then you hear the side effects of another exploding machine) ... "Are you okay?" he asks the driver "yes, I'm fine" he says, bloodied and unkempt. <br /> <br /> I saw everything, though, because the introduction promised me it would be interesting ... but in the end, the poor execution made me want anything else: Blade, Vampire Hunter D, too that vampire movie in which Jackie Chan was a comic relief, because they managed to suspend disbelief, but that made me want to shake the awake director, and give the writer a good conversation.
