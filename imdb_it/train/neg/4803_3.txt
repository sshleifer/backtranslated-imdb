Adrianne, she really should have a life, without Mr. "Brady". You make me sick and it was one of the main reasons why I know you can tune in to the show longer. It is a rather brainless show, and every little discussion or disagreement seems to be put under the spotlight and analyzed until death. This makes it seem / seem anything but ready for marriage, yet I know that these disagreements are part of life. I think this is entertainment for some people. If this happens to fall in the next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with his life, but look at this garbage. Even if I'm not terribly surprised. I can't stand the ads in this show anymore! I hope they get enough money to embarrass themselves on camera week after week. However, girl "A" has a great ass!
