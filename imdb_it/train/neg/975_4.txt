I saw "Woman On The Beach" by this director and I couldn't understand the positive or positive reviews. This film is very similar to that, two people who are trapped in a relationship with little dynamic and even less interest in anyone else. Like his other films, you must want to listen to a blank dialogue, wade very little and be enchanted by characters written in an uninteresting way. If you think you can love this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I think Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior. He has a rather exceptional actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I would like IU, but I don't. Oh good.
