This is the most disturbing film I've ever seen. Makes "Disney's Requiem for a Dream". Although, technically, it is reasonably well done, acting, cinematography, music, directing, etc., are good. However, the final group rape scene is the most terrifying and violent thing I've ever seen and I really wish I hadn't seen it. I'm afraid it will haunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think that anyone can find the film extremely disturbing, my wife and some of her friends were victimized in a very similar way and I didn't really need an explicit reference to the horror they experienced. I saw the movie at the SXSW film festival in Austin, TX and none of the cast or crew members were present. I would have liked for them to have had the opportunity to defend the violence in their film, which I felt was excessive, free and useless. An earlier scene successfully conveyed the mood they apparently aspired to, but without rubbing their faces in extreme and explicit sexual violence. This film should have a large WARNING label on it. For these reasons I would not recommend anyone to see it. You have been warned
