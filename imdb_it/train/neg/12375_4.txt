The beauty of this is at least fresh: almost no film about dance music and the club scene (if ever made) hit cinemas. It also radiates a lot of energy, from music to the representation of Ibiza. <br /> <br /> But the main problem is that he can't decide what he wants to be. Although I definitely like being a mockumentary on the line of This is Spinal Tap, the producers also realized that they didn't want to play a script. However, it grossly fails in the lines because it is not written very well and most of the characters are underdeveloped. And he has no arc in his script and directs it to get to 90 minutes, so why not change it to 75? The production department and the cinema are still trying to save the day (eg Paul's house). <br /> <br /> In a strange and unexpected way this way it's all over Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the Almost Famous line. Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer a bit of acting. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: it's a mess, somehow entertains at a basic level, but it's better to spend a night in your favorite club.
