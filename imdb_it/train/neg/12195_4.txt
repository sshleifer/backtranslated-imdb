The plot is not so original. If anyone saw "The Last Kiss" there is nothing new. A wealthy family in Rome who lives everyday life is boring and false, with everyone asking others what they think of them. Really boring after half an hour because it's easy to understand where the story will end. This is because it is easy to see the moralistic vision of Muccino in this film, so even the most difficult parts seem normal. To summarize in the first 2 minutes of the film would be sufficient and the purpose of the film has already been said. the family has seen for 30 years, I don't like to see films that want to show reality but to be consistent with his thoughts he must push beyond normal situations. Really good as Muccino puts the camera in the right place that moves with carrie and is the only reason that leads me to not sleep in the cinema even if always in the film I scream from the beginning. Maybe it could be nice to see the family as they are in reality and not blame something outside. Morante was intense and big as usual but unfortunately in a bad movie!
