There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American film experience. <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion, but a good thriller depends on creating nice and smart characters. As for sympathy, the protagonists of Say Yes are a pair of characteristic brides. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond imagination. We try to count the ways in which they mistreat a terrified stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After a hitchhiker has threatened to kill you, make sure to tell him which hotel you are in when you postpone it. <br /> <br /> 2. Defeat the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, allowing him to file an assault complaint. <br /> <br /> 3. Don't worry about telling the stalker police and simply hiring (for no seemingly good reason) that the cops have been corrupted by him. <br /> <br /> 4. As you try to escape, leave your lady out of your sight as much as possible to make sure the stalker abducts her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, make sure you send them away as soon as possible so that you can face him one on one. It makes no sense to be unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect that a person would be immune to making some mistakes in these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it is actually impossible for the viewer to worry about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. This kills the enjoyment of the entire film. <br /> <br /> In case you are wondering, the writers did not stop with the obtuse characters. Since they themselves are certainly not very intelligent to write this crapfest, they have decided to make the situations so absurdly unreal that the whole sense of reality goes out the window. <br /> <br /> 1. Does the stalker kill a policeman inside a police station? while the protagonist falls asleep no more than three meters away. <br /> <br /> 2. The stalker engages in all sorts of questionable activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, yet no one except the married couple seems to notice his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The "suspense" scenes had no imagination. In fact, some scenes were direct repercussions from American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive thing is the beheading towards the end, which has been a rather brutal scene since it was inflicted on his wife. Too bad the filmmakers followed him with a shockingly stupid ending coming from the left field. Really, the Koreans behind the realization of Say Yes should be ashamed of themselves. Better yet, they should simply move to California and take up employment with people who produce films with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
