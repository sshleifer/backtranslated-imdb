PROBLEM CHILD is one of the worst films I've seen in the last decade! This is a bad movie about a wild boy adopted by two parents, but he gets in trouble later. That Junior can drive Grandpa's car. It can scare people with a bear. It can set a room on fire! It's a bad film as much as BATTLEFIELD EARTH. A sequel is an even worse fate. Rent the POLICE instead. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 on **** I give it.
