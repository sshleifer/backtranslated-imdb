The cover (which features a man with a scary pellet gun) would make him look like a martial arts movie. (Hardly.) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the United States) This film is full of homoeroticism. If you like that stuff, then this movie is not so bad. However, consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are numerous close-ups of groin and actor's asses, (A scene also features every actor with a swollen erection in his pants). The film is also immersed in bright colors like lime, peach and red. From a filmmaker's point of view, this film is a drag queen! Several scenes have characters standing EXTREMELY close to each other, who sometimes touch as they converse. Besides, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. Is there a message here that the directors want to convey? <br /> <br /> Do I have to go into the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts are grabbed in a fight). The martial arts scenes are short and unimaginative. There are no fantastic things here, just your standard moves that you would see in an old Chuck Norris movie. There is also a car chase scene that could be the first LOW speed chase staged.
