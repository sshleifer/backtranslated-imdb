It's not exactly a new storyline, but this romantic comedy makes the concept work. A young man (John Cusack) and a beautiful dead woman (Kate Beckinsale) continue to meet by chance and wonder if they are made for each other. Although both have been promised to others ... strangely they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere. A bit corny in some places, but love alive. Being a romantic I am almost obliged to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and the snow starts to fall. The finish is almost too sweet, but more deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deepest roles, but who the hell couldn't be hit by Beckinsale. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen in him. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is extravagant and fun. Watch this with your soul mate.
