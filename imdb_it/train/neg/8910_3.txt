This film has a very simple plot but somehow very ugly. The entire film is about a girl being sucked through a door into another dimension, then years later she is reopened by a witch while a group of friends (including the main actor who is having trouble getting past her ex-girlfriend who she is one of the other campers together with her new partner ... another girl ... it is true that they are lesbians and obviously there is some nudity without a particular reason). Unfortunately the demon follows the now-grown girl. Furthermore, unfortunately, none of these are ever explained. Where were they exactly? Where does the devil come from? How did you survive as a child in a place full of evil demons? Who the hell trained her and made her a gladiator outfit? The acting is terrible, I think, but it's hard to say because the writing is so bad, maybe there was just nothing they could do with it. I gave him a three because the wrestler was pretty good and the effects were pretty funny even though they were very cheap. I wouldn't recommend it, it wasn't bad enough to be fun.
