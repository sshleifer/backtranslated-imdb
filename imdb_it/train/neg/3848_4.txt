The film is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters coming together as mothers of doomed murderers. With the horrendous notoriety after the trial, the two women join and leave NY for California to open and study songs and dances for girls like Shirley Temple. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it becomes clear that Reynolds made a mistake in bringing Winters with her to California. Winters plays a profoundly religious woman who increasingly seems to come out of her swing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, women living together are receiving threatening phone calls. Reynolds, wearing a blonde wig, is soon attracted to the wealthy father of one of his students, played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> Agnes Moorehead, in one of her latest films, is briefly seen as Sister Alma, who Winters is a faithful listener of. <br /> <br /> The film really belongs to Shelley Winters. Here it is heavy and the heaviness seems to make it play even better. Winters has always been good at roles that put her nerves to the test. <br /> <br /> The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters on the piano that beats away with his totally absurd look?
