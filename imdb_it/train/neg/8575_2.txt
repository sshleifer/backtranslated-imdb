****** SPOILERS ****** <br /> <br /> The ostentatious radio presenter Kyser and his mediocre band are the excuse for Lugosi, Karloff and Lorre to collect a salary in this bland, parody of sporadically guarded haunted house. Lugosi is a mystic whose sessions are exhibited as a fraudulent attempt to crush a heiress fortune; Karloff is the butler and Lorre is a professor who exhibits false mediums, but it appears that both are in conspiracy with Lugosi. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kay Kyser and her group of 30-year-old "kids" discover the truth with as little humor as possible along the way. Not recommended for anyone, but for complete horror.
