Before commenting on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked it out was to review something I saw for the first time in TV ads in 1980: the neckline by Barbara Bach. And since the film received an R score, I expected to see her naked. Alas, nothing to do for her or the other beautiful actress who appeared here: Stacey Nelkin who should be a teenager but actually was 20 when she did this. Seeing her in a bra and panties and later in a belly dancer dress was as exciting as Mrs. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughter that this film provides. Actually, I don't blame Ron Leibman for the fact that his name was removed from the credits since his Liceman werewolf role is rather embarrassing even though I like the "seduction" scene he did with Mrs. Nelkin . This is also the debut of Ralph Macchio who is the loner among the misfits sent to an academic school. The others are a black guy who really loves his stepmother and Mrs. Bach, an Arab who loves motor oil, and the son of a politician who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much, he risks sneak into the middle of the night. in the girls academy. Among the supporting casts, Tom Poston plays a rebellious character named Sisson whom I found partly amusing. With a script by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and directed by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo in the early stages of a football scene), Up the Academy is erratic with politically incorrect humor, but unless you are really offended by the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and his cover brand boy, Alfred E. Newman, should not be ashamed of even if they once their name and character have been removed from the picture. .PS Another of the "misfits" was Harry Teinowitz who was born in my hometown of Chicago, Illinois. He played Rodney Ververgaert. He also says one of my favorite phrases: "I'm trying to come".
