Basically there is a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there is a zombie in his closet and his parents fight all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> OK, first of all when you have to shoot a movie you have to decide if it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama the film is watchable. Parents divorce and argue like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet that totally ruins the whole movie! I expected to see a film similar to BOOGEYMAN, and instead I watched a drama with some senseless spot thrillers. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 only for the dialogues of parents and descendants who play well. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.
