Lucky me! I had a preview in this pathetic "horror" film shot by Artisan Entertainment a week before it reached the video shelves and let me say ... I rarely laughed so much in my life as I did watching this atrocious megabomb fly away from binary and steals the title of "worst clown killer movie ever made" from the unbearable fiasco of Full Moon KILLJOY (I'm sure many of us horror fans have suffered for that!) From all indications, it was shot on DV , and in reality it doesn't seem "bad" for digital, but the boy fails miserably in all the other areas where it counts! <br /> <br /> The story (light and clich√© as it is) behaves as follows ... An executive (Ken Hebert, who also wrote and co-produced with the director) takes skeptical colleague Tracy (Amanda Watson ) and the horny married couple Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck) during a weekend in a secluded shack (12 miles) from the nearest town. Along the way, they pick up a bitchy / slut hitchhiking (Melissa Bale) in a bar and end up at their destination where a nocturnal fairy tale of a murderous clown chasing the same wooded area is felt when each of the sworn-yackin, pot-smokin's friends they disappear one at a time, with only parts of mutilated dolls abandoned to tell the story of their destinies. <br /> <br /> The killer clown does not even appear in the film until the end and it seems nothing like the demonic depiction of this in the videotape (besides being morbidly obese). He spent almost an hour hopping in the woods, chopping wood and rhyming with nursery rhymes. I can't say enough bad things about the cast, especially the two boys and the hitchhiker girl, who offer their tasteless dialogue with a minimum of enthusiasm or excess in the most inappropriate moments. It doesn't really help that the script is completely and completely free of suspense, originality, intelligence, general coherence or humor. I could go on for days about how inept this film is, how many continuity errors there are and how amateurish the whole production is, but I'll just nod, pointing out that the whole package is rather a riot in that Boy-This-Kids some sense. <br /> <br /> Noting also that the film was released here in the US as SICK (SERIAL CLOWN KILLER). It is currently cataloged under its (original title) of GRIM WEEKEND. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
