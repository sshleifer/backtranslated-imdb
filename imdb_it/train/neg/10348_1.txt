I was very happy to see that they had made a film from my favorite book ever. I didn't realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled by the numerous omissions of crucial parts of history. It was as if someone made a film out of a student's book report of the novel. Meg was fine at school and neither she nor her father wore glasses. Ms. Murray (Meg's mother) was not at all represented as a scientist; they left his kitchen workshop outside and replaced it with internet. And this is only the beginning. In the middle of the film I found myself screaming at the screen, much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book. I wish I had more inches so I could give four inches down for this. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this film is fine.
