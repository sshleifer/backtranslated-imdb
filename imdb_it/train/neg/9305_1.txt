A friend and I rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. Before acting ... wow ... the acting was the worst, even the effects were really bad, it looked like a movie made by a college guy. The plot was pretty good, but it had been done. The thing that ruined the films most was the actors. The main character was the worst actor ever ... it's a pity he even called him an actor ... The only good thing about this film was that it was so bad that it was funny ... so if you want a good laugh see it .... but apart from that ... stay away from this. I usually love movies from the B series and the like, but this ... I don't know how it was even put on video ... this is the worst I've seen ... and I've seen bad ones.
