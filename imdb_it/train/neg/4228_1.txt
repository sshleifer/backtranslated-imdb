I can't believe how bad this piece of junk is! I want my $ 3.99 back! The words challenge the description of this piece of shit done wrong! The dubbing in no way shape or form is in line with the mouths of the actor. It looks like the film was shot on a vintage 70s camcorder. I've made better films with my cell phone camera. Blood is ridiculous because of the incredible stupid plot. Acting is what you would expect if you called all your friends Saturday afternoon and proceeded to rip them off completely, then try to stage a game in your garage. Don't get me wrong ... I didn't expect O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie that they are unsightly. To avoid!
