Some might say something like "Baby Genius" with its giant robotic newborns or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drugged nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing film ever made for children. You could say it too, but you would be wrong. That's why I bring you: Santa Claus, the most messed up family film since ... well, never. <br /> <br /> From the opening scenes that show children from different parts of the world singing their insipid thematic songs (seriously, this segment is almost 20 minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot! ) for the exciting conclusion that Merlin emerges from outside nowhere and saves the day (don't worry, it's from Barcelona), this is the childhood trauma at its best. And no matter how hard you try, no matter how many different therapists you visit, I ... can't ... get ... those ... reindeer ... laughter ... out ... of. .. my head! <br /> <br /> Avoid this piece of junk that will make you avoid the sex-hungry whale during the mating season. However, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of exaggerated flu are something to you, I guess you should give it a try. But really, this film is not worth your time and your mental health.
