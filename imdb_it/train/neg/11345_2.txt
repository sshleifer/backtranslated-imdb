I mean the word "pawn". It seems that the producers of the film have forgotten to make something interesting happen. Faith Domergue can do better than this. It should be the mysterious and vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (is there an idea, eh?). Instead it is a common housewife of the fifties, and the unique and flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think that they fired early in the morning before Faith had coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so intensely "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This is the most productively covered land in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cult of the Cobra" should be titled "Cult of the Contractual Obligation". Otherwise, why would so many talented people otherwise have their way of crossing their path through a slow, predictable and derivative failure like this?
