I don't remember that "Barnaby Jones" was just a very bland detective show, in which, as with every Quinn Martin show, Act I was the murder, Act II was the main character who understood the murder, Act III was the hit on stage (another murdered character), Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty (Lee Meriwether) asking his father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) how he discovered the crime and then someone who said something of witty end of the show. <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the excellent song by composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely, the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show for all seven seasons when the show was on the air. I must also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a different role than Jed Clampett, although Ebsen was discontented. I just wished the show was more fun than when I first remembered it. <br /> <br /> Update (11/1/2009): I saw an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their channel Archive of American Television. Let's just say I was nicer than Goldsmith about the "Barnaby Jones" show.
