I can't believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is from a director I enjoyed quite a bit. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and will do nothing but "lasting"), left me in a bad mood, a condition raised only by reading IMDb's comment by ali-112. Because not only did Rohmer attempt (successfully) to show us the world through 18th-century French genre art but, as Ali pointed out, he demonstrated (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of class consciousness and the revolution that inspired the eyes of an unlikely elitist woman of her time. The director has achieved something undeniably difficult, but I wonder if it was worth the effort he was made to do it - or that we observed the boring results of his work.
