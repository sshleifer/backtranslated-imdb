Blades, clich√©s, superhero drivel action movies. I had high hopes for this film, and the kind of HK police actors is one I don't disregard, but very rarely do I see a plot as banal and ridiculous as this. This would have been forgivable, as always in this type of film, when the action compensates, unfortunately, it is not so. The action brings the surreal trademark and tip nature of the HK action, but it is not very engaging, obscenely bloody, and in fact often completely incoherent (perhaps this is due to the re-editing for the American version, shows signs in many patchwork places). I was very disappointed.
