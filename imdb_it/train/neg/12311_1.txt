I know I've already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something ... <br /> <br /> I'm not an old fogy from the Baby Boom generation who grew up glued to a flickering b / w image by Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc. <br /> <br /> Bilko was already 20 years before my birth, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's Bilko courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would have liked Steve Martin's disguise if I hadn't seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I don't know - maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think this film is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If after seeing the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin and others, keep thinking that Steve Martin's film has something above a '2' - I'll stand next pint ...
