Despite the subject, this is an amateur film, an exhibitionist - or an effort for one - that is as interesting and bold as the composition book of a moody student of the school full of "poems" of death. Of course, it will disturb the spectators who are determined to be disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. To really get into someone's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film contains an evocative image, shown as a snapshot (and also used in the case of video), but without development that leads to or moves away from it. If the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting film - that is, a film.
