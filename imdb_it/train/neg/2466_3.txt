In recent years there has been a fad for ironic films, often not of the genre, and other media incarnations about carnivorous resurrected deaths. "Fido" is a film that is an attempt to profit from it, simply its manifestation, or both - and it fits perfectly into the category of ironic zombies. The joke here is that we can see the dead walking in the contrasting context of a stereotyped, perfectly clean, alternating story (we are in the wake of a great Zombie War, and the creatures are now tamed as slaves) version of a suburb of the years 50. <br /> <br /> It's a moderately fun concept by itself, and maybe enough for a five-minute comic sketch, but it can't hold a feature film alone. The joke that rotting corpses for servants are incongruous with this idealized version of a small city is repeated over and over again and loses all effectiveness. The soundtrack tirelessly plays sunny melodies while the zombies cannibalize passersby. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted in a family line, otherwise familiar, for an economic attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The vastness and artificiality of the representation of the "nineteen fifties" here can only irritate me. It is so stylized, in it evidently inspired by "Pleasantville", that it is more evident in the swaying signs of its fifty years that in reality it does not resemble something that could have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something that hatefully on it, as if the film boasted in a superficial and reckless way about how much they are more open, fair and superior to the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Given that the characters are such large representations of the "types" of the years Fifty of pop culture, it is difficult to develop a great emotional investment in them. Everyone has some character traits thrown at him - Helen is obsessed with appearances, and Bill loves golf and its frequented by having to kill his father - but they remain rather two-dimensional. Performance within the limits of this bad writing is fine. The best is Billy Connolly in the role of Fido the zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually gives character and sympathy to a bulky green monster who can't speak. <br /> <br /> There are small parts of the cheerful allegory thrown around - to commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, etc., but none of them really works at a global level, and the directors don't; really stick to anything <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie doesn't go unnoticed with the bizarre "Look! Zombies in 'Leave it to Beaver!" "for an hour and a half good.
