I don't even want to call this a movie - it's a film that shouldn't have won any prizes. The acting was horrible as the silly scenarios were. This is exactly the kind of film that so many people think is aimed at an NRI audience, but is actually detested abroad for its clumsiness and the overwhelming sense of "trying" throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I find it strange that so many actors who speak the English language find it so difficult to do so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I'm talking about - all those token English sentences thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for interesting points. There are few Indian films where English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was recent. Although it's not a great film, it was a good movie and the language didn't seem like "mass". <br /> <br /> I am ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-amusing parts of this junk were Konkana and a rather catchy background score. In addition to this, don't waste your time with this movie.
