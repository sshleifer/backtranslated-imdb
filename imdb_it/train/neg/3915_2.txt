This film is not only scripted and directed, but simply unpleasant. A good novel is terribly misrepresented in this film. Many changes have been made to the plot, presumably to optimize time. But what results is simply a source of confusion. Acting cannot overcome the script that removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Furthermore, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the EsTEban patriarch as ESteban. Horrible. Please, please, please read the wonderful novel, in Spanish if possible. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
