I happened to love the show growing up, along with millions of others. So I tuned into this movie, thinking if it wasn't good it could be at least a little dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> WRONG! I just have to ask myself, at the end of this, that Charlie's Angels is really boring? I don't seem to remember it as such. But this film, however ugly a film of this type may be, has had little resemblance to the excitement of that period and show. I saw everything, despite the negatives, it was not unwatchable. But it was very bland, which is not at all impeccable for the artists, particularly for the women who played the angels as they really seemed to. The film was not so interesting. He tried to make each angel a "character". (An angel is exuberant, one is the "good girl", one is that of her husband ...), all the characters have been portrayed with a main characteristic that defines them and little deepened beyond stereotypes. The excitement of the show was lacking and the dialogue was ... dialogue. This is pretty much everything. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. It's not the worst of TV movies. But missing.
