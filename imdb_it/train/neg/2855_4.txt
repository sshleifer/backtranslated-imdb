"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call ... it just didn't hit the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I don't like Gangster comedies (as I also thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia). It's probably more of a "sharp and sharp word game" than Comedy, only it's not as witty and sharp as (or other reviewers). <br /> <br /> The Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old to start making it a gag that ran sometimes it was painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There were no changes in location or feel for the period in which they should have been. Most of the film was set in "Dreyfus's Club" or in a variety of dark offices / rooms. .. (what was happening with that Sit down Gun that Goldblum kept winning?) <br /> <br /> The supporting cast was ... on excellent Paper (nice to see Silva and Drago) but the characters were killed before they had time to develop. and the cameo of Richard Pryors was a joke! The Romance and Love element of the film also bogged it down. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don't think I'll be back soon.
