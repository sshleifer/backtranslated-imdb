The Leap Years is the protagonist of some great hitters in the local and regional film and television scene. Still, they can't save this movie. There are so many things going against it - beyond acting, overly melodramatic script, bad script, inconsistent direction; and too few things to do it - good music, good cinematography. This comment is mainly for those who throw all local movies into a basket after watching this movie and say that all local movies are bad. Please don't judge the rest based on this movie. This is a television soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed for five minutes in the film.
