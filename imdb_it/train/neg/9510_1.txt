Sugar & Spice is one of the worst films of 2001. The film tries to cross Heathers and Bring It On and fails. When I saw last January I was so disgusted with the movie that I walked and talked to my girlfriend on my cell phone for the last half hour of the movie. I heard that the DVD has a director's cut, maybe I'll check it out, but this PG-13 junk movie is s *** and the worst kind of s ***. Maybe if the movie had a T & A that would have gone well. But the gags are lame and the acting is horrible. Worse than a Troma movie.
