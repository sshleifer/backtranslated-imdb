When I think back to my university days at Ohio University, there will always be an event I will remember with fond memories. Channel 23 is the local access channel of the OU and until a few years ago, practically everything that was sent sounded. This included many do-it-yourself movies that ranged from a boy who marshalled Peeps marshmallow and then scanned them online, to a version of Macbeth with 8-year-old protagonists that apparently had just learned to ring. <br /> <br /> However, the king, in my opinion, channel 23 was Midnight Skater. The first time I saw it was around 2 am. I should have studied O sleep OR watching normal TV. But no, everything is for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was completed, I don't think any of us believed any movie had just happened. But it's pretty sure, it was a few nights later, and we had to deal with the fact that this film actually existed. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on about how horrible it is, but it's the kind of horrible that makes life worth living. The plot is disconnected, the acting is terrible, the soul healed, but for god, if there are others watching you, it's impossible not to have a good time looking at it. It's like the first time you hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You feel it, you're disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and want is to let someone else experience the abject horror you've just endured. <br /> <br /> Short story, Midnight Skater, for all its epic flaws, makes it very fun late at night. Also, I desperately want the Midnight Skater theme. Congratulations to anyone who wrote and sang it. Sweet God, I love that song.
