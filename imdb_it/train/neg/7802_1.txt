A spill of chemicals is turning people into zombies. It is up to two doctors to survive the epidemic. It's a film by Andreas Schnaas, so you know what the par for the course is. Bad acting, horribly terrible special effects and no budget to talk about. Dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write a single word about this piece of excrement, least of all the ten lines are mandatory due to the guidelines given me by IMDb. My original one-word review: Crap wouldn't fly so I have to see it again and go more as it's ugly. But I don't know if I can, so ... wait I think I might have enough words, or rather lines to pass this review. Which is nice, I guess. So in summary: this movie sucks the balls, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
