I read the man who runs from Kings books like Bachman and heard the main character John and his family. This film could have been much more. The problem? It was set during the big action movie craze. I saw the movie and suffered throughout the film. I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause. Yes, he had funny (or ridiculous) scenes even though I think he didn't save the film in my eyes. If you read the book you can hear the climax and fire in John's heart as he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a low number. It may not have been so low if you hadn't read the book.
