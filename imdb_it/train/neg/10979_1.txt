Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this film is. I wish it was "so bad it's beautiful", but it's not. It's just boring, lifeless and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it. <br /> <br /> In response to other posters, Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the film. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly, who as a true affirmation on vanity, has launched himself as the male protagonist. They both look like inbreeds, sister and brother. <br /> <br /> The girl, Sherry Thurig, is a looker. The exact opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and supple and can act. Even if you can say that you're holding back. <br /> <br /> All the actors seem to hold back, especially the support male, Mark. I've seen less wood in a rainforest, but it's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly prevent her actors from acting? Is a director really that bad? Everyone else summed up the story perfectly - there isn't one. The children are kidnapped and Kelly poop to solve the crime. I know how he felt about taking a step into his poop, it's how I felt after seeing his movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I tried to get my money from the rental shop. This is a home movie that is best left to be seen by the director's friends (and if you look for them, you will see that those same friends were the ones who gave the film positive votes).
