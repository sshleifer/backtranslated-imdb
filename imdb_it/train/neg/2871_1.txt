I rented this awful movie. The worst I think I've ever seen. I think a first-grade class could have done a better job. The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad guys. Nothing scary except that I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of junk. The scenes of the slavery house have such a low budget that they look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is that if you want to waste a good evening and a little money go and rent this horrible movie. I'd rather watch the murderous clowns from outer space as they sit in a bucket of razors that returns to the flop again
