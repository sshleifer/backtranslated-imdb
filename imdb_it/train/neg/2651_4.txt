The first 30 minutes of the film were uncertain and hard to know what was happening (unless you read the book - which I didn't have). <br /> <br /> If you can stay faithful to the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet anyway. <br /> <br /> The way it was filmed was thought to have been produced in the early 1980s, not in 2005. <br /> <br /> No prominent moment, tasteless, but it went on without getting bored. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know why Keaton chose this role, his part would have been better cast with a player more at the level of the other actors to keep the balance.
