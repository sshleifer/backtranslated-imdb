This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not funny, not dramatic, not fun. Sarah Michelle Gellar lived up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fear and shock. He couldn't sell his character and nobody else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought that Grudge was "kind", then don't go see it unless you enjoy not wasting your time and your life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for free, so I don't want this to be interpreted as a grimace of a guy who lost $ 8 in a terrible movie. It was free, still sucked, I hated. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
