OK, if you're looking for another Bastketball Diaries, this is completely the wrong movie. <br /> <br /> Around two brothers. Max, the youngest, has a severe cocaine addiction. Adam, the firstborn, is a doctor. This film is supposed to show the plunge from reality to the least extreme that drugs make possible. However, it does not. It shows that cocaine can be fun regardless of the situation that arises. Most of the film focuses on Max and his farewell ways. In the end, Adam can no longer take the stress out of his job and even starts using (persecution drugs). <br /> <br /> This film has almost reached its climax. He doesn't get into what cocaine really does for you, he has boring, low-budget scenes, and the acting of his older brother, Adam, is horrible. <br /> <br /> I have no idea how this film was managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a lover of the heart. If you want a film of clear and true history in the extreme world of drugs, if you don't buy "The Basketball Diaries". And notice the difference. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie but, if you think you like it. Try to see for yourself ...
