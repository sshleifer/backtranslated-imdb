The Brain That Would Not Die is a terrible piece of film that stinks from the headlines. It has all the classic signs of the bad: incredible plot, terrible acting, set design and low-level lighting. The plot goes like this: when a doctor and his girlfriend get caught in an accident, she is beheaded and he lifts his head and takes her to his laboratory, where he puts his head in a pan with special liquid that keeps her alive. I bet Virgnina Leath, who played the head in a pan, had to spend a lot of time uncomfortably wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table. However, the doctor tries to find her a new body and hires two strippers so she can pick one to get her new body. Ugly all the way, so much has been torn to pieces on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
