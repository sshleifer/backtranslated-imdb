They probably should have called this movie The Map because most of the whole stupid movie is filmed around a map of a cemetery. Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map are there. The only thing they show more than the map itself are the small beads of sweat that constantly accumulate on the forehead of our main character. This of course was the way the filmmakers showed us how incredibly tense things are getting up in the Immortal Hills cemetery. Come on now, couldn't they have shown us only one of the scenes of death? We hear a lot about how all those listed on the map are falling like flies but we see nothing. Some like Bury The Living were handled to keep my attention, so I was pretty generous with the rating I gave him, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you have a deep passion for maps or sweat, I suggest you rent a best movie, like I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood.
