I really wanted this movie so much. He has a beautiful prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, a horrible 1980s touch and is a directorial effort of actor John Saxon, who also plays a villain (you guessed it) a villain. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror movies. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmare / scary moment. It goes on and on and on, and then (logically) it must end. More suspense and bolder images and his destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed.
