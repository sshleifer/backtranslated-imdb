Please let me forget. Please. Please. This is the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I consider the film an insult to my brain and my backside that both have suffered from me sitting and watching this movie. I have yet to see what damage has caused my vision and my ability to complete sentences. What a load of garbage !! And don't let me start acting ... Someone, please, help me forget !! "Weird Science" - come back! Everything is forgiven ... <br /> <br /> I am "proud" to give this film the first 1 here on IMDb ... And I voted for hundreds of movies ... Many of them c ** but this it's so bad I can't even believe it. Did anyone actually get the idea and thought it was worthy of becoming a movie? Has anyone actually read the script and decided to produce the film? Has anyone read the script and audition for this? Has anyone seen the film and decided * not * to put it on a shelf to collect dust for eternity? * These * are the questions I want to answer. Not the philosophical question about that tree in the woods and well, you know ...
