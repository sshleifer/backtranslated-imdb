I don't know why I'm taking the time to review this wasted movie. If you stick long enough in the hope of a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising ?? they don't. It ends up fading away after rigid, formal and predictable dialogue and acting. The indoor scenes are so harshly lit that you think if the camera had been shrunk by a millimeter, you would have seen the Klieg lights. Costumes, hair and sets are starched, pressed and immaculate. Should we imagine that ordinary people really lived that way in Arizona in the 20th century? Comparisons of other reviews with Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least that director has woven his violence in the context of chaos and chaos. The blood of HARD men is free explosive squibs from impersonations in bad wood with manicured nails. Huh?!? I can believe that Heston thought he could get something of value with this movie. (Comes to pick up the gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I will never guess why he joined this parody. Do you want to see a film about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of Westerners as we knew them? Look again at THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN. THE LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of an obituary for the West.
