But it has some good deeds and a plot that is somehow interesting. Nevsky behaves like a body builder and is not that attractive, in fact, IMO, he is ugly. (her acting skills are missing!) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character had to be developed. There are too many men in this story, there is no love story, too much action and too stupid for an ending. It's very violent. I love the scenery anyway, this movie takes you all over the world and that's a bonus. I also liked how there was something about the mafia, not too much or too little, but enough to get my attention. The actors had to be nicer ... The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be pretty sexy, but for us women who are fans of action, Nevsky doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I didn't love it or hated it, I just found another normal action movie.
