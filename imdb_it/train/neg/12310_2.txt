Steve Martin should stop trying to do remakes of the classic comedy. He absolutely does not fit this part. Like the painful remake of Out Of Towners, this movie falls unnoticed. How come someone thought that Steve Martin could even get close to the wonderful Jack Lemmon show goes beyond me and the same goes for this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played Bilko better. Martin is great when he makes his original characters, but fails miserably trying to recreate other people's classic work. It's a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the film is finished. The phrase "The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation from the US Army" was the only line that made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show. These are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I put this film in the same category as the Lemmon classic mentioned above and in the Psycho remake. None of them should ever have happened.
