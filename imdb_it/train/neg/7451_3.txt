Sorry, it's not good. <br /> <br /> Start interesting, but lose your way in a few minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help much that none of the great actors normally (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) offers a really good performance. <br /> <br /> It could be due to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (German), but the character of Dennis Quaid was particularly wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover is not really a credible villain. Moreover, the character of Jared Leto does not really contribute to the story (except to save the life of a main character at some point, but that scene is as necessary as a wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-) <br /> <br / > Speaking of useless scenes - the main complaint is actually the intricate plot marked by the clich√©: the detective (obviously!) Must solve a personal issue with the villain and is (obviously!) Suspended from his official duties by courtesy of his personal involvement. The killer (of course!) * He wants to * be tracked down and play for years with his opponent in a cat and mouse game ... I don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - many of them better, anyway. <br /> <br /> The plot has holes galore and many absolutely incredible and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute or work well with the plot (for example the truck scene or the car on the edge of the cliff etc.). ) <br /> <br /> Finally, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these aspects. We have seen much better * endings with a similar kind of final battle setting on a desolate-winter-train ... In the end there is the seemingly moving meeting of parent and child ... hokey, at least.
