this movie was a horrible excuse for ... a movie. first of all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn the main character looked nothing like his television mom. <br /> <br /> furthermore, the plot was pathetic. it was extremely obvious and predictable. the ending was very disappointing and cheap. (but that's all I will say about this). <br /> <br /> the nail in the bag though, was a scene in which Katelyn (jordan hinson) should have been crying, but the girl could not cry on command! there were no tears running down her face, just some incredible sobs. she is not a dynamic actress at all. gave the same fake giggle identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie Maguire (sp?). this is when the film has gone from not-so-good, to simply bad. he really seemed to be acting. <br /> <br /> in a nutshell: this movie was really bad! it was a kind of mix of every clich√© child movie from the 90s that everyone's fed up with - just worse! <br /> <br /> I gave him an "F", because it was really so hard to seduce (b / t / w, I was a baby sitter when I saw it). <br /> <br /> however, you may like it if you are under 9 years old. ;)
