My first complete Heston film. The film that everyone knows already at the end. A "science fiction thriller". The campy factor. Everything that accompanies this film was injected into my head when I rented it, and the morning I looked at it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in (not wanting to move. In the blankets). And even though I tried to understand what was happening to bring to the finale that will be eternally ruined by pop culture, it didn't really make it. Everything was everywhere, the relationships had no backbone, the ending had no advantage. Everything was just somehow strange in some way and the observer has no choice but to leave partially astounded in the end that comes, because even though we all know that they are people, it is a quick answer to why people do any Serious attempt to enjoy the movie for something other than stupidity thrown out the window.
