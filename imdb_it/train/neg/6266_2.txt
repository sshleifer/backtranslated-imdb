It seems that anyone can make a movie nowadays. It's all you need is a camera, a bunch of people to be your cast and crew, a screenplay and some money and you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation and often these low budget films turn out to be jokes. The video store shelves are full of these so-called movies. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just a waste of celluloid which is best forgotten. Troma Entertainment is known for its junk movies, but most movies are golden movies. However, some of the films they published had nothing to do with making and some, like "Nightmare Weekend", didn't deserve any form of release. <br /> <br /> Pros: Cast members do the best they can with bad material. Some involuntary hilarity. It moves at a good pace (should be at 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Cons: Terrible writing, which includes putrid dialogues and innumerable holes in the plot. Poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't understand at all. It does not make sense. Badly marked. Economic and very dated effects. Total lack of character development and nobody will care about you. This should be a horror movie, but it's missing in that area and it's not scary at all. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding. <br /> <br /> Final considerations: I never expected this to be a forgotten gem, but I never imagined it would be so bad. I don't know if it's the worst movie ever made, but it's a precise contender. Troma should let this film rot instead of giving it a release. Don't make the same mistake I made and let your curiosity get the best of you. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
