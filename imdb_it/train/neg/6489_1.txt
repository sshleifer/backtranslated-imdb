What seemed like a good premise for a movie ... unfortunately it can't reach almost all levels. Very difficult to follow at the beginning of the film, in reality I found myself fighting the urgency to turn it off, the biggest problem from a visual point of view is the fact that the camera simply works over the top with so many "arty" subliminal splicing and semi-cuts throughout the film that actually distract you from the general story. It's really too challenging to immerse yourself in the moment and build a suspenseful ending, but the film has so many semi-conceived characters and an irrelevant script that leaves you disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep it.
