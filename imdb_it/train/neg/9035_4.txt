Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching TV "Movies of the Week" in the early 1970s and loved the gruesome movies that were usually shown including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald", "Satan's School for Girls" , "Kolchak the Night Stalker", etc., but this is simply stupid. Obviously the writer is trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders of a few years earlier. The film sees Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" as a father who takes his family on a beach camping. The family meets some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifist attitude is difficult to digest. For God's sake, call the police, beat hell or something, just don't sit there and complain about it. The acting is rather lame, the story incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks pretty in a bikini, but that's all. Ignore this if it goes on TV.
