My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of Modesty Blaise's origins. It's not that the film is terrible, it's not just what I expected or hoped for. While I have known Modesty Blaise's character for years, I am not very familiar with comics or graphic novels, so I come to this film as something foreign. This could be part of the reason for my disappointment. I expected more action and more comedy. The film is guided by dialogue. I suppose I was looking for something with an extra camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deadly serious film. There are few, if any, "light" moments. Acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is acceptable but nothing exceptional. As others have commented, it seems a bit too fragile to be completely credible in the lead role. What action scenes are in My Name is Modesty are one of the weakest points in the film. I never believed that this woman could handle a band of trained assassins. I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and calls his name a big budget movie based on the character of Modesty Blaise. I am convinced that the concept has great potential and I'm looking forward to it.
