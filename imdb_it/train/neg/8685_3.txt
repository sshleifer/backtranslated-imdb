Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a series of cartoons with a lot of funny (but rearranged and exaggerated) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more. <br /> <br /> The writing was absolutely pathetic. Apart from Cheney-Chicken-Eating's joke, and a few small banners, it was really boring and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The animation was as sophisticated as the thirteen-year Flash Project. It is shameful that they used the Macromedia product for this, because it can do much more. <br /> <br /> I don't like Bush very much, and I like both a Bush joke and the next, but this was just a half-hour shot at the President with several painfully little funny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did much more with That's My Bush. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, skip "Lil 'Bush" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy "That's My Bush". You will thank me.
