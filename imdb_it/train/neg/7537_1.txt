And I thought The Beach was ugly, with the difference that this film has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the horrible script, if someone can make sense of what the hell was the point of that movie, pat yourself on the back. It's a cross between The Village and a disgusting script. Its beginning begins to attract your attention, and then while it goes further into the plot, it makes no sense, and not to let me start on the final !!!! What was that? The only thing that makes this movie is Nicolas Cage, a great humor and his ability to be funny in the strangest situations. If you go to a blockbuster movie and this is the only movie to watch, save five dollars and go home and run, put something on fire and when someone asks you why, just say the stupidest thing that comes to you in mind, and here you are!
