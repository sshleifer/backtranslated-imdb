This film was amazing. It is beyond atrocious. I often meet with a group of friends and go to the cinema to find horrible movies to watch for their comic value. My friend suggested this, but as we watched it, people started to leave. I really wanted to finish it, just to be able to say it, but I couldn't. It's so bad. Horrible racing gags, lame agitation. The main characters are an annoying klutz dinosaur and Whoopi Goldberg. I'd rather watch Costener's The Postman twelve times in a row than see a fraction of this movie again. I think they try to tackle some problems of discrimination of dinosaurs, but the part of the film that really stands out is the dinosaur that keeps tipping things over, and then laughing about it. It hurts. See if you are an aspiring masochist, otherwise leave this alone.
