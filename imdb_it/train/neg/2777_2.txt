Unfortunately, this was shown on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. It's a complete recitation. As another member said, this film is a good example of "how not to act". I haven't seen a movie that played so badly for a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) They are completely flat and offer their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad acting is, you should see the movie ... but it would be torture. <br /> <br /> It makes me shudder as the protagonist brings her lines and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or artificial) is equally atrocious. Another actress with a false British accent was pretty, yes, but the good gentleman was her terrible accent. Mix this with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. He shouldn't have said anything and I could have accepted her as a beautiful girl. Oh my God, we just got to the scene where the protagonist's lover says "Really me?" after a scene of forced crying on his part. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed loudly. <br /> <br /> Sets and artistic directors offer a little grace to the film. Some sets are colorful and some scenes are pretty nice (minus the actors). <br /> <br /> The old lady of the magic potion? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the film. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set around 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the film was considered "Big Budget" in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this film. I just go to show that money is not necessarily a good (or even mediocre) film. I would give the King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and set designs save the film from a 2 out of 10 rating.
