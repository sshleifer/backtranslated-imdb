I will not waste my time writing anything more about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad. This has already been done in many details, many times. The "plot" began as a hilarious cockney male / gangster by number bored and very quickly descended into total disarray. Someone who pretends to see a masterpiece hidden in this terrible mess is only joking. It's been 7 or 8 years since I saw him during his week-long run at the cinema before he was pulled, yet it remains in my mind to easily be the most terrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm just making these comments, and in fact the only reason I went to watch the movie, is the funny fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second "heavy" in the scene of the pubs. They were his hands pushing a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan's face at the bar in "Russia" (in fact it was shot in the former Butlin holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he recently joined an agency for extras and this was his first part. After watching the movie, it seemed that no one in it required any acting experience. <br /> <br /> I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and this was only a couple of days after he was released. I've never heard of another film that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this movie on DVD, I suggest you put your two-pound coins in the fire until they get hot, then insert them into the eye sockets. This will probably be much less painful than watching the movie.
