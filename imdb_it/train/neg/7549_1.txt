If Edward Woodward was the film that watched this film, then he would be the one who would have screamed in horror. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry people, but enough is enough. We had Carter, Italian work, Alfie and now this. What are the similarities? No. It is not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals play Maurice Micklewhite and the other plays another great British actor. The main common ingredient in those originals is the British of the films. They were not made to impress Hollywood. They were bizarre English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that cannot be replicated in the United States. The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardize it with a remake or even a sequel. <br /> <br /> Wicker 06 had a difficult task before it even hit the road. Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic than other cult films; challenges the genre, the smart scripts, the A-level actors, the soundtrack, the set-pieces that defy the description and all the stories surrounding the film. <br /> <br /> So here's a remake. Don't worry No original was damaged in the making of this remake. Some important aspects of history had to be reworked for the modern United States: communications, paganism, virgins. But this is just the whole premise. So let's give the policewoman a Nam-style traumatic past complete with flashbacks of shocking music for the frightening skirmishes. So, with no mobile phone tree on the island that handles communication, but in the real world that would not happen. The cops are not lost. Give him a blood bond for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake. Even if the waffle is thin, isn't it? <br /> <br /> It's just that everything was done with a trowel. The alterations of the name were simply hammy, almost Carry On, there was no sense of community on the island, no city center for orientation, only a few houses scattered across a forest and that's it. Willow was simply annoying not revealing any information and Cage was useless to let her escape. When he went to the well, you knew he would be blocked. The script was reported until the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and finish. The epilogue was absolutely funny and he didn't know when to stop. <br /> <br /> That conclusion is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrible day. The other ends with a post-production "all-to-the-thick" conclusion. <br /> <br /> I loved the original but I went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the movie. I left grateful with the knowledge that this film will probably end up under a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever.
