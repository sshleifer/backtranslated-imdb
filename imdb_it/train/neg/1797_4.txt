This film has a very difficult premise to digest, even for the standards of this kind. We are asked to accept not only that a disc played backwards can bring a dead person back to life, but that the disc also contains hidden messages SPECIFICALLY addressed to a child, when the singer had no connection with the boy when he was alive, and obviously there was no way to know which hands would end the recording. However, the film is fun for a while, but ultimately stupidity and uselessness reign supreme. If they were really trying to create a new horror icon like Freddy, they were far away: the villain here has no personality, no motivation and no variety. (* 1/2)
