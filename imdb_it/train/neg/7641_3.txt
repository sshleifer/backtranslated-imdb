This is one of those films that tries to be moody and tense, and instead ends up stumbling over itself. After seeing him at a queer film festival, I was fascinated by the story of the "young college trio gone bad", but all in all he was rather disappointed. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to criticize a "real" story since there is not much that can be done about the plot - but I found this disconnected, melodramatic and completely depressing. It is dark and almost sinister, painting a disquieting and disturbing flash of the seventies with impressive music and jerky close-ups. It simply doesn't work - some scenes where it was so trivial that, instead of awe, my audience was suppressing laughter and rolling eyes. br /> <br /> History has an interesting premise, but this turns downward in a dark, miserable spiral.
