Scuba diving scientist William Hurt ??? US agents conducting investigations abroad? Does the sick and contaminated man kick his butt after falling 20 feet on his back and running away? Sniper misses and doesn't kill Hurt (only hurting him) but the second shot "kill" is he dead? Waste of time. Comparing this to falling down like other reviewers did is ridiculous. Oh, and at the end of the movie they decide to put their gloves on their hands except for the "bad" agent and Hurt decides to kill him by giving him the "viral handshake". What? BTW ... when did IMDb request 10 lines of text? I'm just chatting here. Is this not enough for the content of the reviews if you need to have x quantities of lines?
