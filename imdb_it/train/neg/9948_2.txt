Ice-T plays Mason as a homeless African-American who finds himself hunted by rich hunters (Rutger Hauer, Gary Busey, Charles S. Dutton, F. Murray Abraham, William McNamara and John C. McGinley), but Mason proves much more difficult then prey on the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow action star that takes too long to set actions and then make them totally unusable.
