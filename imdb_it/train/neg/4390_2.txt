The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as follows: "An experiment on a severed arm goes wrong", so I immediately thought that it was an arm that has its own mind as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or HAND or someone who gets an arm transplant like in PARTS OF THE BODY. Both structures are tried and tested, or to be more accurate tired and tested, so I was curious to know how the producers would deal with the story. Actually I thought they were making an auteur film like the PI until the black and white photography at the beginning of the film, but the producers seemed to get tired of this approach after 20 seconds and decided to create a similar splatter comedy to THE EVIL DEAD. I have very little to say about this except that I don't like EVIL DEAD movies and I didn't like SEVERED TIES and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is screaming for condoms
