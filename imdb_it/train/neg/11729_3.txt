Virgin is selected to marry a rich boy. The rich boy urinates. The woman in the boat loves the sailor. The sailor urinates. The Virgin attends the coarse common dinner. The man urinates at the table. Boatwoman strips for kids. The man who pretends to be little urine. There is a basic theme here. Makavejev is trying to say that he is luckier in the world. To say that this is a bizarre film is an understatement. To justify the title, there is a scene in which Laure, who barely speaks ten lines of the entire film, bathes in chocolate syrup. It's really a sweet scene, but the rest of the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth unless you happen to share the director's fetishes.
