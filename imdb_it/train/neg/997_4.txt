Having recently revised "Rossetto" for the first time in a few decades, I supported it with "Descent" although I heard more negative than positive comments from other movie friends with different tastes like mine. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the film Rape Revenge has evolved over the last 32 years, from the complete gore of "I Spit On Your Grave", to the gaudy "Lipstick" sensationalism, to the refined management of the problem in "The Accused". But "Descent", while making some important points, never really offers us something really new in terms of revealing meaning. No, "Descent" is so little realized in terms of image quality and sound that it removes any meaningful message that it could hope to do --- a message that, if carefully examined, is not so revolutionary. <br /> <I pretty much understand the plot. What I wanted to see * was * the "descent" or the degeneration of the character of Dawson. Being a big fan of Rosario, I was anxious to see the layers be stripped and his psyche slowly distorted ... you know, the kind of portrait DeNiro brings to "Taxi Driver". Unfortunately, the script and the choices of the director / writer do not provide any kind of credible transition. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second act. It became clear what the director's intentions were for this segment of club hopping, drug use and obsession with the great black stallion Adrian (every white boy's nightmare, natch) from a D & R on the DVD, but this hike in the Dawson's character is never credible made. We don't know exactly what the hell he's doing half the time, what he's looking for, or why he's doing it. The poor quality of the audio / video again does not help, but the sequence is too damn long and useless. It destroys any impulse and investment in the main character created during the first act, exceptionally well done. When we get to the end, our interest has already fallen. <br /> <br /> A point of success that Dawson emphasizes in the Q & A is that in the end the "revenge" scene is pumped to us as punishment, therefore realizing how horrible and ugly the reality is. While this is certainly valid, it does not make the scene more intriguing. <br /> <br /> If you have the DVD, take a look at the deleted "classroom" scene. This is an excellent 8 minutes longer that makes you crackle with energy and provocation (even if it's all verbal) and REALLY shows the slow crack-up of Dawson that materializes by delighting the poor and kind poor Francie Swift's poor councilor. If we had added other exhibition scenes like this one and more than the average third cut, we could have an interesting psychological study on the impact of senseless acts of violence. <br /> <br /> While the film is in the final cut, however, all we get is what we've seen before, only in a more graphic rendering. So?
