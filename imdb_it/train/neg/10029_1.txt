I had no idea what the movie was before I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while he was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything and they said "It's the directorial debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenplays for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the film playing it baby in his flashback ". <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I realized that theirs was not a real trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was extremely tough and even a 10-year-old child can invent a better plot. There was almost no action and the camera trembled at every possible angle and it is difficult to understand who is killing whom. Also the action was crazy and unrealistic for example. A man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. <br /> <br /> While watching Tashan he reminded me of 3 films: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: the terrible English of Anil Kapoor as Amrish Puri at Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageously ridiculous jokes that are not even funny. <br /> I also heard that the budget is 40 crores, which is the same amount as Dhoom 2 and I don't know where all the money went. However, if you did not like Dhoom 2, there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. The race was sky-high and is millions of times better. <br /> <br /> The only 2 beautiful songs are Dil Haara and Challiya and both songs are shot in Greece in good places, but what's the use? junk movie? Even the terrible English of Anil Kapoor could not save this defeat.
