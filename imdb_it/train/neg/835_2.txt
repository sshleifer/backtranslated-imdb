After seeing both the Lion King and the Lion King II, he had a lot of fun. I thought the Lion King 1.5 might be worth watching. What a disappointment ! Disney must be desperate for revenue. <br /> <br /> Especially now that they have lost the deal with Pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they just collected some parts of the movie that were left on the floor editor (or garbage can) and pasted together to make a quick dollar <br /> <br />. Unlike LK I and II, both with strong narrative lines. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't really have a story. While the characters and animations are always fun to watch, there's simply not enough material for a film here. Some of the pieces could be good filling discs of the second disc on the original offerings. <br /> <br /> Disney - Shame on putting this garbage to make a quick penny! <br /> <br /> Next time take your time and effort and put our work to good use.
