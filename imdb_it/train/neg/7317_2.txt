After reading the other comments on this film, I would like to share my opinion that this is a difficult film to see if you are not a total Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> When looked at by a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more distorted neuroses than they are capable of being absorbed in a single session. It's quite difficult to watch. The character of Brooks (Robert Cole) is so unpleasant and unpleasant that it is difficult to relate to him - not to mention root for him as he stumbles from a dysfunctional situation of self-absorption to the next. And you should NEVER make a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic setting. No man could have that very exposed foliage and he is supposed to light a child like Kathryn Harrold - unless, of course, he is Albert Brooks in a production controlled by Albert Brooks. <br /> <br /> "Modern Romance" has its funny moments ----- but they are fragmented and infrequent. Most of the time, I felt like I was on a journey confined to a completely uncomfortable person and wishing that it would end already. It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in one person --- someone who lacks self-discipline to be able to step back and see what is clearly happening. <br /> <br /> As many people probably know, James L. Brooks, who played the director in this film, is actually what he portrayed. Six years later, he directed Albert Brooks in the highly successful "Broadcast News". James showed us how Albert can give shape to a believable and amusing comic performance. Albert allowed us to see James (generally not chosen as an actor) make a comedic turn in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will be passed on to the next laudatory comment. To you I say ----- there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as entertainment.
