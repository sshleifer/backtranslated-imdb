I will be brief and to the point. This film was an insult to anyone who had IQ at room temperature. I'm sorry for liberals, feminists, etc. No woman will ever be a seal. They can forget the draft or be in combat. Not gonna happen. See, as difficult as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different. Not to mention that it is 2007, reality cannot change things so that people avoid hurting their feelings. Men can't give birth or breastfeed children (Oh, I forgot San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women do not have the physical strength to be on par with men in a fight or in other physically difficult situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Finally, I couldn't give a damn fun to hell if what I just wrote upsets you. Come to think of it - if this upsets you, it only warms my heart more. I didn't write something that wasn't the truth. This imbecile film is nothing but a comedy and a lousy one.
