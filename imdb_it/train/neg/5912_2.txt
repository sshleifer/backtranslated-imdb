Having enjoyed the previous work of Mike Myers (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations for a parody of the 60s were quite high. It became clear after the first minute that this was an exercise on how to be as childish and as fun as possible. After ten minutes I lost my head. I saw it the other day a second time to see if I had been unfair the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe that even a twelve year old boy can find this fun. The dialogue is embarrassing, Myers is painful to watch (like Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes things even worse. Apart from the slightly funny title and psychedelic set design, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Personally, I recommend avoiding this like the plague, although many friends liked me (maybe they were blindfolded at the time).
