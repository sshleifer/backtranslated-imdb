No one is a fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman cards than I am. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see only now that Richard Lester was directing Royal Flash, since he also made the Three / Four Musketeers with Fraser but I got pretty good. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 when the film was released and I couldn't have been more enthusiastic since I read all the Flashman documents published so far, and I was drunk with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (the I'm still, but never was given a chance later). <br /> <br /> What a disappointment (I saw it once more when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse. <br /> <br /> None of the sharp dialogues in the books are transferred to the screen. The Flashman character comedy seemed to me to have been poorly managed in the same way that one could imagine a group of high school students trying to make the parody. The duelist and fencing were horrible and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completely to take advantage of the possibilities of direct satire of previous film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <br /> If you read the book and did not see the film , I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg has become a fast friend and has made a game that Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of all this which the books speak. <br /> <br / > My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently, but I'm glad I didn't have it. <br /> <br /> If by chance Fraser reads this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation for that corpus of work, it's hard to believe that he wrote the script for this film, as he made all those terrible films by Roger Moore James Bond.
