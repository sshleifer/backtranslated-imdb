(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> This movie cannot be taken seriously. In some parts it is so terribly stupid that I can't help but laugh at everything. Try me for the sequence in which the character of Stallone jumps about 20 meters with complete climbing gear or (and this is really my favorite) makes a villain irritate attacking him to a stalactite. Yes, what wicked force has he gathered to accomplish such undertakings? I don't know, but it certainly gives a twist to reality.
