The film seems disjointed and overall, poorly written. The script proceeds as if 10 different people were writing it, and none of them communicated with each other. Apparently they wanted to take a page from a Miracle on 34th Street movie (the original film), but it is made in such a poor way that the movie collapses. This film is only for the very young, and they too will see the fact that whoever wrote it knows little or nothing about baseball. For example: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels died in the last place, doesn't the owner seem to worry, nor is he bothered by the fact that his manager has just quarreled with his pitcher ?? ON THE ROUND ?? or that PUNCHED the team game by playing the announcer live on TV. However, when the team is a match from the victory of the Division, it is folded into a story (originating from a 6-year-old child) that the manager receives help from a child who claims to see the true angels. What sounds worse? A losing and out-of-control manager whose team lost 15 in a row? Or a winning coach on the verge of the playoffs who is acting a little eccentric and helping foster kids? The owner's reaction makes no sense. And he moved to change his mind from Maggie and his 'straight out of the ordinary' speech at a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The Angels should play for the Division in the final series of the weekend against the White Sox, but at the end of the game the announcer continues to say that the Angels have won the pennant. "The pennant is not decided until someone wins the LEAGUE championship, not the regular season title. <br /> <br /> Whitt Bass, the goofball pitcher is the starting pitcher and wins the game that breaks the strip loser of the Angels ???? DAY. <br /> <br /> Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is said in the ninth inning to have thrown 156 shots, in a low score game. Typically in low scoring games, the Camp count is MUCH lower than this, usually around 80-90 shots. <br /> <br /> ?? "AL" says the angel at the end "The championships must be won alone", even if he and his angels have manipulated and adjusted games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever, since there are MANY other examples where the plot is poorly written. <br / > <br /> For the little ones (under 10), this movie could be fun, it's too bad - well done this could have been a classic. Done wrong this way and it's a forgettable mess that will live forever like a saturated UHF / cable Saturday.
