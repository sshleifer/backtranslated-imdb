The basic premise of this film is a political comic. I suppose for those who know nothing about military realities this is probably a "welfare" film about gender equality. In fact, a recent commentator has said: "let women know that they can do whatever they want to do". How disgusting! No one, man or woman, can do everything he wants to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "prepares" for SEAL Hell Week in the BUD / S program of the first week of 27 from some sessions in the local gym and his desire to be a SEAL simply will not. There is approximately an 80% dropout rate in what is probably the toughest military training program - those are the ones who voluntarily give up, cannot compete physically, suffer frequent physical injuries during training or fail to handle harassment psychology. I never went beyond the superficiality of the invented and pretended message of this film. In the real world, Demi would not have lasted the first 24 hours in this hard and prolonged physical training. Wanting alone will not. Skip this movie as wishful thinking and spend your time reading Dick Couch's "The Warrior Elite" (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what really happens in this workout. Ring the bell, Demi! <br /> <br />
