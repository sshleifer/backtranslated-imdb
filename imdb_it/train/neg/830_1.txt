I really don't understand all these positive user reviews. This film is the worst movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot but terrible in this film. But I don't think it's his fault but the directors. Somehow he managed to make everything look artificial; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything. <br /> <br /> The star I'm giving is just for the idea behind the film, which was very badly done. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this crap, go watch Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
