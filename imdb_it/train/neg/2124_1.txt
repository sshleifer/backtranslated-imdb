This film is about the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his return home of old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends that comes to light that Eddy left as a means to face the death of a friend in which he feels somehow responsible. But this is irrelevant, since the choices made in production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplays do not always need to be "talkative", but should at least contribute to the development of the story. Here a line attempts like "it just took off" or "I know you don't have love in your heart" just to fully evoke something that is worth the time of the public. Moreover, every time the writer feels short of where to go, he moves on to a musical montage of the protagonist who crosses the fields towards indie mood music. Talk about trying hard. If you are interested in a good movie, the kind that gives quality and substance to style only, then this is not the film for you.
