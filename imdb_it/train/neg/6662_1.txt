* Spoilers and extreme attacks await us * <br /> <br /> When this show started, I found it tolerable and fun. Fairly Oddparents was the kind of comic that appealed to children and adults. He also had high ratings with Spongebob. But it started to fall due to the subsequent crap that Butch Hartman and his team pushed into the show. <br /> <br /> First of all, the humor in the toilets isn't that fun. You can easily bring out a quick laugh from a small kiddie with a burp, but this is pretty much the only audience that would laugh at a clich√©-like joke. Then there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people dressing up. LOLOLOL !!! I can't stop laughing at such happy happiness! Somebody help me! But of course, this show would not be so dangerous were it not for the stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed the Australians? They saw them as nothing but iridescent loves, boomerang shooters living in a hot desert. But now ... It is the coup de grace of WHY this show really sucks all the noisiest ... OVERHEAD BOXES !!! The show constantly pulls the same lines (most of them are not funny) thinking that it's the best thing ever! Cosmo is mainly the one to blame. I hated how they kept mentioning "Super Toilet" (which also has a mixture of Kiddish humor in this one too) and Cosmo would get scared. And who could forget the stupid ram joke of the battery that every damned Dimmsdale parent would use in that one e-mail episode? You know, the one where every single parent (oblivious to other parents who said it) would say the same EXACT phrase before breaking into their children's room? Yes, it could be a first-class humor for some people, but it is pure s *** to others. <br /> <br /> If I'm not mistaken, I think Butch Hartman said something about finishing the show. Thanks God! Everyone around my area says it is, like, the funniest Nickelodeon show ever. Can't agree with it ?? I think it's just another pile of horse dung that we receive every day in our comic stations, only worse.
