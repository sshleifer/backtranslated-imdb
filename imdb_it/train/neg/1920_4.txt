I'm not saying that Night of the Twisters was horrible, but it was far from exceptional. Mediocre at best. However, it seems that every time a type of film is released, a second must be about the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with trivial special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who played us, even if they weren't great, it was the film itself, the director, the special effects, the whole plot was too strange to play. A series of tornadoes hits a city and at the bottom of the film is about people trying to find family and friends and to deal with the damage. <br /> <br /> I don't really know why it seems that the duplicates of disaster films are released almost in sync with each other, but this would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
