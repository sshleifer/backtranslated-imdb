Van Dien must shudder with embarrassment at the memory of this ridiculously poor film, as indeed every single individual involved. To be honest, I'm rather embarrassed to admit having seen it from start to finish. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original "Crossroads" series and "Prisoner Cell Block H". Most five-year-olds would be able to propose a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. As for the recitations, if you can imagine the most garbage porn you've ever seen - one of those where the action is completed by an interminable "story" to explain how an old peroxide blonde boiler got spit-red a couple of guys with mustaches - you'll get an idea of ​​the acting standard in 'Maiden Voyage'. Worse, you can't even go fast to the sex scenes, because there aren't any. A terribly scary movie.
