The way viewers react to this new "adaptation" of Shirley Jackson's book, which was promoted as NOT a remake of the original 1963 film (quite true), will be based, I suspect, on the following: those who were great fans of both the original book or film will not think much about this ... and those who have never been exposed to anyone, and who are big fans of Hollywood's current trend towards "special effects" which are the first and the first last word on how "good" a film is, it will love it. <br /> <br /> Things I didn't like about this adaptation: <br /> <br /> 1. It was NOT a true adaptation of the book. From the articles I had read, this film should have covered other aspects of the book that the first one never had around. And, it seemed reasonable, no movie can cover a book word for word unless it's the length of THE STAND! (And not even then) But, there were things in this film that were never mentioned or even mentioned in the film. It reminded me of how they decided to kill the black man in the original version of THE SHINING. I didn't like that either. What the film press release should have said was ... "We took the basic, very simple idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same house names and several (though not all) the names of the protagonists, but then we decided to write our story, and, what the heck, we looked at THE CHANGELING and THE SHINING and GHOST first and decided to add some of them. "<br /> <br /> 2. They have completely lost the theme of a parapisicologist who invited the carefully selected guest who had all the brushes with the paranormal in their past, to investigate a house that really seemed to be "born bad". No, instead, this "doctor" brought everyone home with the false pretense of studying their "insomnia" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear ... like laboratory rats , Who mentioned he was never told that it is part of an experiment ... good boy). By the way, this doctor, who did not have the same name, was different from the dedicated professional of the original film as night after day. <br /> <br /> 3. In direct contrast to the statement used to promote both films, "some houses have just been born bad", this house was not born bad but has become quite bad due to what happened there ... and this time, Nel comes to unravel the mystery (nuances of THE CHANGELING). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that I'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the public ... but, therefore, there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad TO START WITH. She is the first "victim" to die before having ever seen her. <br /> <br /> 4. The way Luke's character was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. He had to be a casual playboy who would one day be able to inherit the house (and he was a true skeptic of his "story") ... and in this he was just a nerd muttered by the enological voice that he couldn't sleep (remember the insomnia) and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. It also bothered me how the film jumped from the attempt to almost recreate the original scenes word by word (the scene with Nel's sister's family and the little opening speech of the Mrs. Dudley ...) to go on fancy flights that made me think more of these other THE HAUNTING films. It is as if he could not decide what he wanted to do. <br /> <br /> 6. I lost the narrative of Nel throughout the film. The original was so similar to a gothic novel in the way the story was told primarily in the first person, through the eyes of Nel, and we were always aware of his thoughts. That totally unique touch has been completely lost in the new version. They also tried to make Nel much more than a heroine. The original Nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could it have been otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) And she liked to moan, and she lost her patience. .. This was almost too good to be true. This has never been more evident than in the climax of the film in which the writer had obviously watched GHOST too many times. <br /> <br /> 7. They have changed the history of the house and occupy too much. There was no Abigail Crain (Hugh's daughter whose legend appeared large in the original versions), there was no "companion" and there was no nursery school. There was not even "Grace" (wife of the original doctor) and the wives of Hugh Crain died in completely different ways. These changes have changed history too. I don't know if the producers of this film should be happy that Shirley Jackson does not walk on this earth anymore or if they should ... WE ARE SORRY (if you understand what you think !!!) The ghosts that you imagine are not something to be joked with! !!). <br /> <br /> In conclusion, let me just leave you some words of the original Luke (appropriate replacement of the word "home" for "film"!): "This 'film' should be burned to the ground, and the ground strewn with salt! "My favorite movie of all time remains like this. No competition from this.
