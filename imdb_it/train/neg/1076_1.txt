This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so many problems remembering his accent that he was unable to express his lines. The plot was absolutely not worthy of the name of John Grisham. No wonder it was never published as a book or published in theaters. I didn't even look at it all. I decided I didn't care who did it, then I realized there was nothing to do with "whodunit"!
