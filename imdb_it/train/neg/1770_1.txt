Both my wife and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever made. Certainly in the top ten of those I've seen to the end. At least "Plan 9" was pleasant. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed "Christine", "The Dead Zone", "Firestarter", "Carrie" and some of his other films. I didn't care much about "Cujo" (just because the sound was so bad in the versions I've seen and I often couldn't tell what people were saying), or "Pet Sematary (Pet Cemetery)". <Br /> <br /> But this mess was a total mistake in every way possible. The "creatures" seemed designed by a 9-year-old child. (No offense for 9-year-olds.) <br /> <br /> Even the "one-liners" made us moan and weren't nearly funny.
