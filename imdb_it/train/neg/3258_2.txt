DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Terrible and terrible film ... based on the pulp magazine / paperback series by Lester Dent / Kenneth Robeson ... on a superhero hero of the adventure of the 1930s and its five assistants, all experts in a field of activity that allows them to fight evil. It was a nice series of hockey ... but I enjoy reading a bit when I was a teenager. I knew they had made a film version in the 1970s, with Ron (Tarzan) Ely ... but I never had the chance to see it. He never played in the theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I've finally seen the movie, I can see why. The plot and the characters are never treated seriously ... it's all a kind of ironic and encamped ... a bit like the old Batman TV series ... only without the advantage of being funny ... or having flair . Messy dialogues, special cheese effects, stupid stereotypes, shoddy action scenes and bad, bad recitations. Actually, I find it fascinating in its wickedness ... what could they have thought? It was said that Arnold Schwarzenegger is acting in a modern-day remake ... but I don't imagine it would have been much better.
