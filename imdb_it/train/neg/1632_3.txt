An apparent project of vanity for Karin Mani (who?), Like a bizarre Charles Bronson who goes around sweeping away the "scum" that robbed his parents, or grandparents or something, and impressing young people with his karate skill. In a pivotal scene he intervenes to stop a rape and a crook launches his prison in jail, so after a couple of fresh shower scenes and some abortive prison seduction, he must take the law in his hands bla bla bla. I guess there's a lot of movies like this? The script is more stupid than usual if you can believe it. Mani stands out for the type of showbiz that would co-produce its starring role in the movie Death Wish, and I find that type sporadically captivating, but the film is a graceless apparatus. The competent actors would be wasted in the scumbag roles here, and would actively threaten the fantastic incompetent DA and a judge who must be the producer's uncle.
