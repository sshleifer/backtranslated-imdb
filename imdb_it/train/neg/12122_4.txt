Since the final of the billiard world championship ended prematurely and disappointing with Ronnie O`Sullivan who beat Greame Dott by 18 frames for 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their program and therefore decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely nothing I knew <br /> <br /> I lost a few seconds of the credits so I had no idea Viggo Mortensen starred us and I thought it could be a cheap TVM, surely l opening with the mawkish Pearl and Marty who took their kids in a summer camp have that kind of TV atmosphere, even though the bright (too-lit) cinematography seemed to suggest that it was a motion picture film and it wasn't until the appearance of Viggo Mortensen as a hippy Walker boy that I realized this was a film version, after all someone of Mortensen's stature would not have been the protagonist of a TVM, I mean it's like u a legend like Robert De Niro who appears in a film directed at the video. Wait a minute, no Bob ....? <br /> <br /> Some people on this site have said that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing couple on screen and I agree. I can understand why Pearl would have been attracted by the exciting hippy guy, but she has no idea why Walker would have been attracted to the wife of the house. The 1960s were ahead of my time, but surely if you can choose between hippy chicks and bored wives, it's not a choice at all. Keep in mind that many people took LSD in those days so I think this explains it <br /> <br /> I feel that the main problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes down to the fact that it is a romantic drama in the heart ( Just how you would expect in a TVM) with lots of teasing scenes of maturity so why include a fairly explicit sex scene? It is a jar with the rest of the film and maybe not suitable for menopause women who were 20 years old in 1969. I say perhaps because the film also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the scenes of the formation of the age of majority and probably the adolescents will be bored by the historical and social context of the man walking on the moon and Woodstock. In other words, A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audiences, but probably none of them will like it
