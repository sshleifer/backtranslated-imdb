As often happens, the awesome and explosive trailers of Asian films do nothing but lackluster stories. Similar to Unleashed (which was great) Dog Dog Bite tells a story in which men are bred like ferocious wild dogs that execute their master's offerings. The main characters, an emotionally underdeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable cop, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. In fact, in the end, you lose track of who you should empathize with, unable to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the two men ?? whether this was the director's failure or perhaps the underscore message he was trying to say is up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Even if the beginning of the film was full of intrigue and unpredictability, from the middle - in a sense it slipped into a banal story of survival and revenge. The suspense, evident at the beginning, soon faded due to a roughly inhomogeneous soundtrack that undermined the potentially effective narrative. And in the end, you had the feeling that all the basic background information and introspection of the main characters were somehow very useless. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, was the transition in history from point a to b quite atypical compared to American films? so those who are not familiar with Asian films and are tired of Hollywood predictability should check it out. <br /> <br /> The white balance seemed to be off for most of the film. It was like looking at a picture taken with fluorescent when it had to be set to tungsten. Maybe I'm the only one, but he strained his eyes. <br /> <br /> Did you like the movie playing tricks too? an interesting accumulation gave me hope for the slow-moving story until it was diverted to a low-budget, low-speed chase scene. And just when you think you have an unanswered indie ending in a mix of Shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it is not an ending at all, but rather a transition into a magician assembling country music on peace and serenity. > <br /> Throw in some horrible scene of suffocation, an unexpectedly ferocious moment of redemption and vice versa, the fascination of Asians for body fluids and a horrible soundtrack that did not correspond to the film, and get the mediocre Asian thriller. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why every fight scene was superimposed on clips of roaring lions, I thought they should symbolize dogs? In the end, in the end, does a real murderer come to mind who still hides among us? tetanus. <br /> <br /> 4/10
