Despite being the sequel to the most powerful original, this is more of a comic remake of the 13th Friday concerning the further antics of the psychopath Angela, killing more maiden boys for their "immorality" in a field. <br /> <br /> Pamela Springsteen (Bruce's sister) looks great. There are some damn sex scenes with some attractive girls, but the film is so (unintentionally) comic rather than suspenseful, it's a stinker. <br /> <br /> * of ****. <Br /> <br /> MPAA: Rated R for graphic violence and gore, nudity and for some sexuality, language and drug use.
