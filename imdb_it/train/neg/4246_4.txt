Anne Bancroft plays Estelle, a dying Jewish mother who asks her devoted son (Ron Silver) to locate the lonely movie star Greta Garbo and present the two before Estelle finally leaves. "Bancroft Talks" could be titled while the actress assaults this uncertain comic / dramatic / sentimental material for its duration. Sidney Lumet, the cold or hot director, can't get a steady rhythm, and Bancroft's constant overacting is not in the least reduced by the director, but keeps her in the front row: pretty, with eyes full of tears and with tears to the eyes. Estelle becomes an obstacle in this scenario (not that the subtly conceived plot has much to do). The silver and the co-stars Carrie Fisher and Catherine Hicks end up with very little to do but support the star, and everyone is trampled by its chime. * 1/2 from ****
