That song keeps buzzing in my head. It's not the most beautiful song, but it's the 80s. This film is about a singer who "supposedly" is killed while being charged with murder while chasing his girlfriend who sings the backup voices in his band. The singer named Billy "Eye" (yes, right) died after two years and his band returns for a concert only this time the backup singer is the lead singer. Billy pursues her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrorizing the girl and making sure that the people around her think that there is something wrong with her and that he is imagining things. Eventually he decides to go to a cemetery and dig into his grave to see if it's still there. He sees that he is dead but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film we discover the reason behind all this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to return to him blame his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrify her because she called him crazy. The finish is very cheeky and the acting is very lame and in wood. But ... I like it anyway. I watch it for the song. I wish I had it
