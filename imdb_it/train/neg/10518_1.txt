Oh boy, where do I go with this? A wonderful acting, a weak plot, stupid deaths, useless nudity ... <br /> <br /> This is not entertainment ... this is hell. <br /> <br /> Hell. <br /> <br /> Do not waste money, time or life in this pit of evil. <br /> <br /> It's just ... damn it, this movie is horrible! Tom Savini, WHY?! Why should you waste your life on this shit? This film is not worth it. I'd rather snort and bang my head against a wall than watch THIS ... this sinful act again! <br /> <br /> Please, follow my advice and stay f # @ k away from this asshole of an elephant movie. No, you know what? I shouldn't even call this a movie! Just stay away!
