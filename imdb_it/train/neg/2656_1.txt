(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /> <br /> Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to see him tonight. I had to turn it off before the second hour, because I found myself absolutely without sympathy for his daughter or mother. Both turned out to be self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter adding up in a rough, disrespectful and rash manner to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was "At least we won't have to look at her anymore". Keaton did a good job moving in his dazed and painful state, but by now it was too far for me. I just didn't like it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to be interested in the protagonist, you have to make me worry about the characters much earlier - if it's almost an hour and I don't care, it's too late. <br /> <br /> the cast was sincere and well played - I felt for * them! * - and the best gay friend was wonderful, but also combined, it wasn't enough to bring the film for me.
