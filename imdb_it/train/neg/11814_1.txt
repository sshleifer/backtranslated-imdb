Later in the day, I remembered seeing stupid Nintendo Power comics that had the same artwork as this show ... and it turned out that this show would come on a television near me! I wasn't ecstatic, but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show would have been. All my friends said that this show had no real meaning and was too silly for heterosexual people like me (I'm actually gay), so I decided to watch the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First of all, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate the way so many fans show off Tiff, it's sad. I also hate the way the chef Kalasaki (or whatever the non -strax name was) made a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a losing adviser to King Dedede (who sucks on this show) and I hate the face of that one company that continues to supply Dedede with those horrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> Then I started to hate Kirby even more since it was obvious that Nintendo was only sorry to get some popularity from Kirby. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coldness, and Kirby will be nothing but a small snort of homosexuality. NUF SAID !!!
