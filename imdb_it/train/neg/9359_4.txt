This film is probably pro-Islamization. <br /> <br /> Why do I write it? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. At the end of the film he looks like a Muslim because of his dress, which has kept his amulet and his general clothing. He has a six-year-old boy, who wears the same jacket and is therefore probably Muslim, although his mother is Christian. The main character then chooses, it seems, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. None of the other male main characters, who are Christians, seem to raise a child. There are more Muslims in the world than this movie at the end of it, so it seems.
