What an ugly, bad movie! I tried to watch without fast forwarding ... That failed. After about 30 minutes I stopped the movie, I went online to see how many minutes this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) It was a confusing and boring film. I don't think anyone can be beaten by hitting a fluorescent light bulb much less gutted by one !! The only funny thing is that I saw the "The Killer Cut" version of the movie. The box boldly states "More Blood!" "More sex!" "More terror than the theatrical version!" Yikes! If this movie was horrible with all those claims, I wonder how lame "UN-Killer Cut" was ??? If you want to see a great movie about the world of the living and the world of the dead, watch the series of The Night of the Living Dead !!
