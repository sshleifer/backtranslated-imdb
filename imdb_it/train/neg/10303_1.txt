*** Comments contain spoilers *** I was barely waiting for this show as a TV appointment when they started the annoying music under EVERY SCENE, when Don Epps had an average of almost one shot per case, when the very nasal Diane Farr she was obviously pregnant (but we didn't have to notice it) and when Colby was a ***** g TRIPLE agent. But now, in the episode tonight, David is trapped with a paranoid, crazy job who is an OBVIOUS amateur with a gun, in an elevator and ... HE CANNOT DISARM IT. An experienced and trained field agent, who was the first to enter many times and is an expert in hand-to-hand combat, CANNOT FIND A DICE WORK. Not when the aforementioned die job flashes, looks away, drops the head, closes the eyes; not even when she looks at the fiber optic thread that twists on the ceiling like a stripper on a pole for 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then came the scene that made me realize how much I enjoy learning from the chubby, frivolous but very charming Charles Epps and his sexy mate / love interest Amita, my Friday night will be better spent otherwise engaged . Don gives David the "rescue word" which is the code "The s ** t is about to come down"; David is ready, they kill the lights, they leave the elevator, they make the die work jump and ....... <br /> <br /> David CANNOT DISARM TO DISCARD / KILL / BEAT IN SUBMISSION THE DICE WORK. The villain ends with BOTH GUNS, David ends SHOT. <br /> <br /> I'm done. I hope NUMB3RS is fun.
