I went to see it in the hope of some good old Alice Entertainment. Once I realized that I wouldn't understand it, I saw it for a well-made film (in terms of footage, and yes ... it was). But apart from the fact that he has a good cinematographic quality, considering that I was watching grainy movies all day, there was nothing good about that movie. <br /> <br /> Killed 42.Why did Tweedle Dee and Dum play Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer this for me? Who can answer something horrible about this movie for me. <br /> <br /> I agree with those who said it was just a long and long joke for the staff. That is all it seemed to be. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr.Carroll. I'm so sorry that someone did it to his fabulous stories.
