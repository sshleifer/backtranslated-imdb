As kindly as possible, I sincerely believe that this film is a waste of time. I didn't find the film 'hot, emotionally satisfying' of others. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the movie. The story was subtle, the characters were distorted and the pedestrian direction. <br /> <br /> Fooey. <br /> <br /> Now I will write a little more about this film, so I do the 10th minimum line. There is not much else to say and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimum, so here it is. <br /> <br /> A young boy who is greedy for new talent, he looks for time with aging, a bitter mentor despite his comic-strip father homophobia. The aged and bitter mentor finds himself drinking a lot and teaching very little. the conflict arises Although I don't think this is a spoiler, I added the warning in case someone believes that too much information is too much. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I found the film boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly don't understand what little confusion there is, especially on this site, about the transcendent quality of this film. I think it's really worth avoiding it. But, as Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
