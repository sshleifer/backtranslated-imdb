If I could give this film a real rating, it would probably be in negative numbers. While I respect the fact that someone must continue to make these terrible "horror" films, seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a waste of money that you could spend on something much more worthy of your time. <br /> <Despite being a horror movie, there is nothing scary about it, unless the idea of ​​seeing how many horror clichés you can put in a movie scares you. If the score had been higher, it would probably have been a better long-term movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who made this version of "Prom Night" was wrong. Probably the actors could have done a decent job if it hadn't been for questionable scripting. This was a terrible waste of a trip to the cinema. I'd rather go see "One Missed Call" again, at least this one has had some plot.
