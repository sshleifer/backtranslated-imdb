Actually I saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I gave my money to the cashier, he said two words I had never heard in a theater before or after: "No refund!" As soon as I heard those words, I would have to say goodbye to my money and go home. But no, foolishly, I went in and saw the movie. This film did NO ONE in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even inadvertently! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so someone was shouting "This movie sucks!" The audience will applaud with enthusiasm, then sit there in a dazed and bored silence for another ten minutes.
