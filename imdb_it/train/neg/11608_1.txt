If this guy can make a movie, then I can certainly make one myself. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you hire me to make a movie for you, I promise to do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) I will add other naked women. This film has not had any. I think class B horror movies are sold only because of their traditional exploitation of the female body. I would not let my spectators fall. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from doing too many scenes in which the hero wakes up to discover that it is only a dream. I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes. And, considering that the film lasted only an hour, the relationship between dream and feature film was quite high. And if I decide to make a sequence of dreams, I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes. I mean, who sleeps in leather pants ?? <br /> <br /> 3) don't rob me movies like Star Wars or Matrix because I'll know that my budget is small and I don't want to disguise disdain for big-budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references to them in mine. <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the undead. I mean, a palm pilot can only be so scary ... at least they turned him into a rude and pitiful monster before the screen exploded or something. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for the above qualities in your next horror production, count on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire.
