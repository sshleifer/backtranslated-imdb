That this poor excuse for an amateur showcase was announced at Sundance is a great example of what's wrong with most indie filmmakers these days. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is something like the art of cinematography. Collecting a 16mm camera and pointing it at those with a line is not a real movie. I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that the director didn't take someone's video camera ... <br /> <br /> Secondly, independent films should be about real people. There is nothing real in this film. None of the characters seem to be even remotely human. <br /> <br /> What they find are the fantasies of the imagination of a writer who tries to impress his friends by showing them how "fresh and edgy" they are. . <br /> <br /> Sorry, but it's not good writing, or good direction. <br /> <br /> What remains is a casing of a bad movie that somehow arrived at Sundance. Hard to believe that this was one of the best films presented ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it made me lose what remained of my respect for the Sundance brand.
