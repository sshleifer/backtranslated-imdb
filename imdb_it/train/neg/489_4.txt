The acting is good, the women are beautiful and the men are beautiful, so if you are looking for a well done soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you're wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the homonymous lead, is often a mystery. He could have told the truth - the truth presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and his lover would have been saved time in prison for a rape he had not committed. Was he protecting his father, who left halfway, when he impetuously instigated a malevolent cause? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly worried when her art seemed to matter first? During the process, this strong-willed woman turns before our eyes. On the contrary, his lover, who begins as a narcissistic cretin, becomes a selfless hero during the process. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love. Of course, since no good deed should go unpunished, we are told that he never sees it again.
