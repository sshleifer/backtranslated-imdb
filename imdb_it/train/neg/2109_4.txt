I find a coffin much more comfortable than a bed. <br /> <br /> Interesting vehicle of Bela Lugosi (Glen or Glenda, Dracula) in which he plays the mad scientist. I was particularly scared when he appeared in his guests' bedrooms when they were sleeping. <br /> <br /> Luana Walters (Girls in Prison) was really attractive as a sensual reporter, Patricia Hunter <who was supposed to be a victim, but the power of the woman always exceeds the evil scientist. <br /> <br /> 2'11 "Angelo Rossitto and the gruesome Frank Moran, who liked to style women's hair added to the film. <br /> <br /> Interesting to watch a horror movie from the 1940s.
