"Piece is Cake" is a defeatist and revisionist story of the worst kind, whose only point is to savage the reputation of the pilots (admittedly fictitious) it portrays. He left a bad taste in his mouth. <br /> <br /> In March 1989 "Airplane Monthly", Roland Beamont wrote a pungent condemnation of the way the RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV miniseries. Some of his comments deserve to be repeated: <br /> <br /> "There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons I saw in action, and a total absence of the semblance portrayed in" Piece of Pie ". It wouldn't have been tolerated for a moment ... ... The prevailing atmosphere was more like that of a good rugby club, even if with more discipline, nor was there any sense of" death or glory " . the training had insisted that we were there to defend this country, and now we have been asked to do it - neither more nor less. <br /> <br /> "There was no discussion about" courage "or "cowardice". People either had guts or not - but mostly they did. But we knew fear, we recognized it in ourselves and in each other, made our damned will to control it, and then went on with the work ... <br /> <br /> " ... I didn't feel any "glory", but there was a sense of greatness, and none of this had the slightest resemblance to "Piece of Cake". <br /> <br /> Beamont was, in his own words , "a fighter pilot who, unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series, was there at that time". <br /> <br /> Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and at the BoB, before becoming one of the best exponents of both Typhoon and Tempest and a post-war pilot test. <br /> <br /> "Piece of Cake" is an absolute and total distortion of the way Fighter Command pilots acted in that moment is nothing less than complete and utter shame ...
