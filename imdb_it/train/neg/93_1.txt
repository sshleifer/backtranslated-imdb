A woman asks for advice on the way to reach a mysterious city and listens to two macabre stories about the local freak, both linked to the zombie. But perhaps fate has something bad in store for her ... <br /> <br /> The Zombie Chronicles is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Indeed, I must confess, so much was it that I made rapid progress through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of this, believe me. It works for only 69 minutes, and there are still tons of filler. You have skinheads who do a lot of pushups, lots of sloppy and kissing scenes between goofy teens (rhyming, tee hee) and some great examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> As for the characters in the title, they barely have a footnote in the film. Because, in the introduction you get more dead action than the previous one! However, considering how pathetic the eyes that come out of the eye socket and the consumption of brain sequences are (among other "delights"), perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to top it all off, it seems I like it was shot on someone's cell phone to be broadcast on Youtube. Work from a snappy machine, scratches on the press, flickering lights ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001, and not in 1971. Even the clothes and clothes seem to be about thirty not up to date! > <br /> If you think you're not qualified to do a Chronicles review because you haven't seen the entire movie, then go ahead. Try to sit through, I guess you won't even make the first appearance of blue-smartie colored monsters before you apologize and leave. It's really ridiculous that someone chose to release it, and honestly you'll have a lot more fun resting your drink on the record than torturing your DVD player with this gigantic excuse for horror. In fact, don't be surprised if you pack up your bags and leaves in the morning, leaving yourself doomed to watch VHS tapes for the rest of your life. Have you been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> P.S What kind of horror in 18 years has the woman in a big sports bra during the mandatory sex scene ?! See, the movie can't even get that part right ...
