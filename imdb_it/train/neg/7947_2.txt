When I saw this movie on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it wasn't. I have no idea how this film could be presented on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> Acting is wonderful for all actors. I hated history. History was stupid. The film begins with a man holding a scroll with a sign stamped on it. It breaks the seal and certain disasters occur. Water turns into blood, the oceans become extinct, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> Even the female character was annoying. Many of the things he did didn't make sense. Like when you see a piece of paper with a date. Coincidentally, it is the date on which it is expected to give birth to her baby and she starts puzzling and starts researching and asks religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler warning * <br /> <The two worst things that happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God had told him to kill his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it. br /> <br /> Here's what happens. The person with mental retardation is hit and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the middle of a huge earthquake and gives birth to her baby. He touches the head of his child, transferring his soul into the child and then dies. So the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change of heart? Become furious when the Governor grants the execution of a mentally retarded man, then is it all about forgiveness once a single woman transfers her soul to her child? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The film is rather stupid. It is another religious piece of world propaganda. The acting of Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and all the others is excellent. This is all there is. <br /> <br /> Give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good acting with a lot of nonsense!
