This version of "Moby Dick" insults the public by claiming that it is based on the novel by Melville, even going so far as to show a fake phrase from the first chapter rather than the famous "Call me Ishmael". Besides having an atrocious acting, even by John Barrymore, this is perhaps the greatest example of how Hollywood (especially the first Hollywood) would go to review and change a famous novel just to increase its box office possibilities. the beautiful poetic language of the novel has been completely eradicated, and Ahab has been transformed from a gloomy, blasphemous and obsessive madman to a rude and misunderstood hero who just wants to kill Moby Dick after his boyfriend (!) turns away from him after saw his wood leg. Added to this is the bad standard brother who wants the boyfriend for himself, and a different ending!
