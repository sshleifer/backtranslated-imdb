The story goes like this, Netflix sent me my DVDs late and so I went to the analog rental place known as "Blockbuster Video". They suck you. Really bad, they have 150 copies of the last lame movies for your pleasure to see, but I don't want to see any. So I saw BTK Killer on the shelf, all for his solitary ego. I like watching movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I'll never understand, so I want to see that kind of thing. Anyway I insert this dvd and all of a sudden from the first second, it sucks. I'm sitting there with my b.f. and we are like "what is this kind of crap?" Unsteady chamber operation, horrible acting, - the first scene in which a woman is killed, you wonder if she would rather quietly talk to him quietly, Then a mouse thrusts itself into its throat. I really wonder if the director has an erection for this shit. There is nothing decent in this "film". All I have to say to the director is "do you have a crazy tripod?" Every blow was brutally unstable. The music was terrible. It was as if they had decided one day to make a movie. They were probably gathering people from WalMart to introduce themselves and "act" for them. Simply horrible. If you make a film like this, directing is your hobby, NOT what you should do to live. You shouldn't go to DVD releases for movie fans like me. Better leave yourself at home for your friends when you have a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with .... Then have your BTK KIller movie come out and say "Do you want to see this lousy movie I did once?"
