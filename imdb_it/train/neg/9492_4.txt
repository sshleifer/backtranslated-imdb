A star for the "plot". A star for acting. A star for American dubbing with a shrill voice. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity to take off all their clothes. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before she did "Manon des sources". Béart undresses even a couple of times, but even her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. Pay attention to the scene in which he tells his friend the three "first times" for a girl. It is banal, but still more erotic than the rather ridiculous and choreographed "love scenes" by Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Incidentally, cinematography is not exceptional; the stills for the end credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
