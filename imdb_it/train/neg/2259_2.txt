For the life of me, I can't understand why they would like to make a film on the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incredibly trash. Some ways, unfortunately, is a guilty pleasure. We have to admit we have seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw it recently in the United States. It's pretty ugly. I'll admit it. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant to play. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is inside. She is playing herself basically. All he needed was his lover boy, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just look at the "Jerry Springer Show". It's more fun than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
