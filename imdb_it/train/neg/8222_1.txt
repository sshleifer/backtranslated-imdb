Um ... Ok, I guess I have the whole shaking cam, the gorilla-style shooting technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie ... This thing was just a complete mess from the start. Bad acting, bad direction, bad history and horrible cinematography. As this piece of garbage was released, I'll never know, but it has and unfortunately I saw it. Filmed on location in Tennessee by director Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen (Harry and Lloyd), "Five Across The Eyes" I assume should look like a "Blair Witch" movie but it's not up to ... dives from a cliff. Actually I was embarrassed for these young women, I'm sure Hollywood stars were promised, but they ended up in this dunghill. Dialogue is ridiculous and actually aggravates you while you listen to it. How this should be a horror movie is another mystery, as there is nothing remotely scary about it, except that I saw it ... Try this for size: Is there 5 of you and 1 of her, do the math and beat your ass ... "The End". Honestly it went on (and on) for another 95 minutes of amazing stupidity ... <br /> <br /> I saw it for free and wanted my money back.
