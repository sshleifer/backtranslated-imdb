Unfortunately, Marry Harron has decided to make a fictitious account of Bettie Page's life to get on with her problems with men. As is typical in all his works, each male character is portrayed as weak, clumsy or twisted. To add to her fiction, she designs ideas and problems that are not true, according to Bettie Page herself. Bettie did not abandon the world of work because she thought he was morally wrong or had religious problems (although she had become reborn later in life, thanks to the influence of her third husband, a minister). She left him, because she was about thirty, her acting career had not gone anywhere and she felt that she was losing her appearance. The hints of harassment and rape are invalidated and denied in the same words as Bettie and are the director's attempts to state that any woman who did what Bettie did must have been victimized by men. Harron fails to point out that Bettie designed her clothes in almost all of her shots (they weren't given to her by "sick" fetishists). Harron also disagrees with the fact that Bunny Yeager, who made many famous Bettie photo shoots, also did many "naughty" shots with Bettie and was not the morally honest and professional photographer portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that saves is that Gretchen Mol looks a lot like Bettie. Otherwise, there are other more accurate and honest films and documentaries for his life and for the people inside.
