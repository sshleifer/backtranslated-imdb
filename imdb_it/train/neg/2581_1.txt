First of all, to take away my personal feelings, let me say that I hate the so-called comedies in which every single character is written and interpreted in such a stupid way as to hurt if they are all the result of consanguinity. /> <br /> Now I will say this that I saw the first three American Pie films and while they were not the most incredible films I had ever seen they were in place (and real masterpieces compared to the three "American" Pie Presents ", I I still feel compelled to ask what the hell they were thinking when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> I also have a few more questions. <br /> <br /> Who did I think this was an acceptable use of the studio funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> which approved the final script (and what did that person smoke when he approved it)? <br /> <br /> And finally why did anyone think he deserved be released in rooms where the average admission cost is between $ 10 and $ 15 depending on where you live when you should have gone directly to the discount basket at Blockbuster or Wal Mart? <br /> <br /> There is so much wrong in this film I can't write a really complete review because it would exceed the words maximum allowed on this forum so I'll just touch on the biggest things wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is generic, uninspired and stupid and the characters are as interesting as looking at the dry paint for eighty minutes, but the biggest thing I can see wrong with this film is acting. <br /> <br /> While most of the cast has no talent, there are no names that will probably be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> the only big name in this film is Eugene Levy who he spends most of his time on the screen with this smirk on his face that tells the viewer "I know this isn't I'm funny and I'm wasting my talents but hey they pay me for it, so who cares" doesn't even look to make one of his jokes fun (he really deserves better than this junk). <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the rest of the cast is horrible even though some of them have been on some really great TV shows, Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back) plays a character that is so unbearable and irritating (there are things that could teach tropical skin diseases) that almost would like to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) hangs on the screen and wastes what talent has to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next film in this series will be just a soft core porn with a storyline so they can get around the MPAA and get an evaluation of this movie goes off with unnecessary vulgarity of nudity and unnecessary sexual content offensives that should have scored X (the rating board must have been drunk or drugged when reviewing this film for his judgment). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that twenty-five years ago when Wes Craven presented A Nightmare On Elm Street at the MPAA for a rating review, they forced him to cut twenty-five seconds of footage (I think it was part of a death scene who had a silicone cast of a breast in it) to avoid getting an X score and had no choice but to do it or the movie would not be released, <br /> <br /> but this kind of uselessly offensive garbage can get the R rating today because it's all done in the name of comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror movie with this kind of content there would have been a huge stench on the content and it would have had the feared X rating. <br /> <br /> The last thing that really annoys me is writing, this film was written to sound like the wet dream of a twelve year old boy with an extremely hyperactive sexual imagination is rather youthful and extraordinarily crass , almost every exhibition situation that should move the corpse in this film the plot is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it arrive a mile away and the so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotyping stereotypes, no matter the often repugnant sexual references constant and unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior seems to have been written by some incompetent first-year hacks in a low-rent film school writing class. <br /> <br /> the long and short time to kill this series before it becomes more stupid crass and offensive, this cake is full of street apples.
