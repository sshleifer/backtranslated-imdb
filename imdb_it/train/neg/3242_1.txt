Here's a review for people like me. This film sucks from start to finish. I threw popcorn on the screen and tried to entertain myself at the MSF2000. The plot depends on random events and relies on the stupidity of people who should be smart. Lead falls in love with a scammer and it doesn't occur to her that she could be scammed ????? And she is rich ???? And you are a famous psychologist ????? Come on people. Enter the bar at the most convenient time when everyone is gathered to talk about cheating her ??? It was so dramatic that it seemed like a slap in the face to even half-obtuse movie viewers. The rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet's dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat eaters, war hors d'oeuvres and pellet makers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I try. That shouldn't seem real, that's fine. I don't care. Everyone talks about the SAME. Mamet cannot create characters; all he can do is empty his voice about us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder its actors are so wooden. They are confused that everyone is the same character. (However, his subsequent films improve).
