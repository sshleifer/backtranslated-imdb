I really hope that Concorde / New Horizons isn't trying to make a serious horror film, or even an action movie when they made Carnosaur 3. The film is absolutely silly from start to finish. Even the humor in C3 is fun because it's bad. Definitely a high water mark in the genre "So Bad it's Good". If you like the worst of the worst, this is for you.
