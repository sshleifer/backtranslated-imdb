* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I am sure that when it was released in 1958 it was very appropriate for its time. Then the films were slower to allow the public to follow and analyze the story. Here a man moves into a house owned by his last wife who mysteriously died with his new wife. The gardener Mickey (played by Alex Nicol, who also directed the film) is really an underrated character. He gets a skull to indirectly warn Jenni to be in trouble, since he knew there was a drama in the death of his first wife. He can't tell Jenni directly what happened, so try scaring her with the skull. Even Jenni, we discovered, saw his parents die, thus causing a life of mental anguish that leads to institutionalization. Like many viewers today, I found the rhythm of being a little too slow for my taste. But if you like horror at a slow pace without a lot of cold blood, this movie is for you. <br /> <br />
