This piece of shit may have been acclaimed 60 years ago, but it's one of the most racist films ever made with Native American Indians played by white men. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a great racist in real life, just like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971 Stewart had the actor Hal Williams fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series that mercifully failed) just because Williams was black. As if that wasn't bad enough, this movie is very old and boring. Look at "Dances with the wolves" instead for a less racist vision. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in his forties when this terrible film was made, and even with his ridiculous wig he still looked like a pedophile chasing after 16 years -old Debra Paget. I'm surprised it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
