This must be one of the best overrated anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown the "End of Evangelion" and this still made me hate even more. Not to mention the countless scams of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not mind the psychological and philosophical upheavals, but Evangelion drags him into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Besides that, most of the others were a group of whimpering whiners. They need to go to a psychiatric center, not to fly giant robots against the aliens called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even the mecha and the fights with aliens didn't help at all. It goes something like this: <br /> <br /> "Well, there are these robots, and they are really fantastic because they bleed (!) When they get hurt, but they are not really mecha, but angels caught, so sometimes they go crazy and they don't do what the underage pilots want, and they have to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. For those who really love this series, well you have the right to this opinion, I respect you. But to those who have a "crazy" obsession to think that everyone will like this series, you are more than an egoist. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run-Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
