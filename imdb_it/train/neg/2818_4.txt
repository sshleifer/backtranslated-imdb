Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit his hypocritical archaeologist father who mentions the Bible (William Finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in the flashbacks, railing in his cell. Genie is misled by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who rides naked on a horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoke, which leads to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman who simulates oral sex on a snake, an orgy and his father preaching in the background! Meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, eradicate eyeballs and throats. When Genie infiltrates the drug in her tea, she imagines de Sade hanging from a cross, a woman painted in gold with a leafy g-string and bloody herself on a bed covered with snakes. It is all because it is the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love. <br /> <br /> This typically scruffy production of Harry Alan Towers is redundant, dreary and rather meaningless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and location work are all excellent and at least there's always something to do. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
