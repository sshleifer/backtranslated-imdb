I didn't expect much from this film, after the terrible "Life is a miracle". It turns out that this film is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / screenwriter is only joking with the audience: "let me see how much it can support the void (the public)". The dialogues are empty, ... the scenery is minimalist. In a few moments, photography is really beautiful. A few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's hard to laugh sincerely during this "comedy". I laughed at myself for being able to watch the movie until the end. If you manage to get yourself past the fiasco of this director, you will find a good performance of a few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and an excellent interpretation of Emir's son, Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In short: shame about such a great director! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make high quality films. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget theatrical film just-for-my-budget, with an arrogant attitude towards world trends and neglect of his old fans.
