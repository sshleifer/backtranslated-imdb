the writing of the journalists and the pressing and unforgivable press officer and the sobbing sobbing were an iron fist and a clich√© ridden. <br /> <br /> I can't blame the actors, but surely someone must have said "are you kidding? This episode had a press perspective and the police perspective, while the police perspective was fairly standard, the prospect and the characterization of the press has been exaggerated and in some cases unbelievably unbearable. <br /> <br /> I noticed that it was an HBO co-production, if so, perhaps the stereotypes of the bat could be explained in that light , <br /> <br /> I was completely worried during the press conference scene: it lacked credibility and did not sound remotely true 40 minutes into the first episode and I am still waiting for the suspense. <br /> <br /> Skip Five Daysthis: 2008/9 production with these characters is far better and more suspenseful even if the crime is exaggerated. <br /> <br /> This story has had unforgivable moments that can only be described as incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> For a press officer to start a press conference without a detective present to take press questions. <br /> <br /> so unbelievable it seemed like an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> I then started looking for journalists called "Scoops" and Perry White to make an appearance. <br /> <br /> I saw the 2009 hunter before "five days" arrived in Australia, not realizing that it was a prequel and I was looking forward to Bonneville and McTeer running again. <br /> <br /> Trembling head.
