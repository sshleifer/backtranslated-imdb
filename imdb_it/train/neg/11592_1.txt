I'm still trying to determine if the previous installment was worse than this, or vice versa. Since it has been almost fifteen years since I saw this film, the fact that I remember so little of it does not bode well. Maybe it's simply because I saw it only once or twice, but I doubt it. If there is something worth remembering about this movie, you can be sure that I would remember it. <br /> <br /> At the time this film was released, the franchise was still dying, so a lot of media coverage was assigned to it. It is never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations on the basis of the plot. One of these articles had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of adult humans, so he decides to chase Alice's unborn child. So far, so good, but this is the work of the writer or director to explain to the public. It should not be left to an unrelated publication. <br /> <br /> Making use of the curiosity given in the third part on Freddy's conception, one could almost expect the scenes that would have raised this joke from the "horror for children" category but alas, it didn't have to be. It goes to show the pure idiocy of the American rating system that a piece of B'harnique junk like this could get the same score as a really scary piece like the original. <br /> <br /> At this point, the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on how you look at it, Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a competent acting quotient. Or maybe she just seems competent compared to the rest of the cast. However, since her last role was in something called The All New Adventures by Chastity Blade, I doubt she really had anything else for her. Poor old Robert Englund has also been in better productions than the last fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Because box office returns were steadily declining, and not just for this franchise, at the time, I would have thought that the studios would have realized the castration of their films didn't make them more salable. In fact, this particular film, like its immediate predecessor, was so castrated that not only could it not attract a new audience, but both could alienate the main audience that originally supported the franchise. Despite this, the fifth part must have the merit of not having the luminous and luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at. <br /> <br /> I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part 5 one out of ten. Trying to appeal to everyone, or everyone's MPAA idea, he can appeal to anyone. Like parts two and four, it could be completely erased from continuity, and no one would notice the difference.
