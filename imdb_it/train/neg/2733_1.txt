I argued that I should check the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by any Scrub follower, it probably doesn't fall into the category of a spoiler. <br /> <br /> Show clips. Grrr. We all knew that friends were going down the tube when they started with the clip shows ... and five and a half years in Scrubs have gone and fallen into that hole. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the writers couldn't be bothered to write that week and they said "let's show other fun stuff". It did not work. <br /> <br /> To begin with, showing all the times people have fallen is no fun if taken out of context. It's not funny to see Todd hanging from his banana hammock unless we know WHY he's hanging from his banana hammock. Secondly, for what was to be a collection of JD's fantasies, one was Turk's dream, another was not his fantasy, although I don't remember which one. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We have seen all these things before. And the clip collection of people dancing? Why? It's not funny. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to admit that two of my favorite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation ... Dr. Cox realized that Ben died ... and JD told him how proud I am of him. <br /> <br /> But even seeing those moments didn't save the episode. The summary says it all. <br /> <br /> Worst episode ever. Bill Lawrence, PLEASE, don't let your show go the same way as Friends, keep it fresh, keep it fun ... or wrap it.
