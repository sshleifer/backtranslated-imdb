Watched this on DVD in the original language with English subtitles. Either the subtitling was very poor or the real dialogue doesn't make much history and doesn't give any development to the characters. There are many HK stars in this, but the film does not need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just ugly. Bright and colorful CG scenes are attractive for pure colors and brilliance, but can become overwhelming in a short time. If anything, it makes me think of a child's film with its relentless cg burst, fight scenes and crap plot. I'm sure I caught what happened in the movie, but the whole realization of the story was pretty bad.
