This film is weak, The cover of the cover says that the most difficult gang in the East LA and is really Santa Ana, James Cahill behaves like a queen of the locker that defeats all the tough in Chlo's tough band. It's fake, boring, mindless and shocked, I tried to get my money from the video store, this movie was so ugly. It was also on the homo-erotic tip, far from what the videotape proclaims. James Cahill should act in Gay Porno. James is in every scene, he can't act to save his life. The movie features Eva Longoria who is sexy but James can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! Sometimes I was watching Gay Porn and I was shocked by the whole movie. James clearly wants to be with men, but rather submits to his gay desires, beats gang members over and over again. His martial arts skills are at a minimum, some members of a real gang would take him and his weak skills and snatch a new one.
