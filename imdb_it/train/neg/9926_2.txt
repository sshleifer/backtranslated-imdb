I just saw the 30th Anniversary edition of Blazing Saddles, one of my all-time favorites !! The TV Pilot for Black Bart stunk. The plot was non-existent and the acting was not good. It was obviously an attempt to take advantage of the success of Blazing Saddles and there were TV shows that managed to take off big films, but this would never work. Considering that for so many years the TV would not even have played the noises of the farts when they have televised the film, it is inconceivable that they thought they could air a TV show with the word "N" around. On the other hand, I enjoyed seeing a lot of familiar faces !!! There were several actors / actresses that I recognized from other shows over the years. I had to write all the names and do some research. It was fun. I was discussing with my mother if Steve Landesberg was from Barney Miller or Mash. I won! :)
