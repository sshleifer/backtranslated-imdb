OK, I didn't have high expectations, but I couldn't imagine this movie going down deep. <br /> <br /> The plot, so to speak, involved a priest of an obscure 2-member order investigating the death of the founder of a Sin Eater order. The Sin Eater allows Catholics to obtain salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in the film with a lot of boredom. It doesn't matter that this doesn't make sense since a Baptist could give you salvation ... we'll go ahead. <br /> <br /> I will arrange the plot without giving much: the priest goes to Rome with his friend to invest. He brings with him a mentally ill (I'm not making it up) who shot him during a massacre and who loves him (not a lick of this BTW is explained), a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as cardinal. They arrive in Rome, they find some gruesome kids who do nothing in the film, they meet an anti-pope S & M bondage that the drunk Irishman knows (unexplained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, by the way, he is a bad boy then he has an industrial / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot winds around. Heath thrills with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater for a flyover and then something else happens and then (all out of the camera) the antipope falls and the movie ends. <br /> <br /> 1 now in the movie one really wonders if something has happened. In the end something has happened, but you can't be sure it's important and since most of the drama takes place before or after the movement or off-scren, you really feel cheated.
