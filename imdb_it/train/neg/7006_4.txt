Mark Hamill should have felt very embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, use a new kind of "force" to regain possession of his dream machine, a bright red Vette. It seems that another young man attacks the first half hour and makes a U-turn in the wrong direction. Script and direction work is done terribly, with few scenes you can hardly catch. You expect the same to happen, and you're also smelling the smell of the jumble of the late 1970s. Only an ex-newcomer like Annie Potts would have easily stolen the show and saved this poor movie from the bad repo! His impractical but pleasant personality retains your interest in good, and this is the best opportunity to see her in a bathing suit. Hurray for Annie! I'm sorry, Mark! I guess the Force wasn't with you this time.
