Battlestar Gallactica was so beautiful because he had tight writing, a fantastic look, excellent actors and interesting stories ... And yes, there were sexy men and women running in and out of the uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors who smoke a storm to give it "character". Open air sequences that spoil the feeling of being somewhere else (yes, that's a Ford Focus sitting in the background). A lot of teenage angst. MANY women wandering naked (but in the background, which I am sure will be cut for the series) and a symbolic view of some men in towels. None of the actors except Polly Walker caught my attention. At an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it would be over. <br /> <br /> So what exactly is it that should bring me back? Science fiction? It's terribly light on that. The actors? In addition to the fine turnaround of Polly Walker, there is not much to do here. There are not even "beauties" in the cast, except perhaps Esai, although for the younger set he is quite old, since he is over 25 years old. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard of Caprica and, unfortunately, I think I'm right. I predict a very short run as a series, unless they really pinned their pencils on SciFi and set to work to make it more than The OC on another planet.
