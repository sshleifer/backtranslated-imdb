Although there were funny moments, I thought the film was rather lame. The longer he ran, the worse. Once the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself looking at the magnificent outcrops rather than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters. <br /> <br /> The daughter's character was particularly inconsistent. First, he enters negotiations, then he discovers the truth and she dances. Then she came back again, then left them again. Then she came back again. There is no apparent motivation for any of his decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many lost possibilities. I must say that the images were much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently the people who liked Repo Man were inclined to appreciate this. Searchers 2.0 cannot compete with The Searchers.
