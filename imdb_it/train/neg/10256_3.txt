Your mind will not be satisfied by this budget no-thriller budget; but, please, who is the will? A young couple spends the true end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens disguised as people of the Church. <br /> <br /> A small themed themed outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and lack of style and panache of similarly pure 50s films. And it's not just this, but EOTW sounds like a hybrid not only on the day of judgment but also the convent creeps in. The villain of the film is a well-known character actor. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless slap seems to be a piece of exploitation of the convent, the genre that was significantly in the 1970s, which today looks so funny and antiquated. However, the convent's secret laboratory is a nasty piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; but the end of the world is not his pride at all!
