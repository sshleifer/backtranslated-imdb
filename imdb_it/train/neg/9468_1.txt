The only good thing about this dishonest disaster is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a student can't find humor in something that's free, it's hopeless. <br /> <br /> Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent, but disconcerting set (which is done in his own way) to market Volkswagon beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing but a blatant attempt to capitalize on the Grinch's previous success (which has his opponents, but I really enjoyed it). It is difficult not to endure this failure and to ask ourselves what better projects have been passed to finance it. <br /> <br /> Want a fun Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch.
