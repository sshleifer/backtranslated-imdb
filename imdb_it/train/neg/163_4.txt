The first part of the film was rather pleasant, but towards the end it became commonplace. Although Turturro is an actor that I generally like, his Luzhin often resembled a bad impression of Rain Man and the portrayal of genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying. Overall it seems that this film is trying to get tough and ends up looking pompous despite its mostly excellent performances.
