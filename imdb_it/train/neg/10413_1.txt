There is no reason to watch this movie. If you have won and an extreme amount of money and have spent your time discovering every pleasure of life and you have reached a point where, by chance, you are away and you have some time to kill (as would have happened ), take this movie from the video store (if you can find it AND endure the assistant who laughs at you, then ask for this movie. Be prepared, however, for the mind to be invaded by an extremely wooden acting by everyone (in fact the best acting was people who didn't say anything) Oliver Reed completes his great career by playing a drunken character, but wait until he forgets that there's a reason to watch this movie - Claudia Udy shows her chest! is another reason!
