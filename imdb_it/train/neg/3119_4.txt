Robin Williams did a nice performance in The Night Listener as did the other cast members. However, the film seems rushed and leaves too many outstanding points to be considered a "must see". I think the problem occurs because there is not a strong enough relationship established between the caller and Gabriel Noon (I had to write it this way, because IMDb wants to automatically correct the spelling for "None"). The film runs a little past 1:30 am and in the first 15 minutes, apparently, Noon starts his search for Pete Logande, the calling boy. <br /> <br /> This happens after talking to the mysterious caller about 3 or 4 times. The conversations are not too in-depth and consist mainly of how you are ... I am in the hospital ... because your boyfriend has moved ... etc. In the book, the child becomes almost a shrink and a vice of Noon pours and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy, when he discovers that the child disappears and thinks that it could be a joke. <br /> <br /> In the film, Noon becomes obsessed with finding Logande, but the audience is left to wonder why? Since there is not a strong enough link between Noon and the caller, why worry? Who cares if the caller doesn't exist? <br /> <br /> I know there is a difference between a book and a movie, but those phone calls and that relationship were essential to be seen on the screen, because they provide the basis for the rest of the film. Since it doesn't work, the film falls apart. <br /> <br /> This is surprising because of the work of Maupin, Tales of the City. When it was turned into a mini series, it worked beautifully.
