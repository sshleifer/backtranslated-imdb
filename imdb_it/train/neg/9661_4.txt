I mean acting is bad, but I think it was the direction that made it. I never thought much about Highlander (the director himself) but that could be blamed in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This, however, has no excuse. People are shot while coming out of the trenches with a man in front of him! Those kinds of mistakes, along with an unclear timeline, strange battle tactics, sub-par cuts and poor visual effects, make this movie a subtitle. <br /> <br /> So, like so many others have commented, all these American shit. The German general is practically frightened by his captured American private. Be ready to swallow a lot, even in small doses. <br /> <br /> To sum up, a war movie not horrible but still very comparable in all respects.
