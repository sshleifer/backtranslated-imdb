I saw this movie in a drive-in in 1959. Up until "Howard the Duck" I considered this the worst movie I had ever seen. This film has tried to combine all genres into one; comedy, horror, adolescent anxiety, and the hot rod that must have generated "My Mother, The Car". Perhaps he deserves a second look to see if it is an accurate reflection of his time.
