This is one of the worst films I've seen in recent years. Besides Cuba and Angie, acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely unlikely. The make-up is so ugly that it's worth mentioning. I mean, who ever thought of makeup in a contemporary film. Someone should tell the make-up artist and the PDO that you shouldn't really see it. The ending is a big disappointment - along the lines of "and then they realized that it was all a dream" <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or your money. You are better off setting the space for 2 hours.
