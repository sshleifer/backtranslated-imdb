Blonde and Blonder wasn't funny. Basically, it was a version of Dumb and Dumber, but less fun, and they used too much background noise and music. JOURNEY TOO MANY NOISE BACKGROUND AND MUSIC IF YOU ASK ME !!!! It begins immensely boring, and FULLY silly. It doesn't pick up anywhere early, and I felt more and more frustrated as they brought this nonsense. Perhaps the only thing that saved me from giving this movie 1 was the last 30 minutes. I found it a bit funny and interesting as it approached the end, but that was the only part. , I could not do without a bit like the characters of Pamela Anderson and Denise Richard. Although this film had no laughs from me, it caught my attention. I wouldn't say to completely avoid this movie, but there are thousands of better movies to spend your time and money on Blonde and Blonder.
