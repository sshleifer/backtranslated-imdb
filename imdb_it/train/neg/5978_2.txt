This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for smaller children to follow and too repetitive to entertain older children. The message of the film, about the relationship with the loss, is subverted by the return of the girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket offers fun, but they are not really part of the little storyline, so they don't appear very often.
