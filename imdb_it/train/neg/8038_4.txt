** SPOILERS ** Redicules slasher film that makes no sense with a killer running around dressed in a black tunic and wearing what looks like a rubber mask by Peter Lorre. At the beginning of the film, almost the very first scene, young Beth Morgan was in rehabilitation due to the intensive use of drugs after her boyfriend was murdered in Tennyson Collage about a year ago. <br /> <br /> The FBI agent is also taken out Agent Sacker (Jeff Conaway), who is obsessed with capturing the killer, his daughter was also killed at Tennyson at the same time. At a time when the movie "Want to know a secret" is over, it never explains what those two murders in Connecticute have to do with the massacre in Florida of half a dozen collage students a year later? other than the murderer, at least in the murder of Beth's boyfriend, he was wearing the same silly Halloween outfit. <br /> <br /> During the spring break in Sunshine state, the six students spend their holidays in a house by the sea and before you know it, they start being thrown down one at a time. Beginning with computer fanatic Brad Clyton, Chad Allen, the murder spills even into the city with a number of people who have nothing to do with the targeted student, including police chief Gavin, Jack McGee, who is being sliced . <br /> <br /> The masked assassin saves Beth for the last time in this strange ceremony in a deserted church, in what appear to be the Florida Everglades. Then he finally reveals who his is and what his intentions are that make as much sense as the film, no one. Trying to scare his audience, everything the film does is confusing and baffling with a series of slasher scenes that are not too convincing. The most effective with the victim Oz Washington, Tom Jay Jones, survive at least three attempts in his life and end up, together with Agent Sacker, the hero of the film. <br /> <br /> Oz also had a fierce cut due to a large shard of glass that almost cut him in half and paralyzed him, but later miraculously recovered, after being arrested for a murder that he did not commit, in fact he had him go twice with the murderer with him, not so much as having a slight limp in his path! Also, didn't it make any sense why Oz and Beth went alone to attack and capture the killer instead of calling the police, on a cell phone that had Oz instead? <br /> <br /> Beth's boyfriend, who loses his head for her, in the movie Hank Ford, Joseph Lawrence, is also very unconvincing as are the two girls at the beach house. Together with Beth Oz they end up being the victims of the killers and then somehow disappear from sight! for a moment you didn't know if they were actually killed or if it was some sort of hallucination in the part of Oz or the local police. Until the final off-the-wall scene where they sprang up in the church. <br /> <br /> We also have a vision of a previous relationship between Tina and Hank with her, drunk and hateful acting, trying to get it with Hank while Beth comes in without Hank and Tina noticing. He seemed to have disturbed Beth even after her boyfriend had been murdered at the beginning of the movie!
