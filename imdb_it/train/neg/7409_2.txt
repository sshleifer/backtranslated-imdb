There are some elements that save this film from being a total catastrophe, but they are obscured by bad acting, holes in the plot, deus ex machina, insults, stupid dialogues, weak script and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br / > What we have here is a horror movie with a plot that doesn't go anywhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy who gets first (yes, that cliché seems to still be very much alive in Finland), seems to have problems trying to get out of a mysteriously empty hospital. There are strident ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought that at least they didn't use the zombies, but they came), and the Finnish band of glam-rock with the demonic makeup, which intruded. There is also a bit of doodle in the turn of the time, but it doesn't add anything to the plot. The autistic girl and a hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of a situation, but they never describe it to the viewer or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of deep thoughts of life lessons such as: "What happens will happen ..." or "The light cannot live in darkness ..." or the disturbing "I need a red crayon .. red crayon ". So all these characters (including the worried father and the sweet doctor in the types of danger) end up doing run around them on dark floors, and from or wrongly to the demons. From time to time a ghost or a group of zombies appear, and if it seems that a keyboardist of demons fails to identify a group of six people who is approaching, waving a flashlight and talking, it's just pretend. And apparently this demon can break through the walls without too much trouble, but opening the elevator door is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end we also get a sequence twist "it was all a dream". Or maybe it wasn't. Oh boy, I wish this movie was, and that guy who makes time seem to move faster so everything takes place in just 10 minutes or so ...
