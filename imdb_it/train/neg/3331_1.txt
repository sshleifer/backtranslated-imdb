Dreck on three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festival (or something). All hotels are booked so they must spend the night in an old creepy house. What they don't know is that there is a disturbing inhabitant who likes to kill ... <br /> <br /> Yawn. Boring, useless, absolutely stupid "horror" movie. Bach and his two friends are certainly beautiful but the film itself is boring and boring! Bach and her friends are not actresses: their faces are completely empty. The last "revelation" is ridiculously predictable and there is no blood or blood to keep you interested along the way. There are some expected free female nudity, but it's not enough to save this. Boring, useless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
