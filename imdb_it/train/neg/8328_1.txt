If you want to see a movie that is strangely filmed, strangely lit, strange stories of these men (and a woman) who enjoy slamming each other, if you want to enjoy a story that is not going anywhere in these two guys, one a boxer and the other a homosexual, so you should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I felt almost wounded and cut, like the director (of the film) himself slammed out of me. <br /> <br /> This is a film where you don't want to watch the plot or the acting, this is a film that runs with horror and wonder. A bit like watching a plane crash or a train accident. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie, a good movie, a "B" movie or even a mediocre movie, this movie is not. <br /> <br /> A warning to all those who watch this film, please don't eat before. You may want to throw up by the end of the movie.
