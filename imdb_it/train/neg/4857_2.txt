I really liked ZB1. Really, I did it. I have no problem with very low budget films, and I liked films with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing, take a look at 'wiseguys vs. zombies', if you're interested ). In fact, I prefer zombie movies with lower budgets, because I suspect that Hollywood directors don't understand what zombies are. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just so bad. It was delayed. I don't want to worry about being dignified in my criticisms. I want my 90 minutes back, except that it actually only took ~ 80 minutes, because in part I put it forward by 1.4X. <br /> <br /> Ok, here are some criticisms. <br /> <br /> 1. The pace was TERRIBLE. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when someone has just had a single line, the camera works and the assembly and insertion of a group of F bombs in each sentence make the SENTIRE line look like a monologue. At first I was excited for the 90 minutes of execution compared to the 70 minutes of ZB1, but in reality there were fewer "events" in ZB3. Everything is talking. <br /> <br /> 2. The effects of blood have become more stupid. Only the glop rubs on people's bellies. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exposure, there wasn't really a plot. And the exhibition is truly epic! I won't ruin it if you look at it. (Don't watch it.) But then, I'm just a bunch of lame characters walking around and arguing for ~ 80 minutes. or less, if desired.
