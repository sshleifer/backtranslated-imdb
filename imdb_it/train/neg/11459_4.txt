Whale hunters take the wrong whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo whale exploiters capture a female and bind her with her tail fin. The whale watcher sees everything, including the moment when the unborn child of the female slips out and lets herself fall on the bridge. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could say that the great male is really mad by the way he stared at him as if he wanted to say: "Get out of the city before high tide" <br /> <br /> This story of revenge has the presence of Harris and the beauty of Bo, but not much else. This was Bo's first "released" film, although his first acting role dates back four years to "And Once Upon a Love", released in 1981 as "Fantasies" (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20th) is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a "whale" of a good time ..... got it? ..... whale? ..... hee-hee.
