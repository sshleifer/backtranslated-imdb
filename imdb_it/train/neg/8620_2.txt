I wasn't sure that Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the movie "Malibu Express". With his movie Fit to Kill he showed that Sidaris is a serious director and not just a one-shot director. The plot written by Sidaris, which has been passed so ungratefully by the Academy, is a complex script involving many unseen twists. The main characters have composed the work for a radio station sexually known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they face their long-standing nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most precious diamonds. A well written script is not everything, the excellent acting of the cast helps guarantee this film as a cult classic. Panning by critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated for years to come. Now it is suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, but in the future it will undoubtedly be recognized. I am disappointed that no critical circles have recognized Andy Sidaris' filmmaking. The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of cinema. It might make you better ignore the sad assessment of this movie and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as dense as the blockbuster movie Runaway Bride, and the action is better than or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep it up.
