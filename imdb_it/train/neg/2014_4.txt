I remember loving this show when I was a child. I thought the helicopter was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. It was ultra high-tech for now. It could repel enemy fire, do all kinds of stunts in the air and shoot down almost everything that way. Now I go back to look at him today and I'm surprised how bad this show is. The cast members are hardly convincing, there are a lot of bad moments, and the fight scenes are incredibly fake. And almost every ending has the same helicopter that fights shit with the obvious re-use of low quality grainy footage. Most of the footage seems to date back to the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf has basically the same theme as the Knight Knight, except for the vehicle that fights the chosen crime: a helicopter instead of a car. After seeing some episodes, I found myself completely bored. However, I love the theme of music.
