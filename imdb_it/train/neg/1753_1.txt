Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I have looked forward to watching this film and finding out more about his life. Words fail to express my disappointment. This film was disconnected ... it did not provide any background on his life, no historical context and nothing about his great writings (except a brief reference to a colleague's "cost of discipleship" at the beginning of the film) Instead, we see him having fun with jazz (apparently in the United States) and relaxing with his friends before he decides to return to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands up for his faith. Instead of emphasizing this, we get a very bad love affair with a seventeen-year-old student. Regardless of whether it actually happened, it should not have been an important part of the film. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narrative explaining what his writings were ... or SOMETHING to let us know a little of the greatness of this man. drum roll ..... waiting ..... .... waiting ..... ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives "Christian Films" a bad name. All they had to do was create a structure for the film to follow, with some background ... even some voiceover, or flashbacks for him that preached from his works ... some story about who he was and where he was. But no ... this is what we got. Hardly suitable for a hero of faith.
