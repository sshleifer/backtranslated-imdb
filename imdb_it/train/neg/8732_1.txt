The plot talks about the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie, he seems to have some problems with his daughter. Eventually the serial killer is captured. That's all. But before you find out who the dunnit is, you have to see some terrible acting by all the actors. It's amazing how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but this is a waste of my time. Don't watch the movie. I warned you
