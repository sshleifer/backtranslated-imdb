The animation was good, the image was good, though not entirely original, however, the plot was too long, too confusing and very dramatic. After about an hour I couldn't wait to get it over with. With so many characters that have nothing to offer and plot elements that come from nowhere or go nowhere, this film wasn't really a movie and it would have been better than a short series or maybe two films. If you like this kind of typical story you may like it, but honestly, I was spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have a message of some sort to say. Go and rent a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you'll come out more.
