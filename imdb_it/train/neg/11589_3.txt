Barrel at the bottom of the Freddy. This is the worst film in the series, beating "Freddy's Revenge" for that title. An economic aspect (with mediocre special effects), incoherent disorder, with Freddy transformed into a madman. It has one or two interesting lines, but this does not spare this illogical and sloppy sequel.
