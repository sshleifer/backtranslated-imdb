I realize that several Ben Stiller films have come out or will be released this year, but perhaps they should insist on quality, not quantity. I was stunned by what the filmmakers thought would go for the comedy in "Along Came Polly" ". <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is strident, without charm and ranks as one of the worst shows of the year. "Stiller is getting boring. He undoubtedly has a comedic talent, but he needs to find another guy or take a break, find material that is actually fun. Because his films go from painfully humorless to terribly ugly. <Br /> <br /> There is absolutely no connection between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, which is a shame because she is a good, intelligent actress with a promising career, as long as she continues to make films like "The Good Girl" (where she's fantastic) and less like "Along Came Polly", she'll have a career she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston is desperate to overcome the soft stuff she's working with, but it's a daunting task for any actress . With the' except for a few moments with Alec Baldwin, like Reuben Stan's boss, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben Sandy's best friend, there's nothing funny about this terrible movie. Other secondary characters, including Debra Messing as Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are boring. Azaria's accent isn't just stupid, it's terribly unattractive. <br /> <br /> The premise of "Along Came Polly" has certainly proved its promise. Unfortunately, he needed a writer who could turn it into a good comedy, instead of this boring, boring and boring excuse for a comedy.
