Disappointing and irritating. The writer has no real understanding of human nature, but combines clich√©s together in a disjointed way. The character is not explored in depth. These are puppets thrown down in a plot that he openly confesses to needing a dramatic element, the mother's relationship with her daughter's lover. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid offers an excellent performance despite the particular situations and lines, such as to passively leave the angry daughter to make it appear in the eyes. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde with no clue as to why, except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /> <br /> A mature writer could have done much more with this topic.
