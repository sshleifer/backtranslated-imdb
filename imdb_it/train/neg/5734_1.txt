This is the kind of movie that is so terrible that you can't stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that "it can't continue to be so nasty until the end. I just can't. You know," worse than Jaws 4 "- kind of ugly . <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think I saw only ONE movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking about religious bullshit about how you end up in hell for lying or watching football. <br /> < br /> Gore? Indeed and a lot. Gore well done? Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> The acting is not bad and all the lines are bad clich√©s.The same goes for the plot that consists only of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore movies. <br /> <br /> If you're hoping for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground, keep searching, you won't find it in Live Feed.
