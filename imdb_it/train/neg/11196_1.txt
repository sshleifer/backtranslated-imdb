My friends and I left after 15 minutes and we weren't the first. Later, we tried to get our money back. The cinema management didn't allow it, but they agreed to let us see another movie. The only time it worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Ex Star child. As you can see, this was not a memorable evening. Probably one of my worst movie nights. The second second must be when I saw a double hit of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. In conclusion, for the good of humanity, please do not see the Order.
