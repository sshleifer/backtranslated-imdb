This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, since it's absolutely terrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen. All the characters are boring, and the story is terrible, plus I could see the two twists eventually coming in kilometers away! The fantastic setting and the creepy house would surely have helped if it weren't so boring, and there isn't a single character to root for either, I also hope it got to the bottom 100, because it deserves to be there in my opinion. When John Carradine finally shows up at the end, it's a pretty good scene, but it's already too late, and the only other screen he had was in flashback, plus the only really bloody scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee, as it was rather bloody. I got this in a Horror DVD set called Back From The Grave and everybody is really hyperactive in my opinion, plus it's fortunate that this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have thrown out the window! This is one of the most boring horror movies I've ever seen, because it's absolutely terrible, John Carradine has a very limited screen, and I say avoid it like the plague! You don't want to go through torture. The management is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson makes an absolutely terrible one! I work here, making everything cheap, wasting its potential to create an eerie atmosphere and simply keeping the film at an incredibly boring pace. The action is just as bad. John Carradine is good in his scene, but apart from the fact that in the film he does nothing but flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders behaves terribly like Laura, since she has not convinced me at all. Ivy Bethune is fine, and somehow creepy, but also overly concerned, she finally had a disturbing smile. As for the rest of the cast, I didn't pay enough attention, as I had a lot of trouble getting over it, but they were all very bad. In general, please avoid this, it's not worth it! BOMB on 5
