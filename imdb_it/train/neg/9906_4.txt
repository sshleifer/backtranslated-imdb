After reading the reviews, it became evident that they all intellectualized this work. How absolutely boring. Oh how about the good old days and there was nothing like that. Of all the comments, no one has expressed any emotion for this job or for anyone else. <br /> <br /> I grew up shortly after the end of the steam era and this cinematic gem together with Dan'l Boone graced the Saturday afternoon matinees. This was an annual film that went around and filled the seats with gabbing monsters, barking, farting, giggling, brats like me or themselves. And it was a filler for the cinema at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every criticism contains something about the plot. The problem was that it was rather a model. Here it is. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats those evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us kids understood that plot before we took down our fourth to watch it. That was the plot of every Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers film ever made. If you take the time to go back and review all the films, don't ask for surprises. <br /> <br /> We must remember the context of the times. There was little or little TV. None for children. There was school. There were large open spaces. There were toy guns. No cyber time. And the steam era had just collapsed. But films like this provided entertainment and filled the imagination of young whippersnappers. Even the girls got in there. <br /> <br /> This film was entertainment. And it is just as unreasonable as anything produced today. It originally had a purpose of being propaganda. But soon they became children's films. <br /> <br /> Our fathers lived the real thing. And it would not have been until Sam Peckinpah, a decade later, finally poured the red splashes of blood imitation in realistic and abundant quantities. Not before his direction, no one died slowly, with great pain and miserable. Until Peckinpah's war and gun fights were a rather drab affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie, it had little or no blood, adults didn't care. I would not have tolerated it. No courage to spray overwhelming plant life. So this film had all the glory and none of the bloodiest. Gung Ho was child friendly. <br /> <br /> You will see that I have assigned a four to this evaluation. Why should I do it? Well. It's a terrible movie. No matter how much I like it. I love this movie because it brought back one of the happiest moments of my childhood. But it is not the best of a film in terms of quality. Basically Gung Ho has turned into a romance for children. <br /> <br /> People should watch it. Obviously. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistically however. The plot is simple. The superficial characters? they are dry. You can love a bad movie.
