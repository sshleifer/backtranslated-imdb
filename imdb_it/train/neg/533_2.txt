I knew that "Evening" was a movie for girls, so I expected to get bored. An evil mockery on IMDb had said it was a "successful movie", but that your partner would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when we went out together we were amazed to find out that they only lasted two hours - it seemed like a much longer evening than that! I suppose, for Yanks, it should be high or fascinating because it concerns the rich people who live on the beach - well, near the beach, in a house with a large veranda and a lawn, but with no apparent lawnmower. If this kind of thing hits you, it might seem like a short film. <br /> <br /> There is a Monty Python movie about a Knight who will not die. He ends up yelping (because Yanks adds a third syllable to this word I wonder) the bust in the street that still screams threats to his nemesis. This film also speaks of a sort of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the serious evader shown here) continues to die without having inappropriate guilt feelings. She is not worried that she was a child wide open and breathless, but she imagines herself a murderer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being a movie for girls, there is a guy who should be Mr Darcy / Heathcliff's character. I'm not a woofter, so I can't claim to be a good judge of these things, but the boring whining that is pushed out for this role seems to have only the title of servant in his favor. It's a bloodless cypher. <br /> <br /> As one might gather, the main characters are not a great policeman, but the minors succeed, incredibly, to be much worse. There's a guy whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is pregnant. Fair enough, but it's not the role of Hamlet - why do it so badly? Forgetting that it was a movie for girls, I thought he would be thrown out because every decent girl would have said that the facial mushroom didn't flatter him, but then I realized that she must have encouraged him to grow up 'beard' because he looked worse without it . <br /> <br /> I woke up noticing which actors and actresses had their ear lobes attached or free and noticing interesting pieces of scenery - if you are dragged over, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the genus of what you would expect in a beach cottage. <br /> <br /> In addition to mandatory marriage, there is only one piece of action. You would have thought they were right. Unfortunately, however, the fatal accident is performed by a car that couldn't be there. When the incident is discovered, the cast roams around screaming for a character they may not know is near (but we do it as the audience). If they have no idea that the person is a couple of miles from the place, then why are they wandering around screaming aimlessly for him? I suppose the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a dream sequence half-remembered ... <br /> <br /> Another scenic element that caught my eye was a pot with a copper bottom. I didn't think the technology to do it was developed until the fifties.
