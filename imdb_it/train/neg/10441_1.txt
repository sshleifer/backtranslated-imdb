I stopped watching this POS as soon as the snakes began to "conquer" the plane. At first I thought that maybe he should get a "one" for the comic relief. But then I realized that I could only watch the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Any respect I might have had for Samuel Jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood proves once again how far they are from the reality they really are. When I was a child, we took snakes for fun. The only thing snakes would do is curl up on the bottom of the hold. And no number of Hollywood cartoon snakes can change it. <br /> <br /> This film is not worth a trip to Blockbuster. Attention: if you pay him, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest the Descent. If you want humor, go to your local cabaret club. Their worst performer will be a million times better than this junk.
