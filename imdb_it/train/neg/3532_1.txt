It's like taking the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, taking away all their style and class and mixing them with a lot of pretentious new waves "I am intellectual so my film must be difficult to make sense of the film" creates junk , purified in some extra styles for good measure, cut off the finish, there you have Revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it a little after seeing it, and yes it was kind of to make sense, but that doesn't prevent it from being junk. <br /> <br /> Wasting money. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> Up there as the worst movie I've ever seen, with not even a bad value for the cinematic novelty to redeem it a little.
