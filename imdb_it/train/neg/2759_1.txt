Exhilarating, resounding strong moments ... and yet not a comedy. I particularly liked the gag sown by the ambulance that soaked the "filthy ass" that then screams behind them in anger "you lousy bums", I mean wow, someone's online degree in literature is bearing fruit! The worst script imaginable, with the introductory plot in an instant, the ridiculous movement in history, the development of the ZERO character (even among the characters you meet .. it's as if everyone has known each other and trusted each other other for years). effects and texture holes .. oh god there are holes in the plot !! To be honest, I write this without having seen the whole thing, but I certainly expect that the last 30 minutes will not exactly improve the already pathetic attempt in the cinema ... thank god we have a nice advantage that we can do we forget that the film it's a load of ... well ... use your imagination for the conclusion of that particular sentence!
