Another chapter of the current question, whatever happened to Mel Brooks' sense of humor? He starts quite well, with Mel as the Trump magnate Goddard Bolt ("You can call me God"), who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days. But the moment the film hits the streets, it turns into a mess full of pathos, with occasional "funny" interpolated bits (Mel sees a black boy dancing for money and trying to do a winged vaudeville, yuk, what a disgust). Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of wasted. The worst part is the musical number of this film, in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance with "Easy to Love" by Cole Porter. Brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his films; here it sounds all straight, like a dancing piece taken from a guest star in "The Carol Burnett Show" (in which Rudy DeLuca, co-author of this film, started his career). Go to charlie Chaplin's THE KID, which covered the same land 70 years ago and did a lot
