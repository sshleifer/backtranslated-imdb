A bizarre American family, on vacation to the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. They do not know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence is haunting them. I generally love mysterious horror movies like this. "Cube", Spielberg "Duel" and "The Birds" are all excellent examples of films that give no answers but leave us curious and want more. Apparently, the writer / director of "Disappearance" Walter Klenhard was trying to make just that kind of film, and whether he succeeded or not was up to the viewer. Personally I think it came halfway, then the film has just been sunk. <br /> <br /> The actors are all of the "ho-hum" type. They are not particularly bad, but we as an audience never feel their fear and react to situations in unrealistic ways. Is anyone else absolutely SICK of characters who are going out to investigate strange sounds?!?!? At least give them some kind of justification to do it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> As for the films made for TV, it is certainly an above average fair. Director Klenhard should be praised for really milking the desert environment for everything he offered and some environments were amazing. There is a really fantastic scene in which two characters find an old nuclear test field where the sand has completely melted into the glass as far as the eye can see. I wonder if it was true ?? <br /> <br /> Is there anything to talk about, and "creatures" ?? or what the hell is that after these people are never shown, not to mention that we are never given a real clue what they are (mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient and evil Indian spirits) Oh, that really reduces it for us !) or where it comes from. <br /> <br /> Here too there are many clich√©s. Why are the city people in these films always really stupid? Why is there always an old man who everyone thinks is crazy that turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? What about a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" tries to be different and intelligent but eventually fails because in many ways it is too familiar for us fans of the video horror forage. Hey, I've seen much worse movies, and the disappearance isn't bad, is it just too much ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
