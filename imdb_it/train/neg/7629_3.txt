I gave this film a very fair opportunity, and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the public, even though the egotist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) gets "great performances" on a pile of hams in their debuts. A lot of teenage sex cliches come out of this movie, like Doing the Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Doing the Ugly Prostitute (which is very embarrassing shot and grinds things to a complete stop, not that things are going anywhere anyway) skinny dipping. <br /> <br /> I suppose this movie should be fun due to all the nonsense of sex, for me, it was just annoying. I was seriously much more amused by wiping my nails than by looking at this mess.
