Friday the 13th step! There is officially a worse movie than your hateful series out there. I won this movie in a college contest, and it was a waste of money though free. Jack Jones plays a really terrible singer whose attempt to find some killers or something. At least Friday, the thirteenth never bores me. I'd rather have your nails pulled rather than see it again.
