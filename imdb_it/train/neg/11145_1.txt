Where to start? . . . I feel ... violated! Right, violated! I just spent 1.5 hours of my life, 1.5 hours that I could have spent doing something more useful, like looking at dry paint, in this so-called horror movie. <br /> <br /> It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not dramatic, there's no action, it's nothing ... <br /> <br /> Its predictable, its boring, its tragic ... <br /> <br /> I could come a little hard here, but watch this movie and you will feel the same way ... or ... no, don't look at it ... unless you want to hear you too have been violated.
