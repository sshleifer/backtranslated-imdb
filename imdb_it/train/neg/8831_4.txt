Having heard so many enthusiastic people about this film, I thought I'd try it. Besides being incredibly slow, I don't mind until the wait was worth it, but it's not. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film doesn't sound real. The reaction of the 4 men goes from shock to horror in finding the body to complete indifference while fishing. Surely if they were the kind of men who would continue to fish happily, they would have just reported the body and said they had discovered it only after their fishing trip ... why ever tie the body to a tree, go fishing? and then tell everyone that you found the body 2 days earlier? It's so hard to watch a movie knowing that the behavior of the main characters is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the citizens, well, you'd think that at least one of them could show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except for the panties .... what scenario leads to this? If she was raped, then why still have her panties? If she was raped with clothes, then why remove them after removing her panties? If she wasn't raped, then why take off all the clothes from her panties ... leaving you with the tests to dispose of? I really can't think of a realistic scenario that would lead to that in addition to killing someone to steal their clothes so they can fill your chaos selling stall! Oh well it is watchable but only and only because, despite the poor script, the acting is strong.
