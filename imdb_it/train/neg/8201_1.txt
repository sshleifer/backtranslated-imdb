Curl up in your favorite chair and turn on the play station while you throw it into the waste disposal unit. Spend 90 minutes enjoying your favorite game. Disconnected - badly filmed - non-direct garbage. It takes a while from many other "science fiction" films and tries badly to unite the parts in a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers don't seem to realize that providing simple entertainment could get a monetary game, but you need a touch of ingenuity and talent to turn it into a good movie. Any money spent looking at this is a waste, and personally I would like my 90 minutes of life back.
