I have no idea what idiots gave this film a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious! Actually I looked at the whole thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a useless film. There is nothing interesting in the plot, the characters are without depth and there is no attempt to give any kind of atmosphere with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure you bring something to throw up because cinematography is simply someone running around with a camcorder and half the time you can't even look at the main subjects. This style has been used most successfully in films like "Blair Witch" because it creates suspense. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend something. I should have known better when it arrived at 2am that it would be horrible.
