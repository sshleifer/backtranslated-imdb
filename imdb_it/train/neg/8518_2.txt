I am amazed how many comments on this show concern how "real" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's above the top in a fantastic way. <br /> <br /> Acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through. That's not what I call true. <br /> <br /> He is so serious in his desire to be "relevant" that he only shows how cut off from reality is Rob Thomas and his staff. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found that it was at best a snooze-fest and at worst a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to say with the exaggerated style of the whole show.
