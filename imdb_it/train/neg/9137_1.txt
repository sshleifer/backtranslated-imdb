What can I say, this is a fantastic film that should have won an Oscar. A copy must be kept safe in a secure vault for posterity. Visualization should be required for all high school students worldwide. Sam Mraovich is a genius, perhaps the most brilliant writer / director / producer / cook / babysitter / walmart greeter to embellish the world of cinema with his art. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? Every millisecond of Ben and Arthur was so breathtaking! And Mraovich as Arthur, wow, is so attractive that I'm surprised he didn't go for Mr. Universe. I could not contain myself during the naked scene. I loaned this film to my brother and he called me on the phone saying that Arthur's naked scene made him gay. Of course I am totally helpful, thanks to this film and the wonderfully elaborated tolerance lessons. Because yesterday I burned a church and wrote "for Sam and Arthur" in its smoldering ashes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was the best thing about this movie. When that Fed-Ex plane took off among the Vermont palm trees, I cried! Because, I never even knew they had palm trees in Vermont or that people could travel on Fed-Ex airplanes before this movie. He opened my eyes to a new realm of possibilities. This film inspired me to enroll in Sam Mraovich's school of screenwriting, acting, directing, composition, casting, production, production and real estate. I just want to say: "Thank you, Mr. Mraovich, thank you for bringing this creation into the world, we can never repay you enough."
