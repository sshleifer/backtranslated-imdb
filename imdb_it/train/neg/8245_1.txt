I can't believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie movies, but this is absolutely sucked. Low budget does not mean that the film should be demented. Horror does not mean that the film should be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie. It was just a gore-fest, and particularly disturbing. The acting was average, considering that they were unheard of actors, but the plot was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to become "artistic", or something like that. This is not one of those great independent films that cost only thousands of dollars, but they are incredibly well made. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on the film. Other reviews have also said that the soundtrack was sucked ... it is because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the film's authors. There were no saving qualities for this film at all. A complete waste of time and money.
