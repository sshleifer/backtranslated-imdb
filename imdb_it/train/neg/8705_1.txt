This film is the worst movie I've ever seen ... it's as bad as it is awful ... for as long as I was watching it I almost expected the music to start and the doctor start dancing ... (I've seen porn with a better plot) When the raptor was trying to enter the door I think someone was throwing a plastic doll at the door about 2 meters away. But as I said it's so bad you have to watch it so you can see how bad it is that I explain that it won't do anything if you look at it .. I don't recommend renting it but if it comes on TV watch it for about 30 minutes just to see what i mean. I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes, but if you can sit for the whole scene, you have good willpower
