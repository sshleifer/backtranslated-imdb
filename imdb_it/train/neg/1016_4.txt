The film itself is not so bad; many comments highlighted the obvious flaws in the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me goose bumps is that people like Justin Timberlake are even casts for movies, and especially for movies like this. I must admit that I had never heard that man's name before looking at it, but at the very moment it appeared I was simply annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad copy of Legolas, the posture is horrible and he can't even coordinate all three correctly. That said, he delighted me when he jumped after leaving the nightclub, because I was hoping that from that moment on, only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey would be. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason why I gave this to 4. <br /> <br /> I see a lot of films coming out with the little Timberlake cast ... I can believe it.
