I was looking for a nice and simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film was a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> I can't write a single positive thing. First, the script is stupid and it's not funny at all, based on tired, recycled jokes and a fart tortoise for laughter. In my book, it's not funny, it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Low-budget "effects" (if I may even call them effects) with horrible cinematography. In many places it seems almost an independent film shot without money. <br /> <br /> Acting ... I feel sorry for the actors. Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards desperate for money that they agreed to take part in? (Looking at their recent filmography, it would seem so.) Despite the clothes, Pamela is showing her age and, on the whole, they don't even show up sexy, if not funny. <br /> <br /> This film is not even in the so-bad-is-fun category. It's just ugly, as if all concerned were sick. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
