If the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal, then the demarcation line for this movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most boring movies I've ever had the pleasure of trying and watching lately. I found the dvd around my friends' house, and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can't say any details without ruining the film because there are only about 5 details for this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a film about things on c-span only that the fiction film is 10 times less interesting than the most boring debate on c-span. <br /> <br /> I think there's a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I wasn't able to say exactly what it was after I threw my eyeballs away and threw them at Richard Gere.
