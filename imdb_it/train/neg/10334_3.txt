A story of extraordinary disinterest kills "The Psychic" again and again. The characters and the plot are completely uninteresting (as is the crazy work of Fulci's camera, which is usually a saving factor in his films), and any suspense is nowhere to be found. It is completed at an unbearable level - in the end, you won't be asking for excitement, but you'll be struck by boredom (and, like me, maybe an uncontrollable need to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance deserves to be occupied in a better film. Watch out for Fulci's star players: there is not much to do in "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
