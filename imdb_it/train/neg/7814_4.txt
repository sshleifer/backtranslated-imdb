After a long period in space, in search of the remains of the planet Krypton, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Earth. He misses Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), who got married and has a son with Richard White (James Marsden). Meanwhile, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) draws an evil plan, using the crystals he stole from the Fortress of Solitude, to create a new land and immerse the United States. <br /> <br /> After so many delicious Superman movies with the unforgettable Christopher Reeve, or TV shows such as "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville", a great expectation was created for the return of Superman in Bryan Singer's version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is too long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in IMDb. Furthermore, the love story between Lois Lane and Superman is something shamefully ridiculous. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is wrongly misplaced, playing the role of a mature journalist and an experienced mother of a five-year-old child. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays a teenager Clark Kent in "Smallville". Parker Posey's character, Kitty Kowalski, is actually a stupid caricature. Last but not least and despite being a terrifying Lex Luthor, Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, so he is older and bigger than the rest of the main cast. The dull conclusion seems like a soap opera and it's terrible. My vote is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Superman Returns"
