This film is one of those that I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life in which I will never return. The premise is really interesting - in essence it is a film of zombies from the point of view of the undead (we do not divide the hair actually are dead or not}. Unfortunately, they fail to provide a compelling story within this framework. The monotony almost unbearable the lives of the central characters can add to the realism of the film, but it sucks all the value of the fun. If they had made an extra effort to keep the spectator busy, they would have been much more likely to drive the social comment home.
