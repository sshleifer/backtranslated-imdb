The buzz of this film has always been the fabulous graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, then the fool and finally every visible element of this film. Because, there is nothing else to show. <br /> <br /> Gary Thompson and Andrew Marlowe are listed as writing credits for this film. I really don't think they exist. I think they bought this script in "Scripts-R-Us", where you buy a standard "Monster Movie" script and fill in the blanks. There is a monster that chases us. Let's split. (Actually "let's split up" in this movie). Hit Alien / Giant-bug / Monster / Invisible-man with crowbar. Not dead yet Burn the huge rabbit / Shark / Invisible man in the unsolvable fire. Not dead yet Sai, standard things. Even the minimum number of specific elements for a film of an invisible man (the IR glasses, which sprayed with something like paint) were badly handled. <br /> <br /> What is sad is that there were many possibilities for this to be a fascinating film.

All in all, it's smelly. <br /> <br /> I'd like to mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the film's ending, but I don't want to spoil it. Suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid that they don't think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than ...
