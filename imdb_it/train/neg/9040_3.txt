I agree that although this Melville story may simply be unrepeatable, this is not even a credible attempt. Moving history into the 20th century is a real outrage for the intent and nature of the original story; maybe you could have moved it to England, but it must be a period piece. Even our storyteller - the owner - tells it in a flashback, going even further back, around 1800. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strangely disobedient worker would have been discarded without a thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a break eliminated expletive !!! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work very well, in view of the ending. And the film's ending? I don't know what it was, because I didn't watch the whole parody - I had to stop. It was like setting "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
