Short version: The seed is not useless. It is only derivative and inferior. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: if you have never seen any of the films that include the vaguely defined "psychological horror" genre, this film will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a nice burn. The opening assembly of real animal abuse will be enough to open your eyes to the possibilities of brutality on video, and perhaps the most memorable (later) gore scene in the film will be more than you can handle. The climax will play with your emotions in a way that perhaps no other film has. <br /> <br /> But this is if you don't have much experience with the genre. If you saw the real thing ... "August Underground's Penance", for example, as you did, you will find it terribly difficult to stay awake until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers have compared this with old videos from the past. I understand this comparison. Like the video nasties, "Seed" is more violent than a mainstream and less subtle horror film. But the reason why video concepts are still known to us is not just for the reasons mentioned above - those that are still popular have something special. Allow me to be ambiguous, I think you will understand: those who stayed around had a soul. <br /> <br /> Take this quote from Gabriele Crisanti, director of "Burial Ground", in an interview with the new -ish DVD: "... we will never have more films like these, because today the technology has surpassed imagination and technology is cold, so many things will disappear because small films like these will no longer be produced, great, exceptional tricks that are very expensive, but are cold. Today a horror, a film of terror of this kind costs more than a million dollars. These films were not so expensive ... they are real effects, made with our own hands ". <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is wrong to take the confrontation with the horror of the old school seriously. But Crisanti hit the nail on the head. Even in their apparently more exploitative aspect, the best of nasal videos pursued a primitive "truth". And here is where Boll falls short. It is as if he had seen the movies and had not understood them. Everything on the checklist is there ... BS on "making a statement about humanity", an obscene torture scene, etc. But it is, as Crisanti says, "cold". Blood is all in CGI. Everything looks like scenes put together by other films of various genres. And the pace is tremendously slow. A man so slow. <br /> <br /> Another interesting note: the only gore scene really reminded me of a video game. <br /> <br /> However, enough BS. Weak film
