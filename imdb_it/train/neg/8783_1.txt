I don't think I've ever been so impressed by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my whole life as when I came out of this piece of shit. Nothing in it makes any sense. none of this is smart or well thought out. for lack of truly suspenseful moments, they repeatedly use the total check-trick where you build the music before the character does something like open a door or set aside a curtain and then there's nothing. this is OK to do once, maybe, but I counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason, characters, semi-formed plot textures ... the characters weren't well developed at ALL. the ending was ... bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component of this movie is terrible. and I'm just here to warn you of all this.
