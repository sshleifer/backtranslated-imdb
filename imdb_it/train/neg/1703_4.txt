A veterinarian from Vietnam decides to take over a ruined ruined city, and anyone on his way is eliminated (including women). Released in theaters just before "A Star Is Born", which changed his career, this jumble of action with Kris Kristofferson is wildly inconsiderate, reckless and petty. Shot in Simi Valley, California, the results are really inconvenient, with redneck clich√©s and senseless violence that make up the bulk of director George Armitage's script. Armitage has picked up the most curious cast of the '70s for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters and, a little, Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole affair is Kristofferson, who is grumpy and rude. It deserves the points I suppose to be a completely unpleasant drive-in thriller, but the negative vibrations (and the ridiculous climax) cover the entire project like a bad stain. * 1/2 from ****
