What a confusing mess. I saw it with a friend some time ago and we consider ourselves both open to the many wonders of cinema, but this is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> While there might be very good ideas / concepts and there are certainly some good performances (given the circumstances), it is all buried by random nonsense. Sir Anthony is too involved in the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar films with regards to editing, or perhaps he was observed in Nixon as a source of inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he most often has a method for madness. <br /> <br /> His quote stating that he made the film as a joke says it all. Not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
