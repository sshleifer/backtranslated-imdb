I tried to sit through this bomb not long ago. What a mess. The acting was atrocious. There were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat like a main balloon. This was mainly due to the fact that the actors' reactions were just not true. It was a modern reworking of Hitchcock's original "lifeboat". I believe Hictcock rotates circles in his grave at the very thought of it. From what I've been able to endure, there is nothing irresistible in this movie.it boasts some semi-big names, but they don't put any effort into their characters. But, you know, to be honest, it wasn't the fault of nobody actually. I mean, I'm pretty sure the script exploded in the first explosion. LOL.it it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it proceeds. But for me, I am not willing to spend at least three days to find out.so unless you have at least a three-day weekend on the horizon, avoid this puzzone / 1/10
