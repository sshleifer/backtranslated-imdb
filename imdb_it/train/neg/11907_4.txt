I realized that the character of Diehl is configured as a microcosm of America itself - to see Arab terrorists under every rock, only to find out in the end that it is his own actions that brought him into that state of siege and really if he practice goodwill to all men, everything will be rainbow and lollipops. I am sorry that you have made extraordinary films in the past that remain neutral in politics and, for good reason, the controversy is your weak point and weaken this well-made and incredibly filmed movie with absurd characters, dialogues and plot. Better luck for your next movie. Another thing that jerked my crank was the convinced point of the homeless section of Los Angeles that was there for hunger reasons, these people never have enough to eat. These people really are not eating royally, but the real hunger of these people is spiritual hunger, emotional hunger, mental hunger. They need respect for themselves, self-esteem, dignity that cannot be given to a man. Yes those people are hungry and if they need it is available. The less the center of hunger in America, I would say that it is more the center for alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering and economic devastation. Facing hunger even if a noble attempt is to foster a more unregulated and systematic human problem than the society of the homeless. Bill Diehl was still good and Michelle Williams was as pretty as the old soul of a young man (clich√©).
