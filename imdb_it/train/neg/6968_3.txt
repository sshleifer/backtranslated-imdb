An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to wither. It makes you tease or bite something about it. He quickly falls ill and spits a large white twisted larva into the hospital. A subsequent attempt to resurrect him with the oars results in a crash of blood. <br /> <br /> A policeman is at the hospital because his partner was seriously injured in a shooting. Somehow the policeman is paired with one of the doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought inside. There are many children who roam the hospital, which I suppose we should find adorable, but they are extremely annoying brats. It happens to wander in the room where the sample is stored, and it happens to discharge a growth hormone on it. The logic of the horror film would say that they deserve to die for this, but they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> The creature grows and begins to reproduce. People flee from it, and sometimes to it for some reason. The hospital is surrounded by soldiers who are ready to destroy everything, if necessary. <br /> <br /> There are no really compelling characters in the film, and most of the time people seem to look for the monster. It was pretty boring. Clearly he owes something to the Alien films, with the monster being born inside a human being and having different stages of its growth. There is also a character named Bishop, and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.
