I don't think any actor in the history of Hollywood lasted until David Niven gave most of the weak films that he had to bring with his incredible charm. He could act, get an Oscar, but most of the material he made was light as a single layer of two-layered tissue paper. <br /> <br /> Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. It's a musical and for the most part you will remember the Vera-Ellen dances. You will remember that I am in Scottish costume since the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can remember a single song from it you must have a photographic memory. <br /> <br /> The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the American protagonist of a musical that apparently is getting her proof out of town in Edinburgh. Start in the choir and run a day late. Takes a ride from the driver of a king of millionaire greeting cards. All now assume that she is the main pressure of the millionaire. The doors open like they never opened before. <br /> <br /> The millionaire is David Niven and accompanies him and the various situations generated by the error. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frenetic producer of this musical. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, Happy Go Lovely is a light and inoffensive down which David Niven has done so much and is tired of doing so.
