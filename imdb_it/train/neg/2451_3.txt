This film causes more involuntary laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, rent it just to laugh with your friends. I will not be the millionth person to ruin his faults ... all I will say is that the film (for me, anyway) has lost important points to transform my favorite character, Sam, into a bumbling idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
