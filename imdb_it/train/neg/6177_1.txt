The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top quality comedian, in other situations far from the Stooges. He had a clear experience to be very funny and intelligent. Moe and Larry and Shemp had known him or at least him for many years and loved his work. So what was happening on Earth when he joined the troop as the "third stooge"? Obviously, nothing. In most "late Stooge" short films, most of the time, the boys clash against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not an accurate Stooge label. "One for all, all for one, each for himself", to quote Curly from "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comic team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, it doesn't matter how much everyone tries to take advantage of each other or slap each other when the chips are actually down, they attack and come to the aid of one another. In this particular, none of this happens. It's almost like watching a dog fight while trying to cheat others or being bad and bad, and not for comic effects. One might assume that there is something behind the scenes that is happening here, art imitates life. Maybe he really was from here because Besser didn't stay long with Moe and Larry. Look at the history of the other teams and tell me I'm wrong.
