What was the purpose of this film? I would suggest making a handful of actors and their producers and directors a big payday for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. An intransigent former boxer comes across a strange woman and her relatives. He starts out as a steady man for the woman, and ends up beating a man and getting involved in a kidnapping scheme. He was so confused that I can't even write a decent criticism. If you see this, sweetheart, make sure it's dark and you can go to sleep.
