I feel it is my duty to be a lover of horror movies to warm others up with this horrible and terrible horror movie. Don't waste your time or money on this film, acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've encountered and the script was just awful. Nothing went well, you end up thinking about yourself because I'm looking at this shit. The plot had so many holes and in the end they didn't clear up, it was so bad, I don't know how you can make such a terrible movie. As I said before, I love horror films and I felt so disappointed, it was an 18 but you see little blood and no fear or jumps. Also, what bothered me was how stupid things happened in the movie that made no sense to the plot like the kissing brother and sister, why? that's all I can say. Just don't worry, there are many bigger horror movies, don't waste your life time is too short.
