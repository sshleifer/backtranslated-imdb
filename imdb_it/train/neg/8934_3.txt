I bought this DVD without previous references but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on the cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to look forward to seeing a funny comedy like "Switch". However the history of non-sense is horrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) undergoes surgery to change sex in Copenhagen and returns to Hollywood claiming to be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and to claim half ownership of Uncle Buck Loner (John Huston). During the days, Myra and her alter ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle's academy with a vicious sex. At one point, the messy script is so confusing that I think the whole story was just an incident-induced mental journey of Myron. Unfortunately the beauties of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett are not enough to hold this film. My vote is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman up to a point")
