Bonfires of the Vanities is a film full of sweat flops. I don't remember a film that has tried so hard to be so relentlessly outrageous, provocative and important, but that has failed so consistently across the board. It is like a standing comedian who does not make people laugh, but cannot leave the stage. The harder the film is, the stronger the attempt at laughter in a loud thud. The desperation that the film shows is so clear that it almost awakens pity for all those involved. <br /> <br /> The film reaches the state of laughter only twice. Once upon a time Geraldo Rivera is playing a hateful, arrogant and amoral tabloid television journalist - which is fun just because he apparently doesn't realize he's playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be mocked is the final "big moment" of the film, in which the judge played by Morgan Freeman utters the rough lesson on morality ("that's what your mom taught you!"). The pomposity of the moment is offensive to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> However, it must be admitted that it is a noble effort. He has a group of good actors, even if poorly cast, who try to create characters with thin caricatures of cardboard. The film seems professionally created and the little cinematic that director Brian DePalma loves is obvious, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wants to be a commentary on morality and modern ethics, never stands above the level of comics. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. The sitcom also requires time. But the best bonfires can take desperation. In the end, you don't want to laugh, you just want to turn your back.
