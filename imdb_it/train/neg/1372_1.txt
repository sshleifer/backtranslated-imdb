I saw this on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see it or spend the money for the rental. The film is completely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner to the winding electric cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable: the expert avalanche guy is hit by a 20-foot wave of breaking bone (using real footage) and all he has to do is stand up and shake himself. The avalanche thunders at millions of miles per hour and stops at the sides of the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the avalanche materials are impressive and show their devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the material staged makes this film even more slender. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't worry about it even on T.V.
