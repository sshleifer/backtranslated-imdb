I've always been enthusiastic about vintage dramas, an art form in which the BBC excelled in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was incredible. Incredibly bad! The script was terrible, the acting uninspired and all the characters sadly insipid. Apparently Byron was "crazy and ugly and dangerous to know", and highlighted the hearts of women. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a small deranged man who had jumped up instead of the fiery hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron walked with a limp. This portrait of that man was all lame. <br /> <br /> I watched the two and a half hours waiting for something to come on in life. Not a creak, not even a glimmer. It was absolutely useless, if not even boring, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Having the opinion that no one will ever improve the Avon Bard, I also believe that Byron's poetry is over-painted and my mind should be thrown into oblivion, and this dramatization of his life should be accorded to same treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the BBC has lost its mind with this
