Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, one should simply read them. I agree. However, we love the adaptations of great literature and the strike of current writers makes me think that without good writers it is difficult for actors to bring their roles to life. Jane Austen's current version of PERSUASION shows us what happens when you don't have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version is not comparable to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which has been well interpreted and has retained the essence of the era and the restrictions on the characters (except for the bizarre parade and kisses in the street scene in Bath ) The 2007 version shows an ignorant Anne who seems distressed. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with some carefully chosen ones below. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel were completely tossed about, and Mrs Smith, Anne's hungry and impoverished classmate was walking in Bath - - chirping, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which led Anne to love him in the first place, does not appear to have been written in Rentert Penry-Jones's Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and was able to convey much more with a look, which P-J was able to do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel into a melodrama of torment, in hand, of questionable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they would have to do what they do with Shakespeare's adaptations: adapt it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was removed from the historical and local context and was fun to watch, as was "Clueless". This wasn't PERSUASION, but they didn't know what else to call it.
