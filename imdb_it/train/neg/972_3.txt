This was a disappointing horror movie about a snotty girl and her nightmares. For a horror or "thriller" movie and hype, it's too docile. There are only a few moments of tension here, not anywhere as close as possible to a film of this kind. Even those "tense" scenes weren't many. Music made them more dramatic than they really were. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of symbolism here, so elite critics define this "horror film of a thinking person". Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they'll come to the same conclusion I made - a waste of money in the video rental store. <br /> <br /> Summary: a yawn that offers an unlikely lead character and generally poor acting. Conspicuously overrated and certainly not what is advertised.
