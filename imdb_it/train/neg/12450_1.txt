Ten minutes of history told in the best part of two hours. When nothing significant happened halfway through, I should have left. But, still hopeful, I stayed. And left with a sense of guilt for wasting time. Acting was OK, but the plot is so transparent and weak. The script is almost as lame as it could get, but once again, lengthening the plot by ten minutes leaves little room for good dialogue.
