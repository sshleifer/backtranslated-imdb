With an endless interval of three hours and twenty minutes, "Salaam-e-Ishq" is a nice but superficial soap opera from India that gives us with six intertwined stories of romantic love (which is at least four too many stories in my opinion). <br /> <br /> Filmed as a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer spot, the film is a mixture of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, songs and dances with high numbers, sequences of dreams and fantasies, winking character traits, banal dialogues and comic performances in step with the times - all pretty common standard things when it comes to Bollywood events these days. It's a grueling job that tries to keep all the characters straight as they dance, strut and make their way through the incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> There is much to do for the spectator to trivialize his eyes here - not least of all all the falling and beautiful women - but he will need Job's patience to carry him through.
