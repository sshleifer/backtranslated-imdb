Christian Slater of 0 *, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Based on video game director Uwe Boll tries to recreate the game in an action-packed action nail, unfortunately he can't. Instead it makes one of the worst movies ever made! Although he gets minor celebrities like Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, his film lacks the necessary foundations that a film needs to be as good as a plot, and some basic relativity of what happens in darkness and light. The film bounces all around and Uwe Boll has no creative control. And not to mention the bad CGI used to create monsters. Even if they looked cool and the feedings were good, a little lame. Honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final vote 0/10.
