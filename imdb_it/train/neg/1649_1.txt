Every Sunday, a trio of gems meet in a restaurant in New York to boast of their sexual conquests of the night before. Sometimes they are joined by a newly born ex-partner and a hoochie hunter who grabs them like a barnacle. Horny dogs / corn dogs are disgusting and Mia, who has witnesses in search of prey, decides that they must learn a lesson, damn it. Ergo, it will come out with appointments, why not? All three! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical and bad girl. Women now have the right to go out and sleep around as much as they want. As much as men do, too! <br /> <br /> There is a laughable solitary element in "Whipped" - that is to say the fact that not once, during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bedfellows what a trash, the other customers do in the diner, turn around and say: "Friend, we're trying to EAT here". In fact, a gag heh-heh has an elderly woman who has a great interest in the useful sexual properties of certain drinks. A big fat Kermit the Frog "Sheesh" to this. <br /> <br /> It is really unfortunate that a friendly film with a fantastic atmosphere, a smart and pretty heroine and three possible pairings should have a finish like this. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 whip-oosh sound effects to the writer for the use of the phrase "You go, girl". He was tired in 2000, and now he is tired. <br /> <br /> Save your time and watch some replicas of "Sex and the City" ...
