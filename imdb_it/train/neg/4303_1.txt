The previous comment made me write this. He says that Muslims are blond and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment says only that this opinion can be made by racists. Look, the breed is nothing. I'm colorblind. I look like Pierce Brosnan but I'm not Irish. Then? I might add that I am not 100% Serbian, that I have Austrian and Croatian blood inside me, but what is the point. Am I dark, half-breed? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with such bad intentions as Lantos (producer and director is racist to me. Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Everything to hell, but that will not return our dead relatives.I'm proud to be Serbian and I'm proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes, I'm from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family). Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo, terrible terrorism of street gangs, Muslim extremism. I add: I kneel and pray for all the innocent Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox brothers and sisters killed in this war. This film is manipulation with our misery, the false humanitarianism that does not help at all. Help Lantos fill his pockets with more deer, all right!
