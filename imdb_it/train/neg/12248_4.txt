The only real highlight of the film is the death of the sniveling boy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it. <br /> <br /> In any other way, this film is a very lousy rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in. <br /> <br /> As is standard for a 90s horror film, the two non-protagonist women take off their clothes at least once. The female protagonist does not, since she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The entire film surrounds the filming of a really stupid extreme sport called "blood surfing", in which surfers cut themselves and sail in shark-infested waters. In this film, there is also a giant saltwater crocodile in the area. People are eaten. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I don't mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate a boring horror movie, which is definitely this.
