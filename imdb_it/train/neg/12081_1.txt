note to George Litman and others: the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "I don't think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> my favorite riff is "Why were you looking at her 'like'?", simply for complete nonsense. that, and "Well well not!" above all, I would say that we have to give credit to the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie. you can't really have much fun in the dialogue; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would deny it. a middle school theater club could do better. <br /> <br /> I would advise you to buy a book and read "Hamlet".
