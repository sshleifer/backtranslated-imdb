Warning: Avoid this terrible super-duper movie ... if you looked at it you would be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are at grandmother's age now what are they doing? Seeking SO HARD to be young innocent and sexy, it just doesn't work at all. Pam and Denise behave so horribly in this film. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the script is absolutely atrocious, I can't believe anyone could come up with such lousy ideas. With the development of the film industry, film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the last century. I bet even the movie goers of the last century will hate this. <br /> <br /> Stay away from me. I think watching "White Chicks" in 2004 is a lot better than this ... you weren't wrong at the time I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
