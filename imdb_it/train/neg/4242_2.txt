Guys, I love crime films full of action, shooting, chases and so on. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was disappointed after seeing this short and unsatisfactory movie. We have seen everything before, the hostages, the bank, the surroundings ... Yet, 2 villains who shoot down different officers and innocent people who simply remain in the line of fire - without being hit by some Kevlar. <br /> <br /> Not just a few clicks, no, hundreds of shots. Going back to the bank, where the stupid hostages didn't close the safe or the doors when the bad guys came out. How stupid he thought the director would be. <br /> <br /> Ok, the fake shots of a documentary were good, but after watching the movie I just thought: why didn't the police get a decent shooting course? And because there were so many cops and it was SWAT on a real long break. Really bad.
