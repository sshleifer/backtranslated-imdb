"Mistress of the Craft" Celeste works as an agent for the London branch of Interpol's Bureau 17, specializing in hidden criminals (I think). He possesses the Eye of Destiny, good in his hands, dangerous if others understand it. <br /> <br /> Bureau 17 has captured a California satanist, Hyde (no relationship with Dr. Jekyll). LAPD detective Lucy Lutz flies to England to bring him back to the United States. Lutz is the link to previous Witchcraft films, having been played by Stephanie Beaton before in Witchcraft 9. In part 7, Lutz was played by another woman; in 6, Lutz was a man! <br /> <br /> The part of Lutz in 9 was not terribly big, but he is one of the main stars in this one. Even if she left behind high heels and short skirts, she still has revealing tops in this one. And this time he has nude and sex scenes. Beaton is quite attractive in the role. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a number of sex scenes. An anonymous club-goer has a fatal trio with two vampires, the Satanist and the vampire leader take it out on some knot, Lutz finds an English friend, and Celeste and her boyfriend make love. <br /> <br /> The main recurring character in the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in this, although Lutz mentions it to Bureau agent 17 Dixon in a vampire conversation. He also calls his companion Detective Garner (parts 6, 7 and 9), although we do not hear his end of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Hyde is unleashed by a group of vampires led by Raven, for a Walpurgis ritual that has something to do with a god called Morsheba (I think). Hyde delivers all his lines very flat, while Raven goes to field level. The fighting scenes are terribly choreographed. <br /> <br /> The audio in the film was recorded rather badly, and poorly edited. Furthermore, some dialogues are lost under loud music or sirens. Even photography is not exceptional. Having the film set and shot in the UK was nevertheless a novelty, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Wendy Cooper is as good as Celeste; attractive, certainly, but above all it is easily the best actor of the film (despite the bad fight scenes). I'm quite surprised that his filmography is so small. If there is ever a Witchcraft XIV, and I bet it will, they should bring it back, even if it means wanting it in California! <br /> <br /> Witchcraft X is available on its own or in the Hotter Than Hell DVD collection along with Witchcraft XI and two independent films.
