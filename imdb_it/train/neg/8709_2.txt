Arg. The trailing dinosaurs are back to take another bite from our sanity in this terrible third movie. This time, the European terrorists (I would say Irish) hi-jack, an army convoy should carry uranium. They enter a shipyard, open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit when rubber dinosaurs chew on terrorists, policemen and some marines. The whole film seems to be (again) largely inspired by Alien (as was Carnosaur 2) with the pathetic marines that crossed the "claustrophobic" construction site? handy guns. This third opus is probably the driest and darkest film in the lot, with a single jet of blood when a rubber dino breaks a marine's head. Dinosaurs are stiff and blended creatures as usual and the T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the film's most awkward scenes is when the cops arrive: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and they hear strange noises coming from another truck. Opening it, surprise! The Reptile Rubber Gang explodes and devours them. Why were the dinosaurs locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first? How did they get stuck because the truck door could only be closed from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene ???? Oh, what a bother, who cares? Both thumbs down for oversized rubber iguanas.
