At first glance this documentary / fiction / comic is quite fun and challenging. Of course, when something causes thought, it can therefore be examined. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with insinuations and baseless conclusions. The connection that "What the Bleep ..." you would see between science and spirituality is not, in effect, rooted in science. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film argues that group meditation can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C. in this case. In reality the HRA crime rate (murders, rapes and assaults) was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in the murder rate during the study. In reality, every single affirmation that links metaphysics to science can and has been dispelled. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this film is a mediocre attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke. Anyway, I suggest you don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a long-term movie about thoughts that may cause thoughts, you might consider Mindwalk (1990).
