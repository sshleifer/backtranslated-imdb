I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it drives me crazy. If you watch the film before reading the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this film was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning may be similar but most aspects of the film are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it's extremely intense and Danny and Wendy run away a few seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible film version Jack how he takes them through a stupid maze ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry is that Jack just killed Mr. Halloran! what the hell, he's basically the hero of the book and they simply killed him as if it didn't matter. Overall, it was just bad that the film was so out of fashion.
