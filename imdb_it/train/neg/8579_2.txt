I'm afraid this is pretty terrible, despite the many good performances and generally competent management of acting for the camera. It is the first and last attempt by screenwriter and director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of the Canadian program to promote national film production. While the program encourages noteworthy efforts like "New Waterford Girl" opens the door to talented novices like Lyu who didn't have to aggressively launch this project, but was lit by green light without proper examination of the script or its credentials. <br /> <br /> You don't mind the low budget because the sloppy production design, poor lighting, poor audio and the squalid selection of docu-style shots are consistent with the topic; workers in Canadian massage parlors. But dialogue and conspiracy do not give the actors anything to work with, the publisher has so much to assemble, or a spectator any mental challenge as well as suspension of disbelief. When your story is so simplistic, the last thing you need is a fake narrative technique; even if nothing happens, the film is difficult to follow and the point of view impossible to define. <br /> <br /> The performance of Don McKellar as Conrad is of several notches below its similar characterization in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard empty head; as always it is nice but here is little else. Cindy of Kira Clavell is a pleasant surprise, a sort of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role of any consequence, Betty of Tara Spencer-Nairn in the street, nullifies her excellent performance in "New Waterford Girl". His superficial performance in "Rub and Tug" should limit any tendency to look for other films in which he appeared; unless further confirmation of "Waterford" director Alan Moyle's ability to work with young actors is needed. <br /> <br /> Quickly conclude that Lyu's reptilian brain cannot grasp concepts like the complexity of the plot, so the need to insert a lazy and lame "deus ex machina" device towards the end is hardly a surprise. . Still it could be worse, the wordless story has so little internal logic that the unlikely ending is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
