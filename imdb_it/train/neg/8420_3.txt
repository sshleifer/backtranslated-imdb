Despite the excellent cast, this is an insignificant film, especially from the point of view of aviation. It may be somewhat better than the egregia "von Richthofen and Brown" but not by much. "Blue Max" remains the best of a small market in the last 35 years while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to hypothesize what ILM could do with Zeppelin and Gothas in a new high-quality WW I aerodynamic film.
