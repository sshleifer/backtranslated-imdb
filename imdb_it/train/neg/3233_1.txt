Come on, you can't be serious, another case of sniff advertising when it's not at all! This is not even remotely frightening, nor terrifying or depraved - it's just an absolutely terrible amateur videogame, made for the next party to make girls do it. <br /> <br /> The blood is incredibly bad, even the eye -scene is far from making me want to vomit but just making me want to take the camera and hit those guys on the head. The girl is leaning there with her rubber face, she doesn't move at all. It would have been more fun to use a real doll instead. <br /> <br /> A "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!" season it's scarier than this. Don't waste time or money.
