I don't know what some of you are smoking, but I suspect it's powerful. <br /> <br /> Calling horrible Swept Away would be an insult to the very concept of terror. The acting is horrible and I'm not picking up Madonna here, we all know it's useless, but someone should have warned everyone else that her condition is contagious. It literally hurts my back for doing so much harm to poorly distributed lines. The assembly is so sloppy, it is a mendicant description. Photography and composition (which in this era, competence should be CALLED for any film with a budget) are surprisingly inept, even the lighting is horrible and unnatural. These are basic elements of cinema, if you can't do them well, you should look for another line of work. It is conceived as a production of Snow White of the third grade, except that for the rest it is not even remotely created or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original Lina Wertmueller film is a wonderful satire and metaphor, superbly recited and written, with breathtaking images - you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the wind-blown sand in your hair. The sexual tension seems real and immediate ... those of you who found the version of Guy Ritchie deplorable, should see it, is really one of the landmarks of world cinema. <br /> <br /> Those of you who thought about the remake are kind of a masterpiece that should have your head examined.
