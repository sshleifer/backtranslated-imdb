I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, because all American animators think that children nowadays want stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ??? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean come on !!! Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this piece of junk is just one example of stupid business decisions that just want to create an idiotic economic show that kids will love because hey! ! ! kids love superheroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time in which we see the new versions of Looney Tunes but this time in the form of superheroes, this doesn't seem too bad, but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like Batman the animated series , or the new league of justice, the result ??? bad copies of flash (the road runner) or superman (who else bug bug bunny) the problem is that the Looney Tunes weren't made to be dramatic, they had to be fun !!!! as I said before this series sucks, and many people wonder why souls are taking hold all over the world ??? this show tries to be dramatic and full of action, but it is something that few series and souls are able to do, if you want to see a good update of an old show, Tiny Toons, this is an example that you can bring back old people characters, but with a good story and respecting the original roots. pity the show is already dead, I suppose it's a wise decision.
