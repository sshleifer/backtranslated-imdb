Oh my God, what a horrible movie. The film has all the right people, unfortunately not worth watching. I saw it for free in my local library. If I had paid to see it, I would be even more upset. This film is unwatchable. How could Tarintino be involved in a film so slow and unexciting. No wonder he hasn't had much distribution, everyone involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated camera and my big toe. It's beyond boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just left me standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Don't worry about this movie. If someone suggests you look at it, kill them.
