...... in a horror movie that is. Okay, first, let's start with Kate. Among his main objectives are George Clooney's fuck, which looks good and, last but not least, ruined everyone. You must love it. He had about 3 surprisingly good chances to finish this sicko but ..... instead he ran. I mean he didn't want to take Guy out for 10 minutes and when he did it was too late. I mean the boy tried to rape her. I can't get into these films where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean honestly he would have some sympathy for a guy who ends up all those he meets overnight. The film kept going on. And consequently it has lost all its credibility.
