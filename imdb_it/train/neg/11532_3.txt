I rented this movie the other night because neither I nor my girlfriend had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a mutual friend how "fantastic it was". <br /> <br /> Now, I am rather conservative in my point of view, but I knew that entering would have been rather liberal, given who directed it. I imagined that before the film started, Michael Douglas would play a compassionate liberal popular loved by the masses and there would be a heavy conservative opponent like his antagonist. But I thought that was where the political declaration would begin and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot was solid: the single president falls for a lobbyist. OK, this has a potential that I thought was pretty funny, since the plot was unique. But then the film turned into a liberal infomercial. The film has become more focused on arms control and environmental issues than the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). <br /> <br /> There have been many ridiculous aspects in this film: 1) The Sydney character who plays this six figure lobbyist who is a "closer". Could it have been more fickle? She was constantly disorganized and seemed amazed at everything. Hardly a "closer". I'm a salesman, and she couldn't "close" by selling a glass of water to a man who dies of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss who plays a fanatic of the right? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and plays a right-wing ideologue. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made it as sinister as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech was simply ridiculous in the end. The joke on "I am proud of the ACLU" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit such a thing, being an active member of an ultra-marginal group. Second, why even bring something like this. You've just alienated yourself for half the movie audience who are moderate or conservative. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was exceptional and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film has gone from being a "movie" to a political declaration of the left, which is why the film failed. It is a pity to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood to force their political opinions to the public
