Just like "ITS A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD" is at the top of my list for all the most beautiful comedies ever made, that's it at the bottom. (Of course, I could be wrong - not having seen "SAVING SILVERMAN") In other words, it is a lame comedy, lame, lame, lame. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * up ** ***
