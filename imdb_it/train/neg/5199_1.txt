In the first 20 minutes, every possible cliché was pulled out of the scribbler and the director. There was the NTSB primary investigator with tortured family life; the politically tortured NTSB council member played by [I can kill ANY TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of an accident victim; and the torturous deranged lawyer who pursues the ambulance. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still has no idea of ​​aircraft fragility. The crashed plane was a 737 and was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippopotamus who decided to take a nap. The first third of the fuselage was intact, the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines. Most people should have left in the light of how many people survived that plane that was destroyed in Iowa after losing hydraulics. Most of this TV plane wasn't even burned. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of the scene in "Air Force One" where the 747 hits the water and then jumps along as if it were made of steel an inch thick. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it could not be seen. Even my wife, who accepts more than me, was commenting on technical defects. What surprised me is how this POS can ever be realized. Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them? Someone read this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million dollars to make it real. I would like to be the boy's next date. I have the title of a wonderful bridge in New York that I would sell cheaply.
