The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion, the historical teases are not. I realize that this is a work and not a documentary, but some important aspects are missing, in particular if other people falsely comment because of this. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation, which was staged and reorganized due to the discovery on board the ship, in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons, one of which was Samir Kuntar , a hateful terrorist whose story can be found by searching on "klinghoffer samir kuntar" on google. Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations, although he never set foot on the Achile Lauro. Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC, did he? <br /> <br /> *** possible spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The film almost excuses the actions and reactions of the terrorists because of the horrors they could have lived, always accentuating and exaggerating what they have made the Israelis to hurt them. However, they never describe the wound the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis. The film uses images (quite horrendous !!!) from the horror of Sabra and Chatila, and nothing is said, underestimating the general belief that it was Israel that was responsible, never mentioning that it was a Lebanese army of Syrian origin that it led The acting was generally bad, but I think that's what you can expect from opera singers? <br /> <br /> On another note, I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists by killing a hostage because the hostage tried to shake up the 400 innocent hostages against armed terrorists, adding that the person did not it should be considered comprehensive because it is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how unpleasant his wife was, spitting out the terrorists who shot her husband and threw her body into the sea. I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is (a wink winks)
