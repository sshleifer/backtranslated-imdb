OK, so I'm a fan of original Wicker Man and usually I don't like American films redone by the Americans, so why oh why did I go through the most painful cinematic experiences ever? Am I not a Nicolas Cage fan and maybe I had a kind of crazy moment? The film was terrible! The bit at the beginning of the crash / fire had no relevance to the film and the cop knew where Edward was going, so a little at the end with the two girls who visited the mainland, well, it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would been investigated. The story behind the wicker man has not really been explored - and I believe that being set in America has not really helped the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I have to say that the best part was just at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I have such a desperate need to review the original now, to purify my disappointed soul. I can't really stress how disappointing this film is, please don't see it if you: <br /> <br /> A) You don't like British Films B embroiderers B) I'm a fan of the original C) I hate Nicolas Cage
