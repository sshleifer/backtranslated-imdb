Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wonderful special effects that fall directly into the trash. <br /> <br /> Dirty direction and performance (except for the adorable Annabel Schofield who is much prettier than a brunette and who probably deserves better material, and the always honest Charlton Heston) earns the evaluation of a real stinker. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see Heston perform at the usual level and show how ugly this movie is. He even plays in a sub plot that made me interested only to see how it connected to the main line of the film. The way they ended up solving it was that they didn't. It simply falls to the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Don't waste time with this.
