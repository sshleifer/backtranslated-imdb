as an actor, I really like independent films, but this is amateur at best. <br /> <br /> The boys go to Vermont for a civilian service but when the plane lands over a palm tree - were the directors aware that the palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same goes for the wedding service - again a beautiful palm grove. <br /> <br /> When the boys are leaving VT, apparently they could not get a ticket for any of the major airlines because the plane being turned is Federal Express. Did they send themselves overnight in a box? From the little guys little details like this separate a movie from totally amateur. <br /> <br /> The Christian brother is much more gay than Arthur with his faded hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have exchanged roles. <br /> <br /> Minor characters are ridiculous and do something terrible. <br /> <br /> Applause to the directors for making a gay movie but pay attention to your positions and launch next time
