I'm really starting to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how bad his movies can get. This particular film was a complete and total waste of time. My first complaint was the DVD cover where they took care of his photo and made him look thinner and younger when it looks like crap in the film. He has his big belly in the pot and the double chin that goes towards him and the most sad and bored expression. <br /> <br /> All the plot It was ridiculous to start with and pulled out too long. The whole movie was leading to the finale where Seagal and his team had to face a group of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer. There was also too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals' voice even in the middle of a sentence. The voice doubled like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical. <br /> <br /> fight scenes in the movie were horrible. Starting when Seagal foug You couldn't even see what was happening. There would be tight shots of him waving his arms towards the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something. He remembered the old Kung Fu series on television. They used the mode too slow for the fight scenes. <br /> <br /> I think this is the worst Seagals movie to date and I'm glad I didn't buy this movie or I would have been very upset since I'm a big fan of Seagal the Aikidoist. The star of the action is quickly fading and seems to be getting worse with every performance.
