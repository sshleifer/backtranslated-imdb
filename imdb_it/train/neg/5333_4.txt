A lousy mess posing like a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull riding champion who leaves the rodeo for a home stay in his people's desert in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the herd of cattle in the family (which desperately needs a stallion) . What the director Peter Tewksbury desperately needs is some narrative skills, even if what he misses in the evaluation makes up for in sloppy comic edits (his social commentary is not exactly pointed, but Tewksbury has a satirical twist to his bizarre and there are some funny scenes). Despite the colorful support turns of Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general strangeness gets out of hand, and there is too much anxiety and insecurity to sustain much interest. As for Elvis, he's relaxed and lively everywhere - and while it's nice to see him having fun on the screen, one has to wonder if he'd just given up on the movies at this point. This mess of a photo has a distinctive feel, and even if the spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. * 1/2 from ****
