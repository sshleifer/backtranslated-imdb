First of all, I'm honest. I haven't seen this whole movie. I watched the first five minutes and when I realized I was almost asleep I decided that I could also go ahead and see if it would become more interesting later ... It didn't happen. This film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story that is already uninteresting and badly told in something that never would have become: a decent horror movie. Because I think it's important to say that even a film with poor special effects can still be good if it's well done. This film is not and will only put you in a deep sleep if you try to watch it. Finally, I think it is important to say that I think this film is in the public domain, so if you think you absolutely have to watch it online, it will definitely show you a place where you won't have to pay to watch this pile of movie dung.
