This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, I told the boy from Blockbuster that they should have taken him off the shelves. The only interesting thing about this film is the box. On the box is written "by the bogeyman director", so I thought ... eh whatever, if it was made recently I am sure that at least the director will not be TOO bad: -, but after seeing the movie and he looked at what "boogeyman" they were talking about, it's a nonsense of the early 80s that he did. Great way to sneak in with unsuspecting spectators. <br /> <br /> HOWEVER, I think they liked the name "Zodiac Killer", and they didn't bother to research any of Zodiac's crimes or his MO, or even the years he was active. All the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the Zodiac and the "stories" about the original Zodiac take place several years after the crimes of the Zodiac. They also compare the Zodiac with "Vampire of Dusseldorf" Fritz Haarman throughout the film and talk quite often with Fritz's "son". The Zodiac and the Haarman were nothing like that, and it makes more sense to compare it to BTK who also shot people, not a man who killed people by chewing on their necks. None of the Haarman facts is correct, just a bunch of nonsense nonsense. His son also says "Don't forget, his name was Fritz Haarman with 2 t" ... His real name has one! I think the writer / director simply entered a google search for serial killers and the fastest ones that came up were Zodiac Killer and Fritz Haarman. "Ooh those look like interesting names, we make a movie about them without doing any external research! Great idea!" <br /> <br /> Perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this film is the way the killer describes the suffering of the DSM-IV and takes care of it. "I have also been diagnosed with DSM-IV and have since recovered", etc. For those of you who don't know, DSM-IV is the psychological manual for mental disorders. If someone suffers from the book itself then they must have SERIOUS problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> However, my point is that this goes to the bottom of my best 5 worst films of all time, and it is rare that a film ever arrives at that point. But, if you are interested in watching a story that is totally not based on serial killers that seems to be nothing but boring, full of inexperienced actors, and not completely rational, I'd say watch this movie. <br /> <br /> ... Oh, and I liked the way the "tear gas" killer some of his victims with dry ice. Nice touch ...
