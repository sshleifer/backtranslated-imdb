In recent years Swedish action films have evolved into something that mimics American indefatigable action films like "Heat" but on a low budget. This film follows the same prescriptions as "Noll Tolerans" and "Livvakterna". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a good and tough film. <br /> <br /> The plot has been seen before, the dialogue seems artificial and the acting is very poor, especially by the main actress. The film tries to paint a picture of military-style robbers without remorse and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts in a completely rational way. It doesn't do very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish photographic style does not seem fresh anymore and in this image it is not even well done. Only very few scenes are really beautiful. Moreover, the sound is rather strange and it seems that many of the actual dialogues are recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, although it is not a convincing portrait of a leading SWAT team, it has some really fun lines. Moreover, the music is quite good.
