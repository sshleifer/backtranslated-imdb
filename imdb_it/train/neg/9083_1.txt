It was so terrible. It wasn't fun to watch. Even the scene where the girl uses a vibrator is also not fun to watch in this movie. Again, the scene where a girl masturbates with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie you watched, just a girl on the couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have released that scene in theaters, maybe the movie would have been fun at some level. My advice, go fast up to that point, watch it, rewind the film, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could have fun for 2 hours this way. This film ranks alongside my grave and the Doom generation in the worst movie category I've ever seen.
