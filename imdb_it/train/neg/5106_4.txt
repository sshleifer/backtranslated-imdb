ALIEN LOVE (as this film is known in Britain) is a very strange film. I don't mean it's an esoteric house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman, I mean it's a TVM with bad words, sex, some really good T & A's, a bad script and a very retro vibe. You can only imagine someone like John Hughes who ran it ten years earlier, although of course he would cut the T & A <br /> <br /> Going back to the bad script, one of the problems is that some of the characters have any kind of motivation, in particular Amanda. Why do you pick up Connie at the bar? Only then could he meet an alien? Do you understand what I mean by backside? ET, SHORT CIRCUIT and a lot of other films from the mid-80s had this type of plot with most of them more defined and convincing than the one seen here. The plot continues to follow a poorly defined, unconvincing and illogical path <br /> <br /> Having said that, I found the ALIEN LOVE accessible and not just for the T & A on display. Like a sci-fi sexual comedy, it is much better than MEAT JESUS ​​AND EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY
