An absolutely miserable waste of film !! Nothing ever happens No ghosts, almost no train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a group of people stuck in the middle of nobody, because their train was blocked for less than 3 minutes. What? And doesn't the railway leave them a place to stay, in a strong storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can walk four miles through the dead black fields. umm, yes sure. Or they can force themselves to host the railway and stay at the "haunted" train station. A station that turned out to be nothing but DEADLY BORING, completely without ghosts, interests or plot. <br /> <br /> So terribly boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the list of LOST FILMS !! aargh !!
