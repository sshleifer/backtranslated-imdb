a friend of mine bought this (very cheap) and decided to give it to me as a birthday present. I thought I would never watch it because I knew it was a joke and the DVD cover looked pathetic, but then my friends and I got really bored and watched it. from start to finish! I know a good result but it is really a masterpiece. it's hard to describe. you should see it, it is a real lesson about what people are capable of when they believe they are creative and intelligent and in reality they are not. The "acting" is sous-terrain (on some occasions you can see the "protagonist" laughing, it is certainly the worst). the "story" is stupid to summarize and really everything in this film sucks. please pay special attention to "the sheriff". the boy is an adult and therefore has absolutely no excuse for being involved in this. he too is extremely bad. whatever has had some hilarious moments. take a look, haha
