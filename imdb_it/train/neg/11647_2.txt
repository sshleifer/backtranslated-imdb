CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino; an Italian dramatic film partially filmed in Hamburg, Germany. An easily forgotten film. Even in spite of a good sequence of car chases, this film seems almost pointless. A new Don takes control of a powerful mafia family and finds himself fighting for his life. The unwritten laws and the ethics of the mafia code make it difficult to trust anyone, especially when millions of dollars are at stake. Brutality and violence generate the same result. This can't be put on a shelf with the real epics of the gangsters. Only the appearance of the film brings to mind the American drive-in rate. Even the famous American actor Telly Savalas is unable to reinforce the caliber of this dramatic crime. Antonio Sabato also plays in: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia.
