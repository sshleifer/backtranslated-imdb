This film started well, I felt like I was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Very quickly I started to question the situations and actions of the main characters, and I found no answers as to why they were doing what they were doing. All the acting was superb, but only some scenes had brief moments when they were actually fun. Dan Cortese was fantastic. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie to casting agents. Watch the first scenes and then find something better, otherwise you'll find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found it in a basket in a video store. It cost me two dollars and, because of the rarity of this film, it seems like a good price.
