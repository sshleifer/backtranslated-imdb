One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was "how can I get my money from Hollywood Video". This does not apply to four dollars or dollars. I think it was an attempt to snatch The Mexican, or the Vin Diesel movies, but it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible, I was sorry for the actors who couldn't find anything better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling the lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the protagonist was exaggeratedly exaggerated, worse than a cartoon. <br /> <br /> Jump.
