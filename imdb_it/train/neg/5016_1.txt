The name of Nick Stahl, the young cast and the attractive cover of the VHS made me buy and watch this film, expecting to see a good movie on teen slash. How disgusting! The fullness of the clich√© script, the dialogues and the performances are horrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, horrendous ?? summing up, a complete waste of time. There is no horror, black humor, just an absolutely boring story, with shameful plot points. The film begins with six characters, or rather three couples, together as a group of friends, but in reality very unpleasant people who seem to be enemies, playing a ridiculous game without meaning called "Taboo", and with each of them writing yes or no for some taboo problems. That is: no previous development of the characters, the viewer does not know who they are, their motives and their relationships. Then there is an ellipse a year later, and the same group is reunited in a New Year's party, insulting each other in a very sordid way. But the plot and the turns are so ridiculous, predictable, mediocre and unbelievable that they don't deserve any additional line in my review. One tip: don't waste your time or money on this garbage, you'll surely regret it. My vote is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Taboo ?? Jogando Com or Assassin" ("Taboo ?? Playing With the Killer")
