Ohhh man! This is what I'm talking about! As for the bad / bad taste horror films, this film was really of a class of its own. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First of all, the film was not originally in English. Okay because vocal dubbing was really great! Here is my favorite extract from the dialogue (and there are many others where it comes from) ?? "I feel a little better, I'm just thirsty? FOR YOUR BLOOD!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a summary of the game of interaction between military and scientists ?? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Scientist: "You can't do it? It will be a disaster!" - Military officer: "It's just science fiction" (then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just as predicted by the scientist). <br /> <br /> Scene 2 ?? Scientist: "If you do, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "you don't know what you're talking about". (he does and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Scientist: "Don't do it, it will kill everyone!" - Military officer: "What nonsense" (then proceeds to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you have an idea). <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough ?? there were some scenes that stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the army has literally 10 guys pointing their guns at two unarmed men. The boss screams "Go get them!" and all 10 army types, one at a time, leave their weapons and punch the two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And don't worry. No attention to details has been omitted! This film also had an 80's / upbeat keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And trust me ?? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic that I just scratched the surface. A film of this caliber only comes out once every ten years! A real movie viewing experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
