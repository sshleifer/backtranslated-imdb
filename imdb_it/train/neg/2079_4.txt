I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman: I love Evolution and who didn't like Ghostbusters? From the trailer you already know that the character of Uma will be downloaded by Luke. So the build-up is obviously towards the time when she shoots her superpowers on him. But the pay-off is not there. The launch of the shark managed to get a (slight) chuckle, but again, it was all in the trailer. <br /> <br /> No one has the crowded breath like Uma and Luke is an Owen diet in his beautiful days. If it were not for Riann Wilson, he would sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks start to cramp. This is a comedy, isn't it? <br /> <br /> It is not horrible - it sits right there like a stale cracker behind the fridge. This may have been a brilliant submission of Superhero movies and feminism, but fails on both counts. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
