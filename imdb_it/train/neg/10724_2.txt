this is the perfect example of something fantastic that goes terribly wrong ... so, can I advise anyone to watch it? well, I was a little forced by the fact that he was in the tiff competition (I still can't believe he won) .. and I was alone until the end because the director was there for a section of q & a..but which was also far from interesting .. what is it? well, the first part (it's worth to see one) has three characters: a prostitute, a musician and a sort of officer ... the first two lies about their professions ... but the third is the real liar .. the second half (do something Else, don't spoil a good evening) include some old breasts and heavy drinks ... but maybe you'll see it completely different ... the tiff's jury did (were they drinking vodka?)
