Sergio Leone runs in his grave ... If there was a film that tramples the life of a man, this is his job. The bravado of the protagonist's "lone wolf" is uninteresting and lame, and the script was apparently written by an ape with an education of eight degrees. Anyone who has an idea should be whipped on horseback. The only reason I'm wasting my time is because there is a minimum of 10 lines. Sergio Leone's family should sue, not because it is crap, but because it is now immortalized as shit by the MST 3000. Shame. Disgust. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey sucks that he doesn't offend anyone but cocaine users and weapons experts ... this movie is pure blasphemy.
