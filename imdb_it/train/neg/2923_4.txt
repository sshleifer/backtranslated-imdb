The plot was quite interesting, with the background of the Russian revolution. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest because the film was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry between the 2 main characters, so it was difficult to believe the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirkland was really stiff, almost cold. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so he looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally find out who was after them, was rather weak and made absolutely no sense. I think I would have liked this film very much if the relationship between the two actors was slightly more credible.
