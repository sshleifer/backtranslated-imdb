There are films that are horrible, and there are such terrible films that they have long been forgotten and unwatchable. Also, a lot of violence and bad things (not just stuff like that, you know what I mean) also add to the mix. What is the result of bad films with such vulgar content? Why, "Giustizia Finale", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker starred in that film, and was filmed by Joel and the Bot on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Now this time, with Mike taking over from Joel on the Satellite of Love (but with the same robots), that trio made fun of Joe Don Baker's second film of MST3K, "Final Justice". Of course, most of the bad things I mentioned were removed for the television release, but anyway, I want to see that episode (and even "Mitchell"), why what does Joe "hate" the most? Why, none other than "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If there are many lots nearby, check that store for the uncut tape! LOL This happened to another user!
