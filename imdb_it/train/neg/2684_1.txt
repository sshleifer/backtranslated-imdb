I found the film offensive to Americans who lost someone in the towers, for Americans in general. Pretending to be a tribute to horrific events that have occurred in recent years, each director takes the opportunity to argue with ancient facts (which have nothing to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American political behavior, or compare different political situations as they have in their own country that has nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11th. Shame on them.
