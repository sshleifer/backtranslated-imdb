A cast of movie stars and TV series from the 1980s (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among others) in the story of a photographer who dreams of killing his models. Obviously the models and other people begin to appear dead causing all sorts of complications. <br /> <br /> The not-too-good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough material to generate real interest. This is best described as the type of film that gave the Cinemax cable channel the alternative name of Skinamax. I really can't see the point of looking at this unless it's necessary to see every bleak thriller out there. (I must also say that this film is full of smoke, to the point that it becomes ridiculous when someone turns on)
