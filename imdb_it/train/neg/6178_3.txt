"The Home Front" by Frank Tashlin is one of Private Snafu's quieter short films, a series of cartoons made as educational films for the military. Instead of making Snafu undertake some reckless actions that lead to disaster, "The Home Front" focuses instead on his loved ones at home and on what they have to offer to the war effort. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought it was easy. It is a concept with few chances to make good gags and instead Tashlin plays the most daring card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and bobbing girls dressed very effectively. The result is a well-intentioned short film that has little relevance or entertainment value today other than a historical artefact.
