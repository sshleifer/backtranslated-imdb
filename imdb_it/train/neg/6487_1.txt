Well, thanks a LOT of Disney for DESTROYING the good memories I used to have my first favorite movie. I was about 5 years old when the original film came out, and it was one of the first movies I remember seeing. So, now that I'm 16 and I feel pretty masochistic, I decided to rent this movie. So, I managed to poison all my memories of the original film with this sorry excuse for a movie. This film takes everything that made the original captivating and destroys it, down to the last detail. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show them all in the ocean ... NARROW STYLE! After the musical number ends, in a few minutes, the marine witch Morgana shows up and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. Thus, he surrenders without even fighting. Eric remains open-mouthed, even though Ariel understands how to use a sword and save Melody. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that Melody should never approach the sea until Morgana is captured. <br /> <br /> Well ... uh, nothing important really happens. Eric is a real fan. He can never really do anything. Ariel does something. The melody can ruin everything. Furthermore, animation is a new weak point for Disney. Computer graphics come up against backgrounds. A single opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, don't waste time. I'm pretty sure even small children will be bored by their skull with this, since nothing exciting never happens even remotely. They won't want to sing the songs. If you can get a copy, throw it in the ocean and hope no one ever finds it. Never.
