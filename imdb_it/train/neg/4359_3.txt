Wow, after ruining the Timo Roses album "Rout City" after about 15 minutes (South Park is more than a meaningless curse ... I guess some people don't understand it) I was interested in this movie. I read some positive things and the packaging and appearance of the film seemed far from the total garbage that I expected after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: the film is not total garbage, but the problem seems to be exactly what Timo Rose tries to follow in the footsteps of the German cinema Horror / Splatter as Olaf Ittenbach and the like. This means that "Barricade" is in part extremely bloody and detailed. FX gores are not really credible but OK, acting is OK but in some cases it's just crap. The hilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and does not improve until it has fired. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is gory, has a typical German underground atmosphere (including the classic bloodshed), OK FX and a modern twist like the already promised package? ! <br /> <br /> 1. The script is total BS. Get a typical hillbilly / lost in the woods story with some guys + gal camping and meeting a family of degenerate hillbilly. Everything is only leading towards the scenes of torture / mutilation and seems incredibly casual and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" unconvinced. <br /> <br /> 2. Random is also the perfect description for much of the camera work (I liked the repetitive tweezers in the extended torture scene ... or they had no material or the editor works in a ironmongery). Worse still editing ... sure, it's modern and far better than many other films of the genre but it's RANDOM. You overuse that typical display effect everywhere and without meaning ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there is a grainy / noisy film that is also thrown here and there for the sake of it, I don't have the meaning. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the effects mentioned above, there are many repetitive things here. For example, most killings are modified with multiple repetitions of stabs and stabs. Okay once, but here it is annoying and false, especially towards the end. Annoyingly it also attributes the "music" that is used permanently without any changes in the background. It doesn't take long before the film becomes hardly bearable. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this comes the biggest problem of this film (and many others in my opinion). If you make a film splatter with the trash it feels rather idiotic to polish it with special effects and new modifications to the school. They seem to take it too seriously. It's not funny because the decent FX gores are simply wasted in this context. And where the Gore FX classics are OK, the FX computer in scenes like stabs in the mouth or shots in the finale seem rather stupid (and the 3D splatter sucks me out especially in films with a budget and decent 3D artists). /> <br /> I've often wondered if the time of the splatter movies is over and "Barricade" is just another example it might be time to put it in the grave. It is not funny, it has no character and it is too shabby for its appearance. The script is an economic proof of "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" which lead absolutely nowhere. You can take it literally ... the ending is there and random like many other things here ("I love you" in a splatter movie ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to incorporate a lot and fails ... you can surely go on in this film for a long fainting, an acidic face that melts, a nipple from nipple and a classic cut of the 13th style of a couple while fingering a tent (bloody) boobies hooray!). But it's really hard to do it. Total failure mainly because you can see that it could have been something.
