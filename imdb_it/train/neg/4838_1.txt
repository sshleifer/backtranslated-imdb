I decided to watch this because it was nominated for an Oscar this year. I imagine that many people here really wanted to appreciate this movie, but I ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene went well, but the rest of the film in "shaking hands" mode is really annoying. <br /> <br /> I think the main reason for making a film like this and nominating it for an Oscar is this: <br /> <br /> The American "military machine" (people who make money in war) urgently need an excuse or justification for the war in Iraq, putting together something (something) patriotic. <br /> <br /> why these "heroic" efforts of the director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of ​​"loving war as a drug"? .. Oh, please, let's go! how boring! <br /> <br /> look at this to get an idea of ​​how low the cinema academy can fall ...
