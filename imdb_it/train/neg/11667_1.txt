This film was a great disappointment for the director, the intellectual niveau, the plot and the way he approached the theme, painting. It is a film that moves slowly like an episode of Wonder Years, with a frightening lack of depth. He also fails to convey his message convincingly. <br /> <br /> The approach to the subject of painting is very elitist, limited to vague and subjective terms such as "beauty". According to the creators of this film, "beauty" can only be experienced in Bob-Ross style kitsch landscape paintings. The good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic color theory (like primary school) and many feelings. In some parts the film is offensive, eg at a certain point it is stated (indeed, celebrated by dancing on the tables) that people with mental handicaps are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting, their works are by definition useless "bullshit" (quotation). <br /> <br /> I don't understand how the film can get such a high score, so again, not many people have rated it, and have only chosen very high or very low ratings.
