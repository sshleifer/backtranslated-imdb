This lower sequel based on characters created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer) concerns a marriage named Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). Adopt a girl named Delia from a convent. Gene York talks about being re-elected for the deputy and chairing the financial committee. Meanwhile, Delia seems to be around when unexplained deaths occur. It creates upheaval when it makes a metaphysical fair, like the reserves of numerology, therapy, therapy, yoga, tarot, among others are destroyed. Karen York takes a private eye (Michael Lerner) to investigate bizarre and bizarre events. <br /> <br /> This TV sequel shows chills, chills, gruesome events and bloody killings. Delia, like Damien, seems to send new mysterious murders every few minutes of a movie, horrible murders happening. The main excitement is to see which innocent new victim can be produced by mediocre special effects. Furthermore, mediocre protagonists, Faye Grant and Michael Woods, as beautiful as a secondary cast, like Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and Don S Davis, who died recently, was an army captain turned into acting. As always, excellent soundtrack taken from Omen I and III by the great Jerry Goldsmith. The film is exclusively for hardcore Omen saga followers. The film is poorly directed by Jorge Montesi and Dominique Othenin Girard. The previous and much better versions are the following: Richard Donner's immensely original superior "Omen" (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick); 'Damien' (William Holden, Lee Grant) by Don Taylor; "Final Conflict" (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow) by Grahame Baker. Evaluation: below average.
