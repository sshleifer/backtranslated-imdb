Celia Johnson is a good nurse. Michael Hordern is as good as Capulet, although he is his usual neigh and neigh and not a stain on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse of Frate Laurence well even if he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is as good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is comprehensive. <br /> <br /> The sets are beautiful, if not stunning as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's all. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire turned 15 during production, and has no idea how to play Juliet - she opens her eyes broadly and plagues each row exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is ill-balanced with her, and his respect for himself is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and without incident with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their deaths are a relief. If I had a dagger, I would have offered them hours before. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unspeakable as Mercutio, a great shock if you remember his excellent work in "Brideshead Revisited". It breaks the mirror of Shakespeare's verse in a thousand fragments of two or three words each, and then shouts the fragments in the most disconnected and incomprehensible way possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Terrible. <br /> <br /> The director, Alvin Rakoff, shows only an intermittent gift of putting the camera where he will show what we want to see. The opening brawl is remarkably inconsistent. However there is humor when in a subsequent fight, Romeo apparently kneels Tybalt right in the shoemakers. Tebaldo then seizes the region offended. Anyway, has it passed? <br /> <br /> R & J is a long representation. This version is not recommended for classroom use or much more.
