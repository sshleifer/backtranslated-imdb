I saw Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other beautiful works from the blaxploitation canon of our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always have a special place in my heart. Out of pure nonsense, poor film production skills and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), The Human Tornado cannot be surpassed. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old friend Dolemite is piling up with a white woman, when some local racist cops broke into the house for no good reason, and you wouldn't know! The woman in bed with Ol 'Dole is none other than the wife of the sheriff. His crying when he sees it: "He made me do it!" Dolemite's cry: "& $ * @ $ you are real ???" Subtlety has never been his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of the fame of Ghostbusters), the errors of continuity (the characters look on one side in one shot and the other in the next, the suit of Dolemite changes color in every single shot of its nightclub act ), and the demonic of Queen Bee eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he was cool in this movie? I certainly don't know why, but you have to admire the pure enthusiasm he has. Whether you jump completely naked from a cliff, or order to bark at his rhyme (ex: Quick! Into the cave! I have a plan to let this mother $ * @ (% and dig his grave!) is committed Certainly he goes overboard, never again that at any time he is doing kung fu. The culminating battle is filmed at high speed, but occasionally slows down to allow Rudy to pose and grit his teeth. them how they accelerated the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe it was so fast. In any case, "The Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, very similar to the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions, but at least it's fun, and you certainly have to give these people credit for the effort, but not so much.
