You can never have seen either of the two films and still know that The Jerk Too is a disaster. The question is not, "How was it done," because if you throw money at someone and tell them to make a movie, they will. <br /> <br /> No. The question is "Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow it to be built?" I think he needed money to fight an annoying cause and it was determined that it didn't cost him anything. He knew the following would be so scary, that out of pride, he would not even consider his rights as income. <br /> <br /> The only way this sequel could not be an embarrassment is to have Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family. <br /> <br /> And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It is simply obvious that you worked on this film with too much capacity, and the only way to feel better about your involvement is to be the lone cheerleader of the sequel as a comment from an IMDb user. I was praying for you to turn to satire, but alas, you were really making an effort. Why not 10 stars?
