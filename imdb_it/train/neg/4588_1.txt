I created my reality by walking outside the theater where I was tied by my girlfriend to go into this state of discomfort with her mother. We (my friend and I) went out for about an hour. What a pseudo scientific new age jargon. <br /> <br /> Are secondary atomic particles thoughts? Recorded labels with water bottles and blessed him by a Buddhist monk, did you grow beautiful crystals? A 25% drop in the DC homicide rate happened when a group of people meditated. Wow, what a rigorous scientific study. I'm sure someone ate cheerios for four days straight at the same time. Should we conclude that eating cheerios has caused a decrease in the murder rate? <br /> <br /> Hogwash, hooey, bull pucky! <br /> <br /> BTW- It was funded by the Ramtha cult, whose leader was one of the "experts" interviewed by the directors. No further reason here, right?
