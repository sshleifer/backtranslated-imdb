I wish I could say that this show was unusual in its banality, but it's normal anyway. He has the silent husband, his most intelligent but boring and conventional wife, along with the idiotic assistant for the "comic" relief - he desperately needs it. There are predictable jokes, with even more predictable reactions to laughter, dot the lines of nauseatingly deceptive plot of the mental narcotic to leave me either physically ill, or in a deep sleep more like that of an induced coma. But it could still be for a while because it gives the average American a character they can truly identify with. A "normal" guy like you and me. I live in the southern United States, so for me this show is just the opposite of escapism. Here, that hateful character is everywhere, in one form or another. Watching it on television is a brutal excess.
