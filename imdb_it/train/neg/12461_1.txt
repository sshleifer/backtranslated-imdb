Contrary to most of the other comments on "Syriana" on the IMDb website, my family and I found this DVD movie at home a complete waste of time and space. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a film based on a script whose author was far too clever. Rather than trying to tell a complex story intelligently and clearly, it was assumed that the launch continued mostly vague and difficult to connect with each other with 30-second vignettes of different narrative lines from a dozen "stories" line "to the public has made an excellent vision. No, sir, it's not like that. What makes the vision great is the total clarity, precision, story lines - and characterizations - that have a beginning, a center and an end. <br /> <br /> This type of film presentation - similar to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent to the extreme. <br /> <br /> Thank goodness, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British noir films of the 40s and 50s whose writers, director and actors knew the value of clear narrative , of diction and acting that meant something. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD in which this family will not be sitting again.
