I just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here you won't be able to understand how awful this movie is, even though it must be one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen! I've never bothered posting a comment here before, but this piece of shit really justifies it. <br /> <br /> First of all the whole plot is ridiculous and meaningless. Brother of the main character (or Ben or Arthur, forgetting which he is, and frankly it is never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is aberrant for Christians, but apparently the murder of mass is not t. Then there is some other shit thrown on one of the ex-couples of the gay couple that tries to force him to remarry with the gun. This does not lead to anything, but it does provide us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "movie" - "Doesn't it make sense? You don't make sense! That's who makes sense!" Brilliant. <br /> <br /> Then there's acting, which is just atrocious. It must be seen to be believed. My personal favorite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer, who is clearly reading her lines about something, but who still manages to ruin them. Enough said. The gay couple could not be less convincing. There is the vaguely attractive and completely greedy boy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little mess of cartoons from bistic advertisements. Only more fat. And less talented. <br /> <br /> The "movie" was also filmed by someone who is unable to keep a video camera even remotely, and the number of errors is incredible. It all starts with the fat man in bed with a pair of boots. Yes. <br /> <br /> But in any case, we all know how terrible this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the "film" offers. <br /> <br /> - When the fat man burns the church down and then dances like a six-year-old girl through the parking lot to escape. Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! I have no idea what her relationship with the main characters is - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she appears in a couple of scenes anyway. Exhilarating. <br /> <br /> - The stoned lawyer. I've already mentioned it, but it's so funny that it deserves another mention. <br /> <br /> - Bad brothers dine with the crackers who relax for his guests. <br /> <br /> - The anti-brother of the evil gay potion. <br /> <br /> - The cats of the bad brother. <br /> <br /> - The finale, which I will not give away because it MUST be seen to be believed. I warn you though, make sure you don't eat at that moment !!!! The tank of the main character of the lard / director / producer remains naked. Do it. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you will see in a long time. Literally, there is nothing good in this excuse for a film, a director's goon even manages to turn the opening credits into a joke by writing his name about 15 times.
