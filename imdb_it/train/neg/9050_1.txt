I saw this film in its entirety in the 60s and 70s, yes it is macabre, and it could be the ancestor of the popular series "Faces of Death" in the 80s and 90s. Considering the state of so-called "driver education" these days, this should be required for all those preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all its gore and horror, of course (if you have some sensitivity) you get a truer perspective on the responsibilities needed to drive safely, which can be a single moment of carefree or distracting driving. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s, and at a certain point a security course was assigned. I found this film in the company library, I showed it during the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said "I never knew a car accident could be so terrible!" This film, and another, "ASFALTO ROSSO", is certainly the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I just wish I had found a copy when my kids were attending the "driver's ed" in high school!
