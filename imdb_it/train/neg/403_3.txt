Another violent and angry fantasy by Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is an enigma: it is difficult to say whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intentions or works in complete oblivion. He also seems completely oblivious to the fact that all the brilliant images of the world (and this has some exceptional ones) cannot hide a neglect of history, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered invisibility and uses it to force him into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a sympathetic actor who occasionally shows his dark side ("The River Wild") in an attempt to compensate for his boyish appearance; given the material, however, Bacon is not hateful enough to force him. The other protagonists are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom is gifted enough to make a good impression and who, when forced to give an insane dialogue, gets embarrassed. The culminating point is a study on preponderance and disbelief must be truly suspended.
