Mr. VanHook took a good idea and kicked it like a soccer ball. Unfortunately, it didn't do the goal. The historical subject of the giants is good, but pour goon milk and finish with a giant cheese wheel. I say, take this reel wheel and roll it from a cliff. I couldn't even watch the whole movie. This says a lot because I rarely walk away from any movie. I always like to give them a chance for last-minute redemption. It is impossible to redeem something so ugly. Well, at least the acting was good ... NOT! <br /> <br /> The only thing that "falls" in this film is the evaluation. 1/10 and sinking into negative numbers!
