I'm Puerto Rican and this is one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen of any kind. You can see that the people on it are clueless. They don't know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They say they are Puerto Ricans because they come from Puerto Rican descendants, but they probably know less than others who do not come from there. You can see while they are talking that they contradict themselves. If you'd like to see a real, and I mean a real authentic documentary from Puerto Rico, then you have to see "Mi Puerto Rico". It is a serious and real documentary. Not like this piece of junk. Rosie Perez based this documentary on herself. I thought it was for the Puerto Ricans. They keep repeating that I didn't know. Well, that's the only thing they got on this so-called documentary. I hate to see such a piece of junk being made using the island name. Lower the standards.
