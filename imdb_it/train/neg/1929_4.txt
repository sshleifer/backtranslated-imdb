Some praised - Atlantis: - The Empire lost - like a Disney adult adventure. I don't think so - at least not to think about adults. <br /> <br /> This script suggests a beginning like a live action movie, which has hit someone like the kind of shit you can't sell to adults anymore. The "crack staff" of many old adventure films has been made much earlier, (think of The Dirty Dozen) but - Atlantis - represents one of the worst films in that motif. The characters are weak. Even the background that each member cuts out seems to be uncomfortable and uncomfortable at best. An MD / Medicine Man, a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted children, if we hadn't seen them before, we've already seen mix-and-match quirks. The story of how a companion, Vinny interpreted by Don Novello (P. Guido Sarducci), passed from florists to completely inconsistent demolitions. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, a young academic obsessed with Atlantis voiced by Michael J. Fox, has some depth for him. Milo's quest for Atlantis continues that of his grandfather who raised him. The opening scene shows a much younger Milo climbing on one knee while his grandfather puts his helmet on his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were thin at best, the best part of -Atlantis- was the talent of the voice. Commander Rourke does not lose the voice of James Garner. Although Rourke is a handsome military serial man, Garner shows his ability to bring characters to life simply with his delivery. Garner's vocal performance is the highest point. I am sorry to say that the dying King of Leonard Nimoy is nothing but obligatory. Moreover, Don Novello as a demolition expert, Vinny Santorini, was also noteworthy for one or two well-made and fun lines, but I always liked Father Guido Sarducci anyway. <br /> <br /> Computer animation was also well done. BACKGROUND animation, that is. The character's animation does nothing if it doesn't make even the already flat characters appear flat. Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is not much to impress. <br /> <br /> The plot was the worst. Some say banal or trivial. I'm not so sure. Any useful plot can be turned into something new with the proper treatment. Shakespeare often started from a known storyline and plot and was famous only for wearing a new coat of paint. So the treatment is the thing. And - Atlantis - obviously does not know. <br /> <br /> I can't start getting into all the logical gaps without a spoiler section. The plot was ugly. The bridges of the plot break like string and the ending makes no sense. To add to this, the script and animation are full of annoying sloppiness. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Right at the beginning, when Milo reveals that runic or Celtic symbols have been incorrectly transliterated and the "Coast of Ireland" should read the "Coast of Iceland", we begin to have problems. The writers of the script would need to know the English version of Eire or Eireann as "Ireland" and completely ignore the older term, the Latin term Hibernia. But more than that, they need to know the Viking conspiracy to call the greenest island in Iceland and the most expensive island in Greenland. <br /> <br /> Referring to a mis-worded "letter", the writers have condemned to request a runic version of English and a post-Roman date on the script. Because this is a long time after Atlantis should have sunk into its underwater cave. And without visible clues and less technology than Milo, it has made the registration much less reliable. <br /> <br /> The Shepherd's Journal could not have been written before the sinking of Atlantis, otherwise it would have known nothing of the cave or of the crystal lying "in the eye of the king". It must have been written after the sinking, but without even the technology that Milo's expedition had, how on earth did anyone take Leviathan. So how could you learn more about something later? And why should it be written in Atlantian? <br /> <br /> Automatic writing and clairvoyance or astral travel can explain these things. However clairvoyance and astral travel do not require writing in Atlantian. So it must be a kind of automatic writing. Since no one in Atlantis can read, they must be the spirits of crystal messages that radiate to the surface. This would have made more sense. But it could also have been explained in the film: Milo could have discovered that this power had called him for life - he appeared in dreams, etc. This had to be explored in the film. <br /> <br /> Atlantians should simply not be able to understand modern languages. No one expects the original Indo-Europeans to be able to converse in Europe, any more than the Romans understand that the "cs" or their day become "ch" French (pronounced as "sh" s, no less!) <br /> <br /> The current Atlantians were alive before the cataclysm - when they apparently * could * read, yet now they are unable to read what they used to do, or to operate with similar machinery. <br /> <br /> Mass illiteracy indicates a crucial flaw in the film. Nothing seems to have happened to this culture. He seems suspended in the air until Milo can save him. Although it seems that life is not a constant struggle for survival, no one wants to compose poems or write novels and perhaps it is a combination of Atlantian school systems that go downhill towards the end and lack of good fiction that caused Atlantis to fall into 'illiteracy. <br /> <br /> Kida can be justified for not knowing how to read or operate the machine if it was so young when the Cataclysm of Stupidity is set - but ANY IT ** HARDLY ** qualifies his father for deification !! The madness of Kashakim almost alone swept away his people from existence. He killed a group in the cataclysm, slowed progress (not much killed here, but oversaw a huge slip in culture and progress) until someone could take the crystal to kill everyone if they hadn't been boiled before because the Giant Robots weren't there to protect them. <br /> <br /> A bolt of blue electricity should have destroyed the likeness of Kashakim, when Kida tried to unite her father's image with the circle of GREAT Kings of Atlantis! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantian, Rourke and the others knew enough to look at a meaningless word book and find a page on a crystal - which he knew to be a crystal and not some stylized astrological or "phases of the sun diagram. <br /> <br /> If Milo's grandfather had told Rourke to him, he still doesn't explain how Rourke would have suffered from reading it from Milo as part of the book. - which was within reach of Rourke, although Milo did not find any sign of a page torn in the book apparently - he was there only to make the observer understand that "something was not quite right" unless the word "crystal" had not put alarms in Milo's head that someone would try to steal it, Milo would not have suspected anything. It's just a ghostly omen. <br /> <br /> The "double cross" of the crew was not a character change We learned that Vinny, Sweet, Audrey and Cookies had followed Rourke from the beginning. However, the "change of heart" falls flat. It was a change and had to be better motivated. Difficult to do with characters who have not been given anything to begin with. <br /> <br /> Niggling a little that the lava flows over the dome, instead of filling the rest of the area we see the sequence from. It's liquid; it does not flow over the protective dome until it fills all the lower areas. <br /> <br /> The STINKS finale! - and it makes no sense except to appease political correctness. With its source of power restored, Atlantis is no longer a weak power that needs pampering. The giant robot guardians and celestial cycles that shoot blue lightning suggest that they have less to fear than we could. The technology is superior to ours and certainly at the beginning of the 20th century. In the end Milo needs to teach the Atlantians to read, for what? The idea is to leave their small, tranquil and chastened culture alone, not to send it to the hypermarket. <br /> <br /> ** FINE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the plot of Lost World and the setting of the end of the century should suggest that this is more a tribute to meatloaf. The failures I find with the film agree with this idea. But I can't understand why I should pay to see skinny characters and holes in the plot simply because they too have had many ten-cent novels. And the stories of the pulp are part of the "shit of not being able to sell adults" anyway. We have become a little more sophisticated and our pulp needs to grow too. The Raiders of the Lost Ark have not lost their pulp sensation and have avoided so much malice. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 - the movie is fun but, as I think about the plot, it's getting lower.
