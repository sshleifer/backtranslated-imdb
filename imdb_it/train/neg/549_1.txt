I can't believe that the Indian film industry is still distributing third-level waste like Waqt. For beginners, the plot is totally implausible ?? the spoiled son is thrown out of the family home to teach him self-sufficiency. So what does it do? Soon he promptly wins some national talent competition by jumping stars in front of a jury (honestly I'm not kidding here). Meanwhile, his father is dying of lung cancer, but he keeps his son's secret, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, see his new nephew and even make a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> Is acting worthy of intimacy ?? no effort has been made to try to act convincingly by any of the main actors in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge villa and seemed relatively untouched by real world concerns. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the biggest losers when making such terrible movies are the smart viewers who made the mistake of seeing a movie like that. Actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as gods by those people who have nothing but a blind faith in Bollywood.
