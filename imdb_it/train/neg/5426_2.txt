But it is sad to see once that Yvonne DeCarlo has been reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the part of Charlotte Rae. <br /> <br /> The eighties were the golden age for horror and incredibly stupid horror films like this, and `Mirror, Mirror 'was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.
