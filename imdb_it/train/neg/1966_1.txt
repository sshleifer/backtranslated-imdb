I was tricked into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and the man was p.o'd !!! it took me at least 15 minutes to get it from the shelf b / c I didn't want anyone to see me. then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I thought that all my stress would pay off when I returned home and watching the b / c movie the review I read said that the film was a pleasant surprise; what a joke! if you can get through the first hour of the movie, then you're in luck! b / c it was not until then that the film's turn became a horror. don't worry about these people, you'll be better off watching "the falls of the void"
