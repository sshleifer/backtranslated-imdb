"Diary of Sex Addict" is a pathetic attempt to dramatize sexual compulsiveness. Probably a film marketing scam, this film is an elegant shot with a good cast and little else. In short, "Diary ..." would have us believe that our sexist-dependent character has the stupidest wife in the world, a stable of girls on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim , and no work despite being a restaurateur. At best, this film could have been a good drama. In the worst case, economic softcore. "Diary ..." is neither anywhere. This is for the dumpster. (D)
