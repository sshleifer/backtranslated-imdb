the only fun thing about this highly radiant film is playing "guess" that position. What is Toronto's point of reference for what is the American / international place. <br /> <br /> Who knew the anti-christ would be Russian? obviously it can't be American since we need the yans to save the day - oh Buck ... you'll tell us the whole truth ... you'll show us the light ... and the way to the building should those bad anti-baptists they make their way. <br /> <br /> Five golden raspberries. Faith is not enough to hope that they will not do another of this kind! We must not pray.
