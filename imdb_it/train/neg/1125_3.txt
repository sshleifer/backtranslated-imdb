I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that's how I heard about this movie, I really don't know if it was at the theater. I can not remember the name. I saw it, it's like one of the special ones after school. The acting is OK, not great. The plot was rather weak and the lines were rather mushy. So the only comment I can give to this movie is "Eh" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy, if I were in a movie rental place, this is one I would like to pass and after looking at it I would not recommend it to anyone middle school age. I also noticed that many times when urban children are portrayed, the slang is abused or just passed. Many times I think that's what makes their characters incredible.
