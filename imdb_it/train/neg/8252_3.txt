Whattt was with the sound? It seemed to be all nicknamed. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bad. Tracing = bad. Accents = bad (also Dougray, and we live in Scotland), Acting = bad, Harp = bad, Sex scenes - bad / cringive. <br /> <br /> Again, we looked incredulous to the end. How could such a good appeal by actors behave so badly? Will they ever have a decent job again? <br /> <br /> Bad, Bad, Bad. By the way, we gave the 3 because at least we were enticed to watch it until the end because of its bizarre plot, etc. <br /> <br /> And for the older reviewer - I totally agree, it was like a romantic farce of the 1940s. How was it done in 2004? <br /> <br /> OK, OK, there were some OK bits. They had a nice house in Bristol. Dougray had a nice boat. Jennifer looked pretty in a small dress. But why did the sister take all the men?
