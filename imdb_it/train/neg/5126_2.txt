I rented this movie because I hoped the whole family would like it. Even if the film is suitable for families, my family did not appreciate it because it gives a false vision of God. If you obey and follow God, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You won't magically get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You will not always get an increase. Sometimes, you'll be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to satisfy our every whim. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we glorify it more when things seem to go wrong for us. Living is Christ; dying is a gain.
