"New Best Friend" is another voice in the sub-genre "steals another woman"; the best of which are "Single White Female" and "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"; the worst you can catch almost every afternoon on the Lifetime channel. For some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this kind of story. You can make the woman bad at first and let the audience consciously watch as she elaborates and implements her evil plan. Or use the wrong direction to make it look like a good person, since an apparently unplanned set of events breaks in its favor until it turns out to be evil in the climate scene. Unfortunately the creators of "New Best Friend" failed to decide how they wanted to play it and things got stuck and burned early. First we meet Alicia (Mia Kirshner) who scams the college's financial aid office for scholarship money. Now we know that he is a bad person and will see all his subsequent activities with suspicion. But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spent the next 50 minutes disapproving to make us think that Alicia was a good person. This introduces the only element of suspense, not the fact that she is bad, but about when the director and the editor testify and stop wasting our time with transparent disinformation. <br /> <br /> "New Best Friend" suffers more than most from the cinematic curse of a cast too old to represent college students. There are only two important parts, Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of production. It works almost for the 26-year-old Kirshner when she plays the mousy version of Alicia, but becomes dazzling when turned into the glamorous version of Alicia. The casting of Monroe is simply a joke, as if Nicholette Sheridan tried to pass as a classmate on "Lizzie McGwire". It seems much closer to a mid-life crisis than a term. <br /> <br /> Producers must have many favors because this age problem extends to most supporting characters. Taye Diggs who plays the sheriff of the city is younger than most of the students. <br /> <br /> The basic set-up is that of Hadley and two other party girls (played by Dominque Swain-21 and Rachel True-35) are college roommates. They share (as a student residence) a villa that is more beautiful and better furnished than the villa on Real World-New Orleans (a more credible premise than mothers playing soccer to students). Alicia moves into the villa and begins to take over Hadley's life. At least that way, Swain finally gets a roommate from his own generation, so the two can have a lesbian scene. Swain's supporting performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend" and his love scene with Kirshner is fantastic, so beautiful and artistic that it doesn't fit any of the other segments, maybe it was subcontracted to a good director and director of photography. <br /> <br /> The unintentionally exhilarating story is presented in a series of dark flashbacks of unbridled sex and uninterrupted parties, each of which is preceded by a shot of a comedian Alicia in a hospital bed. About half of Kirshner's screen is spent lying motionless with a tube in his mouth. My mother is not a good career. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
