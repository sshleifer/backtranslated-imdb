This film reminds me of many anti-drug films from the 1950s and 1960s due to the fact that it was created by people who obviously never experienced the social evil they warn us about. Tom Hanks and his friends are "role-playing games", but there are no dice, many candles, and then you are simply wiped out in a nasty montage showing Hanks falling for the woman in the group. quite funny but misguided. I wonder how many poor children destroyed their D & D stuff and they told us that the use of their imagination was the way to destruction. As a film, it's basically a special after-school, bad acting (though Hanks shows some of his talent) and couple talk, and no one seems to enjoy it. It seems that these films have a psychological focus on teenagers who start on the road to an adult, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to connect and do the things that everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2, it's worth watching for its unique genre, the scary movies, which I personally find rather amusing.
