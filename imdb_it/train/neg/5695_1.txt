This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi indicate that it is a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> However, the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a series of ridiculous twists that do little to hide the forced ending. The film moves between comedy (description used in an approximate way) and surreal drama with some adult scenes set in the context. The female lead (the title angel) is misinterpreted and the actress is not helped by the script that requires something incredible, extremes of character to portray. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part well, but is also disappointed by the poor script. One to avoid.
