I had no real expectations in this film and I'm happy. Even if I expected it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think 15% of the film consisted of footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field. I see. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. <br /> <br /> Secondly, a damn thing regarding scarecrows and paranormal events is never explained. Are there too many times I have been left to go to the WTF? <br /> <br /> Thirdly, the film takes itself seriously. I'm all for a B series movie with buckets of blood, screaming women and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or an ancient curse. But those films often know they are B-movies and even show it off, like Dead Snow (hilarious Atlanta zombie) or Evil Dead 2. But this film seems oblivious to its bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you're going to make a horror movie, do the murder. And if you're going to have a hot girl and a semi-hot girl, one of them must show at least some side tits. <br /> <br /> So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrow" and hit yourself in the eyes. You will thank me.
