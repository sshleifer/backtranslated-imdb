The plot, the character development and the gags in this movie are extremely weak. Enough lost time. Saving Grace's conclusion should make people feel warm and confused as if the characters had grown through their struggles. There has been no such development to make warm and confused feelings possible. Drug gags are clich√©s and most of the film doesn't sound true to life. The plot builds what should be the tension, but the characters are not developed enough to worry. Then he rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of time on the screen, leaving the viewer the feeling of having just wasted time.
