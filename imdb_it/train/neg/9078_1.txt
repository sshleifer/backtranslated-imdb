Wouldn't it be great if Not Another Teen Movie put an end to all these stupid, useless, I'm having more sex than you're a teen movie? In a perfect world, yes. Yet this is even worse. This is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating for the distributor. All the jokes are basically college students who expose things that people probably DON'T have an interest in seeing, yet it's "funny". Devon Sawa, who was really good at Final Destination, is simply boring in this movie. It makes you wonder if it's bad on purpose. Degree: F
