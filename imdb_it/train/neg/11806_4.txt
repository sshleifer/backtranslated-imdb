It was hard to watch this film and to be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan of the original 1944 film. This, for me and many others, is one of the greatest noir films ever made. Understanding that this is simply a film shortened for TV and that most people had ruined it, I didn't expect much, but you can't help but compare it to the '44 movie. Scene after scene, I found myself comparing what I was looking at and remembering how it happened with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I saw these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was all over, I discovered that it was not as bad as I expected but it is not compatible with the 1944 original. The two main areas where this made-for-TV movie was not good they were (1) the electricity between the two leads was missing and (2) being only 90 minutes, they hastened the story with little time to develop the plot, characters and chemistry between those tracks. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply had no correspondence with MacMurray and Stanwyck like "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson," respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this re-held was his, in the other characters, like "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton". Cobb was as exceptional as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, head of the insurance company. It was also a bit interesting to see the time change, so the houses, cars, phones, dictation machines, etc. They were all in the early 1970s instead of the mid-40s. Otherwise, the plot was very similar, it was rushed. <br /> <br /> However, one vision was enough and I will gladly return to the original version for the rest of my visions of this classic story and film.
