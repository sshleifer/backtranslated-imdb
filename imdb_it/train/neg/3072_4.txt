Margret Laurence probably did not intend to approve any of her novels for the film, let alone the stone angel. Hagar, as a character, was one who constantly challenged the social norm (Gainsay who dared, anyone?), And ended up almost sacrificing his humanity in the process. The symbols in the book (the stone angel, the silver thread, etc. etc.) are a constant reminder of this struggle of the old and the new and the carnage (so to speak) along the way. <br /> <br /> While the film is reasonably faithful to the plot of the book (but it's not really a storyline, isn't it?), I think it missed the point of capturing the spirit of the film. Agar's challenge (for the sake of the challenge) was not there. Bram could have been much more crude than he was portrayed, and Hagar's father could have been interpreted more "traditionally", so to speak. If the director had insisted on a stronger portrait, the film would be directed directly at home. <br /> <br /> Along the same lines, why should we see cell phones, organic products and other upgrades? We are trying to make some points for the sake of making some points (for example, the Muslim girl and the native people). Agar and co. I'm all but politically correct in the book, so why should we see it in the film version. Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but using it as an excuse to send politically correct subliminal messages that are totally irrelevant to the novel (and the film) seems like throwing punches under the intellect. <br /> <br /> There is also the public. We seem to have been conditioned to see loving people loving as cute and adorable. Why should he laugh every time Agar struggles with his whims? I doubt that Magaret Laurence wanted his readers to laugh or to Hagar. These people are frustrated and full of anguish, and all we do is laugh at them. I don't think Hagar and the others in his situation have justice.
