Don't listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are famous for putting the emphasis on sex and nudity for real fears in their horror films, but this one is just a little too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have an unbalanced sex scene with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Enjoy yourself the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very quickly monotonous. He doesn't even have a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film cannot even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being a legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was a classic rubbish after them) to a rather poor study of the woman who is repeatedly abused and tortured to a thriller of revenge. In the end, the director insists that this is based on a true story. Yes, that's fine. <br /> <br /> To be honest, there are some fun aspects of production. The female werewolf of the title is an observer and there are some beautiful blood effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Furthermore, the dubbed dialogue is rather amusing in a fashion field, in particular the most oscillating doctor in the world (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the film gets pretty annoying quickly. There is no real storyline or anything else. It's a shame, because when I read a description I felt that the film had real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is very long, slow and a bit too useless, even for the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)
