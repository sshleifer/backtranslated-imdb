If there was ever a worse comedy than "Gray Matters", I am not aware of it. The "funny" premise of New York's Jewish comedy is that the Sam & Gray brothers are mistaken for a couple and so they decide to settle Sam with a girl, only to discover that Gray is equally attracted to their goal - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently just a surprise for her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing 'drunk' from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests around the world for its Tom Cavanagh woodiness. Sissy Spacek shows a total inability to do comedy and will want this to be erased from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the friend of the house with absolute indifference. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and has not given anything to work with. The whole disaster is cemented by the bizarre performance of Graham that culminates with the penultimate scene in which he wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this film has ever been published, it has no saving features and should be avoided at all costs.
