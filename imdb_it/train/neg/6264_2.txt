Nightmare Weekend is proof that some people are so desperate to be "in the movies" that they are ready to do almost everything. <br /> <br /> I am not referring to the countless women who seem happy enough to appear completely In this horrible piece of garbage (after all, the naked female figure is a beautiful thing and nothing to be ashamed of). No ... I'm talking about those who are more than willing to cooperate with a badly made puppet named George. Now this is embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> A bio-electronic being created by the brilliant scientist Edward Brake (Wellington Meffert), George (who looks like a felt clown with green wool for his hair) is the clever artificially interface for a computer system advanced that manages a revolutionary device (a silver ball the size of a golf ball) which, if ingested, can reverse character disturbances. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality alteration experiments have been successful in the animal lab, but the cautious scientist is reluctant to conduct tests on human subjects, fearing that there may still be side effects. His evil assistant Julie (Debbie Laster), however, has no problems, and proceeds to use three beautiful young women as guinea pigs. Inevitably, they all turn into horrible killer mutants. <br /> <br /> With the special effects of the basements, a totally talented cast and an almost impossible plot to follow (I took notes while watching the film, and even then I am not entirely convinced that my synopsis is accurate), Nightmare Weekend is a complete and total disaster that not even some soft-core sex scenes and a pinch of blood can save. <br /> <br /> This movie also features one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in a horror movie: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Walkman wearing an idiot who gets into 80s music in a way that makes me look like Justin Timberlake in comparison.
