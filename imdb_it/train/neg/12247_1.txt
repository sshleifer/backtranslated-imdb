This movie is really terrible. terrible as it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. The special effects are so terrible. The acting was not convincing. <br /> <br /> It is a crocodile that attacks tourists as they watch a documentary on the "passage of blood". The navigation of the blood is when they sail around the sharks but it becomes terribly wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts the holidays. Sharks don't look real. The crocodile is even worse, and becomes even more pathetic when they escape from the creature, but the crocodile hangs and 2 females flash. The deaths are false and the pirates are just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> A useless and terrible film that is not worth seeing !!
