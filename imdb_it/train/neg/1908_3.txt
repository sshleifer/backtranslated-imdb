Yet another insult and slap in the face of gay men everywhere. This lame comedy attempt has nothing to recommend. Once again we have an attractive "straight" hero who presumably cannot convince any woman to take an interest in him. Yeah, for sure! And there is also presented the gay friend "nice and attractive", who is actually a fat old, bald and ugly, that the protagonist should find attractive. I also didn't find it attractive and I'm a fat and ugly old man (but luckily he's not bald)! Any actor talent there could be here was thrown away on a bad script, and a really terrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the cinema, but then he is no different from the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed.
