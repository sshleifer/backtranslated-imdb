Oh dear. This film could have been subtitled "When the writers strike!" What a stink. I had really high hopes for this, especially after reading the IMDb reviews, which makes me wonder at the whole IMDb classification system, but this is a separate issue. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc. So I was expecting great things. To say that I was disappointed is the euphemism of the year. There are so many things wrong with this film, but I will limit myself to (a) the implausibility of ANY family that behaves like these people (a mass aerobics workout? What planet is THAT real life?), The awkward script ( a killer of love? Please), and the fact that Dan's character is so unlikely, do you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This film was full of clumsy dialogues, creaking direction, ridiculous scripts and was slow, slow, slow. We would have left after half an hour if we hadn't been with my parents, who didn't go out much and don't like to waste money. Unlike the producers of this film, it would have been better to throw away all the money spent on turning this film into a bonfire, it would have been more fun. If you like movies, avoid this like the plague.
