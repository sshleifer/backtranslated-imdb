This film is horrendous. Decent or no combat scenes, acting is REALLY bad, as you can tell they are reading their lines from a card. With painful delivery of all cast members. Think of attending a high school opera and playing tricks on the obvious lack of fluidity in the actor's interactions (strange pauses between the different lines of the character, combined with the fast delivery of other people). If the film were all action, this could be forgivable, but much of the film includes the set-up of the plot and the style of Family Guy, irreverent cuts (Oh, wow, they're badly made). I presume they were trying to be funny with these, but again it came out as a group of high school students / university students trying to create a funny Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now to the fighting scenes. They are not so bad, considering the level of quality that is seen everywhere in the film. Nothing exceptional, certainly not at all near the same level as the other posters (Nothing like Drunken Master). The fights have an excessively scripted feeling, with MANY cuts at different angles with clearly different positions on the part of those involved. <br /> <br /> In summary, the only reason to watch this film is if you were one of the friends of the guy involved in this really very cheap production. Which boy could you ask for? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and looked at this masterpiece of middle school.
