This film was made for TV, so, taking this into account, I'm not going to write it as hard as I would for a feature film. The script is sub-par, but manages to be slightly humorous in patches, which means being or not. The acting is mostly exaggerated, but it is true for many low-cost films. <br /> <br /> The aspect of this movie that I really hated was that 90-95% of this is shot in a movie, but in random places, there will be 5-10 seconds when the movie is shot in video. You can tell because there is less contrast, the colors are less vivid, and the movie is clearly 30 frames per second instead of the 24 frames per second of the film. I'm not sure that maybe these scenes had to be shot later and at that time they didn't have the money to shoot on film (I assume this is the reason, anyway), but it's confusing and really makes the movie even worse, I've definitely seen movies worst, but I certainly wouldn't say that I liked this movie and I can't recommend anyone to see it.
