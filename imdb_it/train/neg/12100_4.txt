Now don't get me wrong. If you need an in-depth summary of everything that is wrong in the history of human civilization, as well as an impeccable path to a brighter future for humanity, who can you turn to better than a comedian and pop culture practitioner? If you need a good dose of all the solid, valid reasons why religion has survived utility, then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's sake (?)! This is a good point in itself. Maher rejects our religious past as a neurological disorder that conveniently ignores how all society, art and science are rooted in it. <br /> <br /> In this film, he relies on his keen skill together with irony and cynicism to express his point as he tried to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not up to it. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but clearly it's not the brightest bulb in the box. For example, he replies to an interviewee (and I use the term freely as clearly all the "ambushe") assertion that the existence of Jesus is an historical fact with an impassive "No, it is not" followed by a long look aimed at transmitting disdain for the naivety of the subject (a device nauseatingly abused in this film). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher was wrongly dead in his statement that Jesus is only mentioned in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels. I imagine that Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary while they make the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will roar loudly and sneer (they certainly did it at my performance). <br /> <br /> It is doubly saying, however, that the loudest and most mule roar occurred during about 70% of the execution time that the film dedicated to its anti-Christian tirade while the audience was completely silent during 10% dedicated to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Or the criticism of Islam is off-limits to the fashionable and liberal public or they were just afraid to laugh. Very eloquent, in both cases
