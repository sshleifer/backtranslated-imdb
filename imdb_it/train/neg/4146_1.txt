After seeing this thing, then reading the summary on the back of the DVD, then thinking back to the real movie ... I became a little dazed. I thought, maybe I fell asleep and dreamed of being a down baby syndrome dancing through an endless forest where people drive for 11 miles per hour and stop for a purpose other than the occasional bland lesbianism. Where (zombies?) They come out of nowhere and (vampires?) Who (seduces?) Citizens with a pure heart on their way to save the world. Neither zombies nor vampires meet greatly. The only battle I remember was to remove the panties of that walrus Bonny Giroux. Coo Coo ca FAT! All of them! Maybe because we were looking at it enlarged and we were too lazy to change it in its native resolution, but in reality it made it more fun ... In conclusion, my final thought thesis had more continuity, plot, character development, antagonism, subject matter, and thus acting on the totality of this film. He made Bloodrayne look like Citizen F *** ING KANE
