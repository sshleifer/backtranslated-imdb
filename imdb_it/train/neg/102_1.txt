My girlfriend once brought The Zombie Chronicles around for us to look at as a joke. We didn't realize that the joke was on her for paying Â£ 1 for this. While watching this movie I started to invent things I would rather do than watch The Zombie Chronicles. These include: <br /> <br /> 1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Recalling the American Civil War 5) Tax Return 6) GCSE Mathematics 7) Sex with an old lady. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The boy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best he did was knock down a door (the best part of the film). This was the worst movie I've ever seen, and I saw White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of shit. <br /> <br /> News just in: Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Done. <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK
