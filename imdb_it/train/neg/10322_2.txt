If you are trying to be offended or amused or both, you will probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP is actually not even very stimulating, in addition to stirring up the usual clich√©s. At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed by the fact that I actually sat in the forced chaos. <br /> <br /> Beyond the very subtle deceptive premise that drew all the initial attention to it in the first place is just another lame, harmless and anti-septic attempt at comment and entertainment that CBC typically excels in producing. And once "ZOMG MUSULMANI IN RURALE CANADA ROFLMAO !!" hype brings welcome, the show will probably follow the ether of deletion because it is so superficial when judged only for its merits. <br /> <br /> Unless you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject, I don't really see how LMOTP is fun other than satisfying the curiosity deriving from the hype . Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multi-ethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or introspection.
