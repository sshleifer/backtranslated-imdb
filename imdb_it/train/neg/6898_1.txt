Avoid this crap at all costs. Malicious script, bad direction, bad acting, bad editing, bad sound and bad music. Get the idea? This film tries to be Western in flavor, it is not. Try to be tough violent, it's not. Try to present a new look at an old genre, it's not like that. The actors try better, and my heart turns to them. But with such a stupid material to work with it's hard to make something shine. For me this has all the looks of a first attempt at "a new film school that will set the world on fire". Freshman filmmakers often bite more than they, or their budget, can chew. The best thing they can do is take a few steps back, reassess what is possible and work within their limited budget next time.
