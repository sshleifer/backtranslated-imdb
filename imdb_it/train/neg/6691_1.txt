MY EYES! IN THE NAME OF GOD AND EVERYTHING WHAT IS HOLY MAKE ME SHOW THIS FILM! what drugs you are dealing with! this could very well be the worst movie ever! I felt like I was on a bad acid trip all the time, I need to call a therapist to help me handle the trauma of this epic disaster. From beginning to end, the luminous strings are a true masterpiece of satanic cinema. when I thought about watching this movie with my best Jewish friend and her family we thought "oh hey, it could be fun! It will probably be bad, but still a little weird", as we were wrong, we were not prepared for how terrible this movie it could be. All my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the movie was finished, and during the course of the film, one of my friends tried to hang himself with a belt while another tried to cut his wrists with a spoonful of wood. I wish I had seen the video of The Ring, in that way the pain and suffering would have ended in just seven days. For all those who wish to see this film, YOU ARE NOT PREPARED! you might think you're a sort of "tough guy" renting it but this movie will break you, push you to the ground and urinate you.
