Elvis left the building and is lucky because he didn't have to watch this stinking dishonest. Scene-by-scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make a fun little screenplay even less fun. Filled with fun little dead, trite gay characterizations and jokes, this film is more desperate than funny. This is the kind of movie that gives hope that Kim Basinger will follow Doris Day into a premature retirement. Let us remember how she was (talented) and not how she became. David Leisure, the delightful Dennis Richards and the rest are all waste of talent here. Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn. The guy who plays Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King. The only real casting piece is the girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks' cameo. The cameo is not so funny, but at least it's not painful. One wonders if Zwick has indicted the images of Hanks or something that would have made him make this film.
