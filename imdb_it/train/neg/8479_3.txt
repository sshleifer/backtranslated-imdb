Ok, when I got to the board for this movie, I really expected people to make fun of it. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I liked the movie ... but only me and my little sister (which is, in fact, only 10) we made fun of everything. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan, but that acting was terrible. You know that a movie is directed to the bathroom when the protagonist can't act. And it doesn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very lousy ... pathetic border-lining. <br /> <br /> Even with that being said, I thought there were some good actors, like the gorgeous Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. Still, not enough to redeem the film. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie that I just can't get over: <br /> <br /> 1.) That Spencer guy would fall in love with her. Ok, eww. I looked for dates and, actually, he was only about four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much bigger. Jordan is a very pretty girl, but in GF she looked 10 or 12 years old ... she looked like a kid! Jake Abel (Spencer) looked like a university student. <br /> <br /> 2.) That there is a way that Kristi Yamaguchi would have come just to skate for a girl. I mean, I know that Katelin is good and everything, but it still seemed rather unlikely that Kristi would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships to skate, or that a school would employ a skating trainer with such connections. <br /> <br /> Having said that ... it wasn't the worst movie we've ever seen, but it wasn't even good for DCOM standards, which I consider quite low.
