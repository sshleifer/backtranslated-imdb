The protocol is an implausible film whose only thing it saves is that it plays Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of secondary actors. The story revolves around a cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes down the middle of the film and Goldie's charm doesn't save this film. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan, don't overdo this movie.
