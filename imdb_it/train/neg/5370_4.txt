Råzone is a terrible film! It's so simple. They seem to have tried to make a film to show the life of the reel. Just like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately Denmark lacks good young actors. Leon is still the child of "krummernes Jul" by many, and Laura is simply not good at playing such an important role. several times in the film he plays with the soul and this is destroying the film! <br /> <br /> Even if I consider it a movie you should see. I don't agree that young people behave this way, but I think it can show how it can end if you're letting your child go. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies as "Film Folket"! <br /> <br /> all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not because it's a great film, but because it's a film that deals with important issues. I also think it's important to point out that there are violent scenes, and in reality it is in these scenes that Laura performs better. - like the ending where he keeps the gun!
