Dragon Fighter is the first sci-fi movie (although I guess it's now called Syfy?) Original film I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two since then, and I can tell you they were stupid, but this really does scrape the bottom of the barrel. The CGI is bad, the acting is bad, the script is ridiculous and what happens in the end is unexpected and out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean, I didn't want to put a spoiler in my review). Furthermore, there was this musical melody that was used in practically every single dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they simply played it over and over again. And it's definitely not original; I know I've heard it somewhere before (I can't remember where). This is one to avoid.
