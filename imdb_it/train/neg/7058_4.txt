I came to NEW PORT SUD waiting for a surrogate film on the Columbine school massacre similar to Efantas by Gus Van Sant and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide stating that a sociopathic student rebels against the system gave me that impression but this is a film very boring where little happens, consider yourself warned <br /> <br /> The story is about Maddox, a student from a high school in Chicago who decides to react to what he perceives as an authoritarian regime. The main problem is that the character is subscribed and the actor who plays Blake Shields is not able to embellish any missing script. You have the feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler, Saddam or Bin Laden but he never runs into anything more than a truculent petulant teenager and it is impossible to believe he can muster any disciples. The subtext of overthrowing an authoritarian manipulative regime just to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious, which means that NEW PORT SUD is a completely unconvincing drama that is not worth going from your way of seeing
