I never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his character on screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, which I find VERY fun. (Charley Chase also reminds me of the brave Hen Broon of the Sunday Post comics page in Scotland.) In Chase's best films, I tend to admit his professionalism rather than mock him. I will credit Chase that his best films - such as "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - have inspired a fandom that is fiercely loyal to him ... but I'm sure that even Chase's biggest fan will be d agree that the very first and very crude 'Married to Order' is not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Chase - eager, awkward, gormless, naff - is a young knight hoping to woo the beautiful Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this film as his sloppy father, who disdains Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who did the most remarkable work as a film for Chaplin in Essanay, is present here as a rival. <br /> <br /> There is some action involving an Ingersoll watch. I was fascinated by the fact that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this a prime example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, one of the main flaws of "Married to Order" is the casting of Rosemary Theby in the role of Rose: she is destined to be a serial engineering, but Theby - with flat chest, with hawk's face - - is physically wrong for the role. Theby (Harry Myers' wife) has had a successful career as an on-screen actress, but has never been a credible person. The movie historian William K Everson took care of her very contemptuously in one of her film books. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate "Married to order" only 3 out of 10, and I am charitable ... because I continue to suspect that Charley Chase has something that others get, but I miss you.
