The head of a New York family, Jane Gail (in the role of Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (as Loma Barton) in "Smyrner's Candy Store". After Ms. Grandin has been abducted by traffickers in buying and selling women as prostitute slaves, Ms. Gail and her police boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must save the virtually threatened young woman. <br /> <br /> "Traffic in Souls" has a reputation that is difficult to sustain, is not very well done and shows nothing really unique in having the "virtue" of a young woman threatened by sex dealers . Perhaps, it can be supported as a film that treated the topic in a more than usual length (it was believed that they were originally ten reels, originally). The scenes set in New York City are the main attraction after all these years. The overview of the prisoners behind bars is memorable, because nothing else seems to be able to make the cameras move. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
