To begin with, I must stress the fact that you will feel completely lost for more than half an hour. Yes, some things happen, but you don't know why or why. When you finally understand things, you realize that it is nothing but a melancholy work, which deals with mature prostitutes, dead mothers, illegitimate children ... The characters are rather poor and the actors (especially the young) do not help much to seem credible. Only Marisa Paredes stands out, but she is a superb actress, no matter if the film is pure junk. <br /> <br /> The only positive things to say about "Fr√≠o Sol De Invierno" is that the novice Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions, and he shot a couple of scenes that are quite intense ... Well, maybe the next time ... <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
