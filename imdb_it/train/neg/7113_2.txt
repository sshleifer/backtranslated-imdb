THE SCREAMING SKULL (1 outta 5 stars) This film boasts some very nice opening titles (an off-screen narrator who warns that film clients will be offered a free funeral if they die of fear watching this movie, a scary shot of a skull emerges from a placid swimming pool and the omnipresent scary music) but, unfortunately, the film is all downhill from there. A widowed man brings his new bride to his secluded villa ... warning his servants and friends that the new lady has a very fragile disposition because of a tragedy in her past. Well, in less than no time, start seeing and listening to mysterious things that no one else can do. Her husband assures her that it's all in her mind and ... well, you can probably see where all this is going. You will understand what is happening long before our unfortunate heroine ... because you've probably seen the same story in hundreds of other movies and TV shows (and done even better). To add to the myriad of film transgressions, most of the cuts in this film (on numerous low-cost DVD collections) seem to lack some key scenes. See the heroine walking slowly towards the window ... she goes to open it ... you know she will see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene is reduced to sobbing in her husband's arms. So what did you see ??? I guess we'll never know.
