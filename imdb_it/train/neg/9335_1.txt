The reason this is such a bad film is because it is so badly written, and this is entirely the fault of the engraver writer Robert James Waller, who also wrote Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trivial and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A couple in error, a blocked American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamed, are overwhelmed by a strong and self-directed criminal, and after some adventures (mostly terrifying) alternate with scenes that show the more side hot of the killer, he leaves his partner helpless for the killer, who, bad as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone else before. Nothing can help this film succeed, not even the scratched face of Scott Glenn as a murderer, not the seductive latinity of Jean Zacar√≠as as Luz, nor the courageous interpretation of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track down the killer. A serious waste of time.
