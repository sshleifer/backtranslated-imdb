JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is how the name implies a ghost story. The theme wants to be horror but gets closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who is brutally killed returns from the dead. This constitutes what this film attempts to pass on as a plot. There really is nothing more. The film includes a series of vaguely connected scenes involving a boy who had an affair with this woman before his death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening scenes, this film looks like a "straight to -DVD" effort. Unlike gems, like VACANCY 2, the film has no sense of orientation or creativity and certainly gives a bad name to "straight-to-DVD" movies! The management is poor as can be with a complete lack of suspense, fear or tension. Even the elements of the drama are irretrievably managed and represent something more boring than the worst soap opera you could have had the misfortune to endure. <br /> <br /> Acting across the board is absolutely abyssal without any actor being involved in succeeding in showing even the slightest potential for a successful acting career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes are incredibly long, with very long pauses between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this film a rating of 2 rather than 1 is because some of the bad recitatives combined with even worse dialogues have been made for some involuntary laughs. I underline the word "few" in that sentence. This is not as a whole one of the "so bad-is-good" films like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch those movies. If you want to see a real ghost horror movie, watch THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (Korean original version), THE GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> <br /> anyone who has had the good fortune to avoid seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY to keep up the good work! Just forget this movie exists. Don't spare a thought for this!
