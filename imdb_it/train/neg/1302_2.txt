This film is like any other Dutch film, so if you like movies like turks fruit and de kleine blonde dood. so you could be fine with this (even if those two have much better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts off strong enough, but even that beautiful scene ends up having nothing to do with the plot. There is a lot of nudity (but I and the others could not find that attractive girl), the dialogue is ridiculous (as we did a lot with the annoyance of other movie watchers), and some of the scenes are so completely random that this it is more of an involuntary comedy than anything else (like a random scene in which an owl tears someone's eye ... it has nothing to do with anything and is mentioned only once later in a sentence that says " you heard what happened ... I was there "). the only reason I gave a 2 is because some of the places they look beautiful ... that's it. And the reason I saw it is that we went for a preview (here in the Netherlands we have a strange system with regards to hidden previews, you pay less money for a normal movie and you don't know which movie is that you'll be watching. you know it's a new movie that is not yet in theaters). My advice is to stay away from this movie if you really want to see a good temmink or zwartboek watch.
