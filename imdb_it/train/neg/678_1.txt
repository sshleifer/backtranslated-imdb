All I can really say is that I'm glad I knitted socks while watching the movie, or I'd be very angry for wasting 2 hours of my life. The acting was terrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that had to be serious that made my husband and I laugh out loud. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
