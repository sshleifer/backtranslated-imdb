This film has received much bad press from people who do not understand what it should have been. It must be understood that this film was never meant to be taken seriously. It is a field, along the lines of "Army of Darkness". AoD was foolish, but funny and bad in a good way. "House of the Dead" fails to be "good bad". <br /> <br /> There are intrinsic qualities in good campy films, the most important of those that are a credible fantasy. You have to believe what's happening in a movie to see humor when a situation goes incredibly badly. Without borders, the film becomes absurd. HotD lacks credibility. <br /> <br /> Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same twists and the character reactions that many horror films inevitably begin to show. For example, too often horror films fall into the trap where the main characters find the love between blood and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm chased by zombies, I want to go out with a hot girl. Believe it? No? So you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking the faces in this movie. <br /> <br /> Beyond the obvious problems that plague this film like so many other horror films, Uwe Boll has chosen to add scenes from the video game of shot zombies, randomly every time a character shoots a zombie movie. Not only is there no clear motivation for this artistic choice, but it distracts from an already incredible storyline. Moreover, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and apparently no attempt by the director to guide the reactions of the actors to the events ... leaving the film without salvific qualities. To avoid...
