As usual, I'm taking a crazy ride to see the movies I haven't seen before for the Oscars. I couldn't wait to see this movie as it seemed to be my alley. I cannot for the life of me understand why this film had the buzz it has. There is no history !! A group of boys travels around Iraq. One day I'm here to spread a bomb. Tomorrow they are gearing up around the countryside, alone no less and they start to catch fire from sniper. I look forward to returning to Baghdad. There is no cohesive story. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet boy who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military that is practical and just wants to get back to safety. And then we have the reckless cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a weakness for the precocious Iraqi boy who tries to sell soldiers' DVDs. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow the rules will make the sweet boy suffer with his renegade ways? Because yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that that cowboy soldier has a soft spot to be killed and drive him crazy? Because yes! There is no history here. The script is youthful and predictable! The camera is shaken a lot to make it look "artistic". And for all those who think it's such a great war image, go and rent "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money in this boring movie!
