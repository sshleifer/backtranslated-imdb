Seriously what were they thinking? Over the years the Columbo series has tried some new things and moved away from the usual formula of success, but this film really twists it. This film is fundamentally very different from any other Columbo film, but the differences are not for the film's sake. <br /> <br /> The main thing that makes this movie different from any other Columbo film is the fact that there was no murder committed there. The whole premise of this film is totally different and places the character of Columbo in a completely different environment and situation. Even the total is totally different and more 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> Director Alan J. Levi has made some other Columbo films in the past, which has remained faithful to the usual formula. It also makes a strange choice that has been chosen to direct this film. <br /> <br /> Even the character of Columbo feels very different, perhaps for the reason that he is put in a completely different environment and situation, when he helps his nephew after his bride disappeared immediately after the marriage . The absence of good Columbo humor of relief and brand does not make this watch really beautiful or pleasant. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, the film doesn't start too badly, but the film starts to get more and more ridiculous with its story as it progresses. It is such a stupid tale-thriller written with a story that is becoming increasingly unlikely. It also makes the film more and more unwatchable. This is a small and interesting entry from Columbo that doesn't really know how to entertain its viewers in any way. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't help much that secondary actors are not the most talented around. Despite the fact that his character is put in a totally different situation and the film is shot in a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still saves this film a bit. Can you just imagine what this movie would have been like without him? It would have been an extremely bad and ridiculous economic film that I can tell you. <br /> <br /> A strange Columbo voice, which could be described as a failed experiment to deviate from the usual formula. <br /> <br /> 4/10
