The only reason I shot this film is because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I always felt how awful it was. The film did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's clothes. The worst parts were, well, almost everything else. My 12-year-old son and I just writhed and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept asking ourselves why Max didn't want Kazzam to fix his front tooth! But as terrifying as we could not stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a pit of tar, it was hypnotic. But it was worth it for the laughter and only to say that we actually saw "Kazzam".
