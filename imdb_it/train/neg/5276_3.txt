No, it's nothing in that fairy tale with the pumpkin trainer, the fairy godmother and the glass slippers, but if I had to work out, I would have to ruin everything for you, which I won't. But don't let curiosity get the better of you, because this movie is not fantastic. It is one of those films that start promisingly, before betraying the public with intimidating tactics and an inconsistent plot. And this is real horror. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (A Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is your obedient, obedient and beautiful daughter. Their relationship is like a hand in the glove, so close that you would consider them more like brothers rather than parents-children. But things start to go wrong (they don't always) when Hyun-soo's friends, to whom Yoon-hee operated, start to go crazy. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a warning to the public, and to those Korean women who do not flinch when they go under the knife, if you want to believe the news. The only really scary moments are those plastic surgery scenes, although I somehow thought that Kim Ki-duk's Time really had more blood when describing and describing what happens during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> It is a story of two halves, the punch is an attempt to upset the public with standard scare tactics, which, I admit, have taken me from time to time. However, the second half degenerated the film into a melodramatic, brainless jumbo, and was rather forced to force its ideas into the throat. Some things start to make no sense, and while the attempts are always presented to explain, you probably won't buy it, not that the horror movies are logical to begin with. <br /> <br /> The leads are all beautiful, and there is a distinct lack of male presence in addition to the negligible role of the policeman. But hey, I'm not complaining, even though the plot could have been greatly improved. I would recommend you to watch it, only if you are a fan of mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Pay attention to those off-face moments!
