The first "Home Alone" was one of the most entertaining films of the 90s. The second was just as fun with the same cast and the same jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious to know how they could have continued with the same story, given that Kevin would have turned 17 in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So what does the director decide to do? He takes an equally annoying child and makes him sick. Is the child 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone at home? What kind of burger team are these idiots? I really don't want to go into too much detail if you want to watch this movie sadly. But please, I would advise you to stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time. Go and fold a sheet of paper, do the chores, put the pencil on your nose or take a nap! So it's better to look at "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
