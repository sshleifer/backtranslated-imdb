This film has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It's a curious WW2 movie, and serves as a statement on racism. It is worth looking to understand the fact that films reflect the way we perceive problems when they are produced and not about the time period they portray. It means that this is a film from the 70s and not a movie from the 40s (World War II). However, there are some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to capture a dam. The story centers on the captain who learns that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be taken from a Civil War movie and not from a WWII movie that reflects the true meaning of the film. The Black Lt. gives German women an innocent kiss on the cheek, and the white Capt becomes upset. I liked the film from a point of view of curiosity since the stars and the genre were interesting to me.
