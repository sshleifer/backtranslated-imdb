This film never appeared in theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I should have listened to the critics and passed this. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent array of actors, the film was very disappointing. Now I understand why he went directly to the video. <br /> <br /> I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush it could have a certain value. Everyone has done a great job in the past. <br /> <br /> The film was slow and never pulled me inside. I couldn't develop much empathy for the characters and I had to fight the urge to go on fast just to get to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this film, even if you are thinking of renting it only for eye candy purposes. It won't satisfy that either.
