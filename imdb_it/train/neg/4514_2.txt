The problem with the book, "Memoirs of a Geisha" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American way of thinking. Reading the book is like watching a magnificent ballet with great music, set designs and costumes performed by poultry dressed in those costumes, so far from the Japanese ways of thinking were the characters. <br /> <br /> The film is not Japan or a real geisha. It is a story of misconceptions of some American men about Japan and geisha filtered through their ignorance and misunderstanding. So what is this film if it's not about Japan or geisha? Is it pure fantasy as so many people have said? Yes, but then why turn it into an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There have been so many missed opportunities. Imagine a culture in which there are no Puritan speeches, no connotation of sin over sex. Sex is natural and normal How is sex managed in this film? Right. As if it were dirty The closest thing to a sex scene in the movie is Sayuri who wrinkles her nose and makes a disgusted grin for five seconds, as if the man trying to mount her had dropped a handful of cockroaches on his horse. <br /> <br /> Does anyone really enjoy sex in this movie? No. One character is said to be promiscuous, but all we see is that he is pushing his lover away because he looks like he doesn't want to get caught doing something dirty. A typical American Puritanism has no place in a film about Japanese geisha. <br /> <br /> Did Sayuri enjoy her first charm from some old codger after her cherry was auctioned? No. She lies there like a cold slab of meat on a log. Of course he shouldn't enjoy it. And this is what I mean by this film. Why couldn't they have given her something to enjoy? Why must all sex be sinful and wrong? <br /> <br /> Behind Mameha, the president was Sayuri's secret patron, and as such he was behind his virginity rod. She could have rigged the auction and won herself. Nobu didn't even bid. So why did the President allow that old codger to conquer her and, stinking of old stink, putting his fingers all over his naked body? Would any woman ever really forgive a man for that? <br /> <br /> Let's try to make sense of this. Supporting Mameha, the president has contracted debts for the training of Sayuri's geisha. To recover his debts, the president sold Sayuri to dr. Crab. Through Mameha, the president sold Sayuri's sexual favors to that old fool so the president could make money out of it. The president was not his patron. It was his pimp! A romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is gorgeous, but it's like the beauty of an attractive and seductive transvestite whose voice, appearance and touch are electrifying. But under that very feminine surface there is a threatening secret. Beneath the Japanese surface of the film that appears incorrectly, lies the threatening secret that the heart, soul, spirit and core of this film are entirely American and masculine. It's not the best thing to do if you're trying to be nothing but a lie, a distortion and terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> Some contrasts between Japan and the MOAG: <br /> <br /> Japanese style ?? Refined, elegant simplicity. Style MOAG ?? Beijing Opera. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Hair swept away. MOAG geisha ?? Loose hair that must surely have been piled up in the thick white makeup paste. <br /> <br /> Japanese crushed ice - The Japanese are rather strict on seasonal observances. Crushed ice is a real summer treat. Crushed ice MOAG - The president buys Chiyo, the young Sayuri played by the wonderful Suzuka Ohgo, this treatment during the cherry blossom viewing season. The thought made my whole body shiver with cold. <br /> <br /> Japanese Geisha ?? Trained and qualified entertainers. Geisha MOAG - sluts. <br /> <br /> Japanese wind chimes - Used in the summer because listening to the sound it produces, thanks to the breeze, the Japanese feel somehow cooler. MOAG wind chime - a bell! If a person were in front of another's house and had noises with a windmill, he would be considered crazy, he would not have entered. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Emphasis on human relationships, group-oriented. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is mine", American individualism. <br /> <br /> Traditional Japanese dance ?? Refined elegance. An almost geometric and mechanical precision. MOAG dance ?? Martha Graham goes mad for LSD while wearing a not very promising white funeral shroud. Performed by a geisha down a ramp in a place that looks like a strip club? Hahaha! Is it a strip club where they did most of their geisha research? <br /> <br /> Japan house fire ?? Setting or even starting a fire is worse than murder because it poses a terrible threat to the community. Fires can destroy wooden villages, cities and towns that destroy hundreds or thousands of homes and kill as many people. MOAG house fire - Great addition to a fighting scene but there are no consequences and because it is no longer necessary the fire out of control miraculously expands. Technically the film ended up here because, at least, Sayuri would have been ostracized and joined his sister among those who had never heard from him again. It is here that both Arthur Arthur and Rob Marshall should be exiled. <br /> <br /> Enough. The film sucks.
