This Tim Burton remake of the original "Planet of the Apes" of 1968 (and starring Charleton Heston) is a distant, distant cry from the quality and texture of the original. <br /> <br /> Surely the special effects have improved since 1968, but the writing has not. The characters were boring and the dialogue was horrible. I sat across the whole film with a friend (which I luckily only rented) and I completely understood why, before Christmas, all of the "Planet of the Apes" toys from Target were in the trash. <br /> <br /> My advice to Tim Burton: don't put it on your resume. <br /> <br /> My advice to everyone else: watch the original 1968 film "Planet of the Apes".
