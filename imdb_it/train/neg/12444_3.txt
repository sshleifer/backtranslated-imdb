Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes. <br /> <br /> I like the 50 sci fi, I also like the skis of the 50s, but this film is really, really bad. And not in an MST3K way. <br /> <br /> Practically unwatchable as a pair of bozos they make their best impression "hip cat" by Abott & Costello. <br /> <br /> Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi, as in "Cat Women On The Moon" but cannot in this case. This film requires a mute button and a fast forward feature. <br /> <br /> That said, I could see Gloria and Dolores walking around the spaceship for about an hour or so.
