This movie was awesome !! (Not quite as good as Leif Garrett's masterpiece, Longshot) but still fantastic !! I thought Ashley looked scary compared to Mary-Kate in this movie. I wonder why. Who would have thought to be able to shoot such places and almost get away with it. Dad was still an idiot and Mom was a little too friendly with Helmit Head. I give it 4. To all those who love this movie, take a look at Longshot.
