For all the hype about this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would eventually think. And, although a little slow at times, the first 90% of the film is pretty good, with more than a few "old" scares that make it a little nervous and unstable. I actually thought that photography was excellent for many of these scenes. Where Dark Remains fails, however, it is at its peak. The end of the film and the epilogue are those that seem to be MILES APART from his body. The plot falls completely on his face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer I was looking for the most - what REALLY happened to Emma? - has not been clarified on! The logic for negative energy was ridiculous at most, and in the end, I felt very cheated. What could have been a superb horror film was finally haunted by a terrible ending.
