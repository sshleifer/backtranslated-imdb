I was expecting a comedy like the "Big Mama" movies. Instead, the film was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This film has three plots: the first concerns Madea and her adopted daughter. The second concerns a woman who is engaged to a rich man who abuses her. The third concerns a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father. <br /> <br /> There is very little comedy in the film. There are also a series of very twisted messages in the film. For example, Madea beats the adopted child with a belt (in a comical way), to convince the child to straighten up. The child, in fact, turns around. Apparently, it pays to beat the children. <br /> <br /> There are plots dealing with rape of minors (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with old people watching young girls who are related to them. (The rim takes place during a family reunion.) The film jumps from one plot to another so that it is always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? In reality, nothing ... except a waste of time and money.
