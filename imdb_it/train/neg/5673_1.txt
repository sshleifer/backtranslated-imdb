I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made !!! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I'm not at all a hater of Uwe Boll like most people without humor on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll's films like Tunnel and Tunnel Rats are hilarious and therefore fun. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would have given a zero star rating if I could. The story is just shit! He spends four fifths of the film to build the plot and then they have the medium which is just scenes of horrible horrible murders done without taste! In the end he ends up with a "villan wins final" which is totally acceptable but certainly could have been more tasteful than that! <br /> <br /> I am not against Uwe Boll (as I said before) nor against violent films! I f ** re love violent movies! I loved Saw movies, Hostel movies, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, 28 films, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah, even Cannibal f ** king Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> He was simply cruel, sadistic and perverted! And watch the movies I've just listed! If I liked the cannibal holocaust and not this, then it must be bad! Uwe, don't get dark again! You're funny when you have a light heart, just like Ed Wood. This was just a horrible experience! I felt horrible everywhere after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT LOOK !!!! AVOID ALL THE COST !!!!!
