At first glance this gives the impression that it will be a resplendent blaxploitation blick, and contains moments in which it turns in that direction. However, the basic idea of ​​the story is much stronger than one might expect and is a respectable effort in portraying racial issues in the WWII army. The recognizable cast is inconstant, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the under-used Billy Dee Williams who is in excellent shape. Stephen Boyd, however, stops shortly before turning his bushy mustache in an eccentric round of stars. <br /> <br /> The obviously low budget leads to inconsistencies in production values. The locations are fantastic, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if "Saving Private Ryan" consisted in getting half of the platoon killed in exactly the same way that he had taken Vin Diesel's Caparzo (except we see the blow because the effects can't make it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns are went around in a jeep and shot five Germans for the climax. However, the epilogue, with the heroic soldiers who receive no respect for their success because they are black, and Boyd's racist Captain being run by this, is irresistible, as are the sequences of Turman's character writing in a Diary of his exploits imagined soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. <br /> <br /> In short, "The Black Brigade / Carter's Army" was unsuccessful. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be redone as a very beautiful film and, as it is, it is an interesting effort.
