Maybe I'm not sophisticated. This and Closer are two of the most supposedly cerebral films I've seen recently, and both suffer exactly the same problem in a harrowing way. The dialogue is false false false. Nothing that comes out of someone's mouth seems remotely credible. Perhaps the way this film is set is how it should be, but it was unwatchable. That's boring. I left after 20 minutes of boredom. <br /> <br /> I will stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I ever meet this on the teevee, I'll turn around and try to find an episode of Quincy.
