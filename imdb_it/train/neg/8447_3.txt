I don't know what I missed here, but I can't believe all these positive comments from so many people on this film. I thought it was silly, and a little exaggerated. I liked the performances of Gregg Henry and Michael Rooker, but the others were just ... boring. <br /> <br /> Now I like movies B, I really do, but this was a little lower in the alphabet for me. I saw someone compare the humor and horror of "Army Of Darkness" and "Shaun of the Dead", as well as "On par the The Re-Animator". Are you kidding. I did not find this film funny, he tried, he made an effort, (perhaps too much of an effort), but in my opinion he failed. The moment I was hit with the 3rd or 4th line, I was rolling my eyes and checking my watch. <br /> <br /> There were certainly tributes to many other films, which is always nice, a bit like a joke to us horror fans. But here it may have been just a lack of original thought. Sure, there have been some special effects, a good dose of blood, but this can't bring an entire film. The mutated Grant looked like a cross between Jabba the Hut and, in the early stages of the mutation, Chet from "Weird Science" (after being transformed into the monster) and an alien creature / children from "The Explorers". It just didn't work. I thought it looked like something that some Grade 5 art class kids could design. Then there was Brenda, the woman Grant had impregnated and chained in the barn. When help finally arrived, it looked like a huge tick waiting to be popped. The design once again was totally unimaginative. A round flesh-colored balloon with a face in the middle. * yawn * <br /> <br /> Now on the zombies - The more movies I see with the zombies these days the more I hope that George A. Romero has a patent on them and was the only writer / director to be able to do movies about them. He is the only person so far to do it well, with the exception of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (but that was a comedy). Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different style from Zombie. Perhaps Mr. Romero ruined every zombie movie because of his ingenious ability to make his actors moan, moan and go back and forth as if their joints were drained and even a drop of synovial fluid was missing, and their muscles are fighting the effects caused by the rigor mortis that had begun to stabilize before they were revived. The people of "Wheelsy" didn't have the right motivation ... they were horrible zombies. <br /> <br /> So in the end I give "Slither" a 3, for a couple of laughs and a few nice blood scenes.
