never watch this movie ... it's the biggest pile of sh * you I've ever seen in my life. and that is saying something. the acting, the plot and the shooting were absolutely terrible, this is THE WORST FILM IN THE WORLD !!! seriously does not even give you a shot since it costs my 99p from sainsburys and was done only in 2005? hahaha this movie is like a cheap university movie you can even see the camera in the corner of the screen .... even if you really want to see it you have to look at the "scary shark" scene ... maybe the best piece of acting I have seen in my life ... ha ha. I mean seriously this is the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours EVER !!
