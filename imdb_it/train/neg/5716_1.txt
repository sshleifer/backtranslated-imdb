This film is not deserved in the next few minutes that I will spend criticizing it, but I know that many people, like me, rely on IMDb.com to help decide on films. For this reason alone, I am writing this. <br /> <br /> "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... of course, it's all here along with a third grade script, pathetic acting and perverse failure of a black comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in China, yet everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the film who are horrified by the massacre of dogs in a market, yet they are sexually aroused at the idea of ​​entering a porn salon. A girl who is disgusted by the dirt in a toilet a few moments later is still there with her boyfriend (the way he came in could be the only engaging thing in this movie.) The film is absolutely horrible, even for a B- movie. Even if you had to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
