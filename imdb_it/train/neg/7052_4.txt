God this movie was so boring regardless of the music that I really loved, that is what sense it would really make this movie, please anyone who reads this review doesn't watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can act but he was really pathetic In this film, I'm really ashamed to be one of his fans, especially in this movie, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another pretty face without any lack of talent, how come, can't act at all, and there was no reason to be in this movie, because for the other girl Radha was ok i think, but could have done better. <br /> <br /> what a waste of time. please buy great music and don't watch this movie.
