this by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I gave up watching him after an hour and I regretted a lot of that time. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my hypothesis is that someone invented a strange animal form and started making a story out of it. borrowing some ideas from films like Resident Evil and Aliens does not result in a movie like them. if this is a Korean movie, I'd rather not even worry about seeing a trailer for the Korean film ... <br /> <br /> By the way, this film is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means that the film it is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online games has rated this movie over 8, even if he has no idea what it is.
