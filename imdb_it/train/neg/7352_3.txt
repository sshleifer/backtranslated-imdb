It wasn't fun in 1972. It's not fun now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I'm not hitting the film because it's incredibly sexist - I quote I liked that bit, or rather I liked the reaction it generates in the annoying PC characters - I'm beating because it is badly written and played. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable character is Blakey, who the 25-year-old British will recognize immediately since he was a favorite for the Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
