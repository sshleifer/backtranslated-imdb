*** Contains spoiler *** <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it incredibly boring and rather superficial, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: since in the end we have to die, how should we face life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to address that question, like Sabina? How important is loyalty in a relationship? How much of professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much should we be involved in political life and social issues in our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not read Kundera's novel, but after being disappointed by the film, I certainly will: I want to know if the story was ruined by the film adaptation (which is my hypothesis) or if it was boring from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I disagree with most of the positive comments that have defined the film as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and an example follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them when they make their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are there just to fill in the gaps but they don't add anything to the plot and you wonder if they are really necessary. <br /> <br /> 3) I didn't do it as Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. It is not human, in a sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally attached to someone, I have not found the credible interpretation. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina can afford his lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. Furthermore, the three main characters all have a lot of success in their respective professions, the which seems strange to me. a) How can Tereza become such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are ridiculous. And I'm not even a native speaker. Furthermore, the letter that Sabina receives while she is in the United States is written in Czech, which I found to be very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I imagine that most of the film was shot outdoors, so it's not hard to give the film a feeling of the east European, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague it is not even difficult to make it beautiful. <br /> <br /> 7) I found the final sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far from the temptations of the "metropolis", far from the social struggles that their fellow citizens live, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing that they are happy, indeed. So? If they were unhappy dead, would the movie message have been different? I don't think so. I considered it a sort of economic trick to please the public. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the film that is unbearably light is the way the director portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you have nothing left. You don't feel empathetic, you don't relate to them, you are left there on your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated the "stop the music in the restaurant scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why did Sabina have such a strong reaction? Why did Franz agree with her? I really "I don't understand the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has a bad temper and a strong personality. That's all. What's so special and unique about it?" <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked very much (that's why I gave you two). <br /> <br /> The "Naked Women Photoshoot", where envy, jealousy and insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> The other scene is the one that represents the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians: the images of Tereza, made to let the world know what happening in Prague, they are used to identify the people taking part in the riots, I found it quite original and the sense of d Tereza's experience and guilt are well represented. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small chance that the film was intentionally "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" is going to please and "Tereza" will hate it. If this is the case (I doubt it strongly, though), then my comment should be drastically modified.
