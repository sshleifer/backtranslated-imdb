The cover of the DVD and the album is terribly fantastic, you'd think they made a film about black braided desserts that is still a fantastic idea, but the actors in this film are worse than Ben's performance in Pearl Harbor, porn has a better quality and better actors. I would buy the DVD, but luckily I rented it first, the plot and the script are also horrible, nothing seems to go together, so the film never really makes sense. Poor attempts to scare you off using flashback scenes are worse than those used in sitcom 80s shows and eventually they'll let you head bang against the wall of your house.
