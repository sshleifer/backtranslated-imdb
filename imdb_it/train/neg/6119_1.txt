The muscular ape-man in the African jungles is hunted by an opportunist expedition team; the attractive daughter of the team leader finds him first. A very buttery version of Tarzan's story has an OK production, but it is paralyzed by the worst direction alone of a film I've ever seen. John Derek is uninspired beyond the action-type slow-motion shots and peek-glimpses of his wife Bo Derek's naked body; has about the talent behind Ed Wood's camera. Looking for ironic sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, quick timing and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and abandonment of skill (they warn the winds), but after a promising opening everything goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who has always had marbles in his mouth all the time) plays the lead role, but plays John Derek's third violin with the ego and Bo Derek's sense of importance. * from ****
