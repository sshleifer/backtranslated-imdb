I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco ?! Well, unless you lived through the 70s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY someone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't fully understand it) . They are just a couple of things that seemed to make sense at the time, but they really baffle new generations. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (mostly the 40s), they were very popular and had enough influence that the studio saw them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was long before my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "fun". After all, Kyser and his bandmates are incredibly hateful and their humor is very, very broad (ie, unsophisticated and cheese). Frankly, I couldn't stand their antics and didn't appreciate that there were too many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast has been sidelined and fans of these actors will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film involves Kyser and the band that comes to a villa where a young woman and her extravagant aunt live. Once there, the bridge is faded and strange events begin. In the end, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a seance (of sorts). It's all played for laughter - and it's not a horror movie despite the cast. <br /> <br /> Overall, entertainment is passable to the full. As a fan of Lugosi and Karloff, I definitely felt compelled to watch Kyser and his iron heads.
