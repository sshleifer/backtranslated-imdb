The foywonder review of this cheap STV hits the nail on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don't, a group of scientists heads into the deep forests of the northwestern Pacific, fiddling with a pile of bones in an animal cemetery. The Big Foot family does not kindly accept this, and proceeds to pick up the team one by one, mostly off the field. The Big Foot itself has a decidedly ape-like face, but it's less scary than Harry from HARRY AND HENDERSONS. Most of the film has generic wooden actors who pretend to be scientists who wander in the woods and walk away. This is a film without a budget where very little happens, at least on the screen. We see the sexiest of women taking a shower while watching one of her male mates, but nothing comes from this.
