... this verse does not destroy the Bard. It's still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet's uncle from Holland is inexplicably nicknamed by a Spaniard (whether it's Ricardo Montalban or not being discussed), and Maximilian Schell commits the foul like never before. Most of the dialogues have gone unnoticed, and the fact that the MST3K version feels obliged to repeatedly stress that the speeches are long * duh * does not seem so incredibly funny. Mostly it's just bad acting, though.
