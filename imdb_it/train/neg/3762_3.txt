I got this Blockbuster movie on one of those shelves where you could get 5 movies for $ 20. I must say I got my money on this. I expected horrible dialogue, lousy monsters and flickering cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two out of three are not bad. <br /> <br /> Acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've seen so many low budget movies recently that I've lost the perspective. There are some aspects where acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's at least at High School Play level. <br /> <br /> The CG of the Sasquatch in this film is probably the second worst part. The first thing I thought of when I saw it (and noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man with a monkey would have been better. A clandestine stop-motion animation would have seemed better. <br /> <br /> So you might ask yourself why I call the CG the second worst part. This is because the worst part of the film is the sound effects. They are noisy, annoying and constant. I have been camping, I know what insects sound in the woods at night, and while they can be noisy, they are not as deafening as the cacophony of this film. Usually when the "background" sounds drowned in the dialogue of the film, it's a bad thing, but from what I understood of the dialogue of this film, I didn't miss much. <br /> <br /> The action was rare and boring. The tension was non-existent, like any sense of empathy with the characters. About the characters, they were all sharp and insipid. The only moderately engaging game was between ... actually, I can't think of anything. There was a line or two that made me crack a pale smile, but it was all right. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you would normally see in a film like this. However, he still had that quality of "original film" that is obtained with films made in exchange for a pocket and a prayer. <br /> <br /> If you like me and have fun with a cheap genre movie, and see this in the dollar basket, think about taking it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.
