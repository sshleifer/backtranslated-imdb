Fool is stupid, in this black comedy, absolutely not interesting, supposed. Essentially the one who starts as Chris Klein trying to keep a low profile, eventually turns into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", only without laughter. For black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which "Play Dead" is not. To make black comedy work, it can't be petty, which is "Play Dead". What "Play Dead" is, is a city full of jobs. However, Fred Dunst does a rather nice imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's "A Simple Plan" character, while Jake Busey does a pretty nice imitation, well, Jake Busey. - MERK
