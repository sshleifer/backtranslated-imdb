Not the best movie for actors. The director focused on the celebrity of the projected actor rather than giving a good entertainer. He can be the hero himself, his family and his sincere fans can enjoy it. But certainly not worth it for a neutral audience. The fight sequences are a total comedy. The dance sequences in the song sequences are pathetic. Music is average. This film was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the clamor created during the film, the film failed miserably. Don't even think about watching this move, even if you want to kill time. You can watch some cartoons. A good cinephile cannot digest this shit for 2 and a half hours.
