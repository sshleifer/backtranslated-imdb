I'm not sure why I like Dolph Lundgren. I guess seeing it on the screen makes me feel that anyone who works hard can succeed regardless of talent. This is a good feeling for all of us who have no talent. Some of the other reviews point out how stupid Detention is, but many neglect to indicate the positive aspects. <br /> <br /> Any movie in which at least one annoying teenager is killed cannot be bad at all. Why do so many films that have a cast of teenagers always need to include stereotypical teenagers? Aren't there other types of teenagers? Does every group of teenagers have an angry black guy? A nerd genius that nobody likes? A slutty girl who is very friendly and (in this movie) pregnant? A white anti-social child disturbed by a destroyed home that everyone agrees is talented (but what is the talent?). And a relaxed black guy who is in tune with the Universe and so cool that all the other neurotic children trust him. So add a couple of general spendable kids of any color. They don't say much but are shot at some point. <br /> <br /> Detention would have been better if the bad guys blew up the school. Preferably with writers inside. The dialogue is bad and the plot is worse. When the bad guys (and the girl) finally steal a van full of drugs, then they sit inside the van that makes it out. They drive the van to the school because they want to repaint the van in the school paint shop, but they can never repaint the van. By the way, it would have been easier to simply put all the drugs in another car or two cars or another van or truck and escape without repainting the police van. They also never move drugs or sell them or do something else with the highest score. <br /> <br /> For some reason, they decide that they have to kill the children and the teacher (Dolph Lundgren) even if when the bad guys take over the school nobody remembers them remotely because it's after school hours. The handful of people still in school has nothing to do with paint vehicles, so why chase them? <br /> <br /> However, the best part of this film is that the villains are all armed with numerous machine guns, and continue to find the boys (including a boy in a wheelchair) and continue to shoot hundreds of bullets to teenagers and usually missing. Towards the end of the film there is some bloodshed. Whenever someone is hit, there must be at least three hundred bullets fired. The stunts are pretty bad. <br /> <br /> I read one of the reviews that say this movie has a budget of $ 10 million and I'm amazed. When I saw the movie, I thought maybe Lundgren had done it as a kind of charity work for a film school where he is the teacher. How maybe this film was their year-end exam. It was a test to watch it, but I passed.
