The 1973 "Tall Tall" sequel continues the real-life drama surrounding Sheriff Buford Pusser of Tennessee, but this installment sounds like a lame TV movie. Bo Svenson takes the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but is too gentle for the part; it comes off like a country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film a star closely linked to its good intentions, but the script is a transparent and lazy mass of routine situations and production is economically advantageous. It followed in 1977 from "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 from the television movie "A Real American Hero".
