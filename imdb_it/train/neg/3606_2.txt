This film is the worst movie, but it's very high for me. It's like a slasher movie. It takes place in a university where there seems to be only a handful of students. Teachers are dumber than a lot of hammers. He is full of a good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes Dialogue is so trivial that it's hard to believe that you can predict quotes. The cuts have a little creativity and seem to revolve around people who stab their genitals. A lack of continuity in the soundtrack and characters that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Grab a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
