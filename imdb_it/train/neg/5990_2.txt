I haven't seen all this yet; it's running on cable right now, and I seem to keep coming in the middle of it. The main reason I'm interested is that I'm a Bill Paxton fan; he's a pretty good actor, and throughout his career he's always done a good job. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that, although I was never a fan of the old series, I liked the Thunderbirds for ships and work effect. Derek Meddings was probably the best in the business in the sixties and seventies, and his plans for the International Rescue craft are wonderful. The current team has done a great job in translating his work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. Children are asked to drive it, and while they do a good job, it is difficult to suspend disbelief, especially when you have the eight-year-old Brains son who flies in T2, a huge multi-ton transport with all the buoyancy of a Buick . Wherever you look, see a Ford logo. Product placement is really above, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can do it only with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the film on its very subtle merits, Thunderbirds is a fun and entertaining ride. Just don't look too closely at the mechanism that guides it. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I could finally see all this and it's worse than I thought. The acting is fairly uniformly poor, and while the effects are quite good, the plot on multiple visions has become healthier. The exaggerated placement of the product for Ford is annoying, and children as central characters scratch my remaining nerves. As with The Avengers, ignoring the source material is bearable. But not much Watch the original show and see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Follow a refresher course at the Director's Guild. You can do better than this, old friend. <br /> <br /> Another footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw it again. Last night. Su Telemundo. Dubbed in Spanish, with edible sound effects. And yes, I came around in the middle, with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I didn't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse, but it was. It was embarrassingly ugly. <br /> <br /> If this had been done directly, no child to rescue, no joke could have worked. As it is, it is just another beloved childhood joy that has been ruined.
