When I first saw this film at the cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think that the direction and the cinematography are excellent, as is the music. But it is really the script that over time has started to annoy me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's writing self-absolute and unfaithful to the original book; he has reduced Marianne to a secondary character, a second violin to her too old, too severe Elinor - in the film she is given some sort of "focusing moments", and they often seem to be there just to show off Thompson herself. <br /> <br /> Do I understand that you cut several characters from the book, but leave out the only scene in which Willoughby is written in the book? For someone who has written and loved the book long before the film, those are the things that are always difficult to digest. <br /> <br /> As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She was not given the best script in the world to work with, but she still pulls it with grace, without too many sentimentalisms. Alan Rickman is fantastic, maybe a little old, but plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs is absolutely fantastic as always.
