This film is so ugly, it's comic. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, the TV show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this same movie to scoff. I suggest looking at it (maybe on YouTube) instead of actually seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see the Hobgoblin if you are not ready to stop in the first scene. Actually, don't see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. His jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have fun parodying or watching a parody of it and then watch the movie. <br /> <br /> You may feel sick while watching, so save yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Whatever is more fun than watching the Hobgoblin.
