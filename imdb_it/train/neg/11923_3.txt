An illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing serious consequences to many. Well turned and played even if the plot is a bit forced, yet the slow rhythm really stimulates the conclusion. The feeling of getting lost in the big city is actually transmitted. The little person lost in big business is something we can all refer to, but I can't say I don't want to see this movie.
