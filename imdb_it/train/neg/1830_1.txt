this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. the next time it happens, I will continually slide my head against the wall. it would be more pleasant to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is swollen to try to overcome this film. <br /> <br /> I hope the black and the bather never work together such a bad project again. they're both good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so embarrassing. <br /> <br /> if they had to do it all over again, I'm pretty sure they decide not to do it. the people who faced the money must have lost a ton. not really because the special effects (both of them) were terrible.
