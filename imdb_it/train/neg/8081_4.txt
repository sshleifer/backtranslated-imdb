One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it starts to become a satire, is that it is somehow plausible. I would think that an anti-matter bomb would do much more damage than it was intended. But I will leave it to the physicists who may have seen the solar crisis. <br /> <br /> It is a crisis that the earth is facing because solar flares are becoming completely out of control. They are approaching the Earth, so much that it has become unusually warm, as if the whole Earth were Death Valley. The answer is an antimatter bomb that a spaceship will have to take in the sun and explode there. This will hijack the flares to tell the direction of saying that Mercury is not in direct alignment with the Earth. <br /> <br /> Who deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep his mind on the business at hand and not on the runaway son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> There is also a villain here, Peter Boyle, who is the CEO of a multinational company that in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for survivors. The idea that he might not survive does not enter his mind. He is doing his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> Solar Crisis looks like a bad mix of 2001, A Space Odyssey and A Journey Down the Sea. Boyle seems to take his cue from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, apparently the only one in the cast who realizes he's in a turkey and neglects himself accordingly. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is brave, true blue and boring. Except perhaps the desert rat Jack Palance who finds Nemec and takes care of him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the film was directed by that notorious Hollywood flop producer, Allen Smithee. The film gets four stars for the cast involved and was released in time for a Thanksgiving sculpture.
