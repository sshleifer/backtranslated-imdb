I can watch a good bloody movie from time to time. I've seen pretty sick things. However, this is one of the few films I found to be grotesque in a way that was simply repulsive and disgusting. I like gore movies when they're funny. I like that there is a lot of creativity behind them. The blood in this film is not creative. He is sick. He is repulsive. It's completely unpleasant. For this reason, this film is certainly not fun. The film is a horror film, but it lacks fear. So pretty much the only reason why you would watch this movie is for cold blood, but this is the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the whole film, and this is very significant. The acting is terrible, the plot doesn't make sense, and the music is really annoying and FASHION too electronic. Everything took me out of the movie. Practically the whole film is a great, long and depressing test. There is this guy who has a strange shuttle accident and wakes up in a hospital to find out his skin is dissolving and melting. I imagine that after he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the fusion process. There is some strange subplot involving an old couple pursued by a dog, a dismembered head floating in a stream and an ending involving a man who is electrocuted. There were times when I really tried to enjoy it, but the only scene in the entire movie that I thought was even funny was the scene where a nurse runs along a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, bad and unattractive horror movies, this is for you.
