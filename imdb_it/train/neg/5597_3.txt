I will say that at least the film makes sense, but it is bad. The acting is mostly not good (I think only Sky has shown some promise) and you feel uncomfortable watching it. All the scenes that should be significant are really superficial, like when Ng comes out of his parents. There are many sad details, like the kanji tattoo on Sky's shoulder, the magnets on the girls' fridge and the terrible set decor ... and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything else. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point "I'm gay, not trivial". And not aware of it. Even the comment is horrible, I turned it off after Ng talks about how strange it was to play a lesbian.
