There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically a show for a woman. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to offer pleasure to the eyes. Liam Neeson has been completely wasted on this film. Like Jones, he had no role. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who had a real part in this David Self shit script. OK, it was his first and he redeemed himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I don't know what the problem of director Jan de Bont was. did a great job with Speed ​​and Twister. he really fell into this place. Perhaps he was still recovering from the Speed ​​2: Cruise Control disaster. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise this would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
