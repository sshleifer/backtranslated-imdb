Ironic that the fable of Dr. Seuss that emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most exalted, commercialized and successful of the Christmas holiday blockbusters. The general essence of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the ruin of Grinch against Christmas stems from an early childhood accident and that the Whos themselves are involved in the materialism of the season except for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen) . This film is an ardent and ambitious attempt to capture the strangeness and feeling of the story of Seuss, but the end result is a film that staggers and never fails to give an emotional punch to the animated version of Chuck Jones. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his interpretation of the diabolical Grinch, but whether it is dialogue, rhythm, or extraneous plots piled on the initial plot, the transformation from miserly bitter to joyous benefactor does not come on convincingly. There are some wonderful images and the makeup is fantastic, but in addition to the technical triumphs there is an element or two here that is missing. <br /> <br /> Success? <br /> <br /> Soul? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute comic that Howard can't make into a three-hour movie. Howard, Carey and the crew are all very capable and talented, but what appears to be a winning combination is only weak and tiring in its final product. If you need to see the feature length version, rent it on video with the animated version of Jones and you can see how much bigger and glitzier is not always better. I give this movie three Who-Hash cans out of five.
