Michael Keaton has never been a good actor; in Tim Burton's films Batman always falls into the shadow of his great villains. Here, he plays a widowed husband who acquires radio frequencies that seem to be dead people trying to get in touch with the living ... <br /> <br /> Well, this should be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses every point where it's shocking you. Because there is too much stuff that ends up being unexplained, unknown and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when everything gets so badly filmed in the first place that the WHITE NOISE makes it ridiculous? Really bad acting and creepy, this movie is not to be seen. Michael Keaton tries to make a thriller comeback but ends up missing the goal more than ever.
