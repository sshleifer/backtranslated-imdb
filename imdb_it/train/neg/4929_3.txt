The spoilers in this review are offered as a public service, because the only way to enjoy this costume melodrama is to know that our protagonist, Lady Barbara Skelton, is raped and killed at the end. And not a moment too soon. I would have turned the screen by myself, but I was afraid of hitting James Mason. <br /> <br /> The original 1943 novel, titled "The Life and Death of the Evil Lady Skelton" (I guess people don't have the lament on the spoiler back then), was written by a woman, a marmot English that was either upset or cynical or both. His heroine is incredibly beautiful, and the author seems to think that if you have beauty, nothing else matters. But other things matter, like the fact that Lady Barbara's immediate and only answer when someone gets in her way is murder. He kills three men in five attempts. A serial femme fatale, she has a case of a dissociating personality disorder that should have landed her in Bedlam or Newgate. <br /> <br /> Lockwood interprets it as a narcissistic vampire, with so much makeup that I thought of her as an era of the restoration of Joan Rivers (or an era of restoration, Joan Rivers, ha!). Yet Lady B. is irresistible for all three of the main male characters - Michael Rennie, James Mason and Griffith Jones, who all do a good job, as does Patricia Roc. Of course, all three admirers soon realize what a psychotic bitch Barbara is, but the plot keeps them all in her orbit until one of them finally kills her - accidentally, in what should be either irony or just sweets . Given the dramatic scene of death with a boom that lifts the camera from the windows and into the sky, I assume we should not care about his death. But his is the first corpse that doesn't matter.
