The unexpected downbeat of Robert Altman, western from the book "McCabe" by Edmund Naughton, has been neglected at the time of its release, but in recent years it has collected a critical following. Apart from a completely convincing boom-town scenario, the characters here do not deserve much interest, and the image appears (intentionally) brackish and unattractive. Bearded Warren Beatty plays an end-of-century entrepreneur who establishes himself in a struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits begin to arrive, Beatty is naturally threatened by the cities that want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn and wintery atmosphere for the film that gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sad town is limited - most of the story is composed of cartoons - and the rhythm of Altman it's deliberately slow. A declaration is hardly made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much thought. It is a self-defeating image, yet, in an eccentric way by Altman, it proudly brings defeat. ** from ****
