I totally agree with another of the reviewers here who was happy "For The Birds" won the 2002 Oscar for "Best Animated Short", not this sick material, which is pretentious at best and attractive to anyone obviously that has no belief in heaven or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but so are many animated short films. And by the way, I love dark humor, but this has been unattractive from the beginning. <br /> <br /> As for the story here: a guy who turns and is surrounded by nothing but gray (the symbolism here) is told by a television (which appears a few hundred meters away) that turns found in heaven, hell or purgatory. Each time you put a gun to your head and shoot yourself after hearing the news. I imagine it would be fun in two of the three instances.
