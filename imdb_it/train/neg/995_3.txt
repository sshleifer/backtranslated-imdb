Rosario Dawson is the protagonist of a girl who is raped and then begins a decent darkness until he is given the opportunity to take revenge. Although it is clear why Dawson played the role, he has the chance to show his acting skills and to make a small independent film, decidedly non-Hollywood, it is also clear that, apart from the good looks, Dawson seems out place in the role. Forgive me, I simply couldn't find it. That is not a mistake, this is what I felt, I had no idea where it was. Yes, I know it's on the screen, but even though I spent most of the two hours looking at it, she didn't leave any impression on me, what ever. I blame the script for this since it was different from the ending, not much of what happened on the screen seemed to make sense. People seemed to be more postures than real and what happened didn't seem to fit. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, if not the end (which I would like to talk about but which cannot cause its deterioration), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing but an image, remained with me What can I say, this can click with you, it might not do it, for me it's time I can't come back. Only for Rosario Dawson fans, even if you need to be warned there are several reasons why this is NC17. (And Rosario - please, you are a better actress, choose better scripts)
