This is a strange film hacked together, you have the feeling that the bond company has to get into this movie, I'm not surprised that there are no credits on it, that they would like to be associated with this movie. The acting of all the actors involved is terribly crazy and the plot jumps everywhere, doesn't make much sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to come in because it looks like there was a lot of footage that hadn't been shot, and all the music was very inadequate library music (I think it's cheap). Very, very strange. I could really buy a DVD, if you could let me figure out what the hell was going on, and what happened to this movie.
