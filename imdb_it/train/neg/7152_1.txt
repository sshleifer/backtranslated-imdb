Based on a self-taught novel by a girlfriend and groupie by F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess like an energetic drunk or damned alcoholic; in contradiction with the delicate and soft spoken true of Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on the age of Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing at the end of his life, the highly honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was not too proud to recycle his flapper stories to support both his wife (in a psychiatric hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second-hand Chevrolet, his life was 180 degrees different from that depicted in this film. Virtually every 20th century-Fox film made during the leadership of Daryll F. Zanuck, as well as practically every film directed by Henry King was a work of excellence. The unfaithful infidel was the exception.
