If I had not been obliged to see him for work reasons, I would never have passed the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit to having quickly forwarded the parts. The 1963 film version was far superior in all respects. Yes, I read that this is more faithful to the original, but wise what it was for the writer to change the script in '63! It's too long, drag, the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and without fantasy. The "Kids" version in the '63 version was a lot of fun and a true classic of sarcastic parents' humor. In this version Kim is too old, Conrad is * absolutely horrible * to see (when someone tore his shirt off I did it with disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what is sexy). . This Conrad can't dance, he can't sing (he can't even be in tune) and he is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been that way, his career would have ended before it started. As for the other actors, I kept waiting for Alexander's wig to fall while dancing and Daly was totally over Momma's side. Watch Stapleton's performance in the film version to see the same role performed correctly by someone who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time.
