After seeing Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving it every second, I finally had the chance to see the sequel of Life In Transformation. I was really disappointed because it didn't stand up to the high standards of the first one. 90 minutes of people with baskets in mind are not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's score for this had neither the beauty nor the related strength of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi this film seemed slow and useless. A watered-down version of Baraka, which is the same idea but made better. I really hope that the third film in this series does not follow the example of this waste.
