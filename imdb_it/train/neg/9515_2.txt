OK, I saw the original French version. But I can't imagine that this is better with subtitles. <br /> <br /> All I have to say is that it's the most boring movie I've seen in a long time. There are almost no saving qualities for this film. That's why I can't understand all the positive reviews. It could be realistic in a way, but some real stories are left unheard. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow-motion movies as long as they serve the purpose of the film. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow but allows introspection and sets the atmosphere of the film, for example. But in this case, the film is barely filed with a senseless dialogue that can tell us something about the characters. None of which I could identify or worry about. In many scenes I found myself thinking, "When are they going to shut up"? The acting was pretty bad. Not in an obvious and obvious way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters and they all seemed to want to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This could be due to the uninspired dialogue they were given. Even the entire flow of the film seemed quite mechanical. Moving from one scene to another. It seems that this film has just been written (badly) but never directed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few films that I can say has not generated any emotional response from any of the scenes. No suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no pain, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest as ever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-film.
