Van Damme. What else can I say? Bill Goldberg. WE GO THERE. NOW we know that this movie will be really horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this film on TBS, knowing it would be bad. But I didn't even think it would be so bad. The plot is terrible, Van Damme is aging (finally), but unlike Arnold, his films are too. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie. Don't see it. Never. I wouldn't even get paid to see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in his heart lies an exciting journey full of action. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketing experts would be sure we thought about it, right? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
