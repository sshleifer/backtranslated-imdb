In the film, I feel like it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This David Lynch short tells a story but not much of one. I felt it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It's a good film production, but in reality there is nothing else. As I said, I'm a big fan of David Lynch, but I get frustrated with some of his work because I don't really see the need. This is certainly the thing I liked the least so far, but I know he still has a lot of talent and I'm excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, look at this but don't be surprised when you don't like it much.
