Encouraged by the positive comments on this film, I couldn't wait to watch this movie. Bad mistake I have seen more than 950 films and this is really one of the worst of all - it's horrible in almost every way: editing, rhythm, plot, 'acting', soundtrack (the only song in the film - a lame country melody - is not played less than four times). The film seems cheap and unpleasant and is boring to the extreme. I have rarely been so happy to see the credits of a film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevents me from giving this 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from its best performance, at least it seems to be making a little effort. One only for Keitel's obsessives.
