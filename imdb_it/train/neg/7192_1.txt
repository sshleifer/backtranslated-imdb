5 minutes in this film I was hyperventilating, trembling and writhing in pain. And not in the right way. The story is about a troupe of idiot children who make phone jokes to a psychopath who is always a good idea. It turns out that psychopaths don't like prank calls because in 2 minutes he's at their door killing poor mom and dad Williams. Well jump 15 years and guess what? Still joking by calling people. One would think that a horrible murder would dissuade them from doing it again but no. So, after about two hours later and too many scams, I realized that this film gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a strong desire to take my life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing for the poor production, the "acting", or the Rutger lineage that is diminishing his career. I love horror horror movies but this is the most unsatisfactory piece I've ever seen. Do not do it.
