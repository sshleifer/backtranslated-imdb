I have read several positive reviews that have defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see, over and over again, is the annoyance of Megan, the idealistic political scientist, who tries to change the world. I loved his character. Maybe, because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'll change the world too, so I'm referring to Megan. Besides, it's pretty. She is not a super model, but more a pretty girl next door. <br /> <br /> OK, so he cried and screamed a lot. It is very dramatic and seems exaggerated, but does it not fit his character? She goes into that show with the intention of sacrificing her life to prove a point. Do you think the people who love this show are sick. I think he made his argument very well. Of course, being a young naive girl, she is terrified by what she is about to face. I think his acting accurately portrays a girl who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Furthermore, I think he maintained a certain dignity throughout the film, despite the desperate situation he was in. As for the film in general, besides Megan, it was more or less what I expected. He had excellent gore scenes, with micro-budget standards. The plot may have taken a quick idea, almost no contemplation. It is basically just an obscure humorist slasher film, which the name suggests. I love the doctor's sadism. He kept tearing up Megan's shirt, not only because of the cause of the squalor (though largely so), but also to torment her, before he killed her. The Chainsaw hick was hilarious. For slasher movie lovers, he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I gave this film 4 to 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot, and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would recommend it for an economic thrill, but hardly a rough diamond that is a micro-budget horror.
