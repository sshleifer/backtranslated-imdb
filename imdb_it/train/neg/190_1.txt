I always thought a good movie should have a plot. This particular film was missing one, and I think it would have been more effective with a plot. This was made even worse by the fact that it seemed to go on forever; I was anxious for it to end. However, I just noticed that it was only 123 minutes long; it seemed like four hours. Not only was there no plot, but the film also lacked considerable conflict. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I said it was until I saw "The Fast And The Furious". So, don't think that this review of mine comes from someone who needs nothing but action. Today I hate most action movies; it's just that this movie is completely on the other side of the spectrum. Not much in this film. However, the scenery and costumes were beautiful.
