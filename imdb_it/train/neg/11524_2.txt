A rather incoherent film about a man who belonged and left a superficial hippie religious cult of the 1960s, which fought them sixteen years later. The man has a son with one of the other cultists, who during a police raid is hidden and taken by another man named Falco who lives in a small cabin near the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in the city. It is difficult to keep track of who the characters are or what period of time the scenes should take place. The leader is released sixteen years later (I took it out of the box - I lost the amount of time in the film). No one is made to look older, not noticeably, however. <br /> <br /> A murder is done with a large circular saw, others are made with knives or a crossbow. I have never heard the name of the character of the title mentioned in the film, but he is the one who upsets the most, whistles and screams. <br /> <br /> The film is patched pretty badly, with the voiceover helping (not much) to explain what's going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is hit and we hear the sound of a whip breaking. A woman shoots a gun and we don't hear her shoot, but instead feel a bounce! It does not appear to have been made for comic effect.
