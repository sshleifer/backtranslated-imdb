This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life !! It was stupid there was no plot and the special effects were ridiculous !! And I've never seen him act so badly in my life! The only positive part of the film were the sexiest guys (especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie !! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because it gets to this point in the movie where the kids are all in bed touching each other. I mean, it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would recommend to anyone who has heard of this film and was interested in seeing it simply forget it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed !! The whole film was a total waste of time, in my opinion.
