I was lying on my bed, with a bad cold or flu or something. I imagine that maybe I would have spent some time watching some horror films that my mother had bought me a little while ago. I wish I had never chosen this movie! After seeing it, I felt even worse and wanted to vomit. Afterwords (when I improved naturally) I did some research on Dennis L. Rader and noticed that the Dennis in the movie was not similar to the real one. I hope no one ever watches this movie, but if they ever do they don't eat or you'll feel the way I felt after seeing it for the first time. I think you would have had a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better reviews on this site.
