I've been out of about 6 movies all my life. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how I sat for an hour. I must have been in a coma that night. I saw it in the theater when it was released 8 years ago. I couldn't even remember the name, but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller recited us. It must have really hit me to waste my time commenting on it today. Yech! He retched! Barf!
