Something very strange happens when you talk about global warming: science comes out of the window and "belief" and "consent" become the topic of discussion. <br /> <br /> It is because of this that I give a negative sign to Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting an intelligent discussion, he kept the debate at the level of "belief" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world by spending trillions of dollars to "stop global warming" you may think it's a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know how much of the current warming is caused by humans . Maybe none of this, maybe part of it, or maybe it passed the next ice age and we were really lucky not to have boiled the planet. <br /> <br /> But the fact remains that we don't. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "believe" in the "consent". It doesn't matter that any scientist who turns away from "consensus" is ostracized. It does not matter that the scientific investigation is losing the consent. Einstein did not "believe" in the consensus, neither Copernicus nor Galileo. <br /> <br /> So, why so much contempt attributed to those same researchers who advance in the field by asking difficult questions? If global warming is so incontrovertible, surely some people test that the theory cannot be so threatening. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? This is the film I was hoping Al Gore would have done. Istead, has chosen to support its support with the true "believers" of the "consensus". Sad, really.
