A warning not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is useless and non-addictive, and made me think often of a sentence by Twain about the desire that all the characters would be drowned together. When someone brings up the category of the worst movies ever created, I don't like the plans of _Plan 9_ or _Attack of the Killer Shrews_ I think of; it's the kind of this. What a complete waste of time - mine and everyone involved in this movie.
