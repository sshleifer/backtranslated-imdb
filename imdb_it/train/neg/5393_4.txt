I'm a Shakespeare fan and I can appreciate what Ken Branagh has done to bring Shakespeare back to a new generation of spectators. However, this film is not able to convey the general intentions of the game with the ridiculous musical sequences. Add that with the pace of Alicia Silverstone on the dialogue (reminiscent of Keanu Reeves in Much Ado About Nothing) and other poorly cast roles, all of this equates to a harrowing resistance to vision.
