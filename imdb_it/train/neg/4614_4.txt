It's amazing how this film was nominated for seven Oscars and won one. Not because it is abysmal or because given the collective credentials of the creative team behind it should really deserve them, but because in each category has been named the Honor of Prizzi disappoints. Some argue that the old Hollywood pioneer John Huston lost it at this point in his career, but I don't buy it. Only the previous year he signed the superb UNDER THE VULCANO, a study of obscure character set in Mexico, which ranks among the best I've ever done. The honor of Prizzi, on the other hand, a film full of star power, good intentions and a decent script, is a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The general tone and plot of a gangster who falls in love with a female hit-man foreshadows the extravagant transgressions that stormed Hollywood in the early 1990s but the script is too complicated for itself itself, the motivations are off and overall the story seems uncertain about what exactly it is trying to be: a romantic comedy, a criminal drama, a saga of gangsters etc. Jack Nicholson (making a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but sounds unconvincing from Jack) and Kathleen Turner in the main roles seem to be in paycheck mode, only passing through motions almost sleepwalking makes its way through parts. Anjelica Huston, on the other hand, behaves better, but her performance is sabotaged by the motivations of her character: the victim of contempt for her bigoted father begins, proves to be supportive to her ex-husband, then becomes a vengeful bitch who wants his head a plate. <br /> <br /> The colors of the film have a washed quality like they did in the early 1970s and Huston's direction is as uninteresting as everything else. There is a promise behind the story and maybe in the hands of a hungry director to be recognized that it could have been turned into something better but what's left seems like a movie that nobody was really interested in doing.
