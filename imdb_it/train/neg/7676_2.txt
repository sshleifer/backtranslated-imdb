I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so ugly, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, only some stereotypes that wander and are killed. The extent of character development was giving each character a name and an occupation, and that's all. There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes are just starting by themselves, coming from nowhere with a pounding techno track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking "Where is this happening? What's going on?" The acting was of dramatic quality from high school, with a rigid delivery in wood, as if the actors were reading the cues without understanding their lines. Their problem in providing the lines was made even more evident by the horrible sound design. ADR looked as if it had been recorded in an open room. The actors were constantly careful to hit their signs, with an almost robotic appearance in their movements. Thus, these listless automata follow one another through a series of implausible and confused scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. This was happening, now it's happening. Random scenes with few rhymes or motifs. I really enjoyed watching it. Definitely not worth nine dollars though.
