Crazy and prolonged manufacturing that attempts to document the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. He starts quite promising, with a probe still relevant in an airplane explosion, however the melodrama involving James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles intrudes (Miles used to play lukewarm wives under duress, and his frayed nerves arrive here program). The prestigious director Mervyn LeRoy directed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the photo fails to give a great impression. The best interpretation is interpreted by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, however most of the dialogues are ridiculous and the stubborn rhythm makes the film seem twice as long. * 1/2 from ****
