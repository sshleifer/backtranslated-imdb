I've never seen any of Spike Lee's previous films, because their trailers have never caught my interest. I saw and admired Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster's work and I have some of their DVDs. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. If this film is an indication of Spike Lee's ability as a director, my advice would be to "get a job", and stop wasting the time and talent of others. <br /> <br /> I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie I saw. I can only assume, from their light loving reviews, that their adoration of Spike Lee blinded them to the banality of this work. I only paid $ 2.50 in a "Second Run" theater, and I still felt that I had lost my money. <br /> <br /> IMDb's "Trivia" page says it all ....... <br /> <br /> * "Shot in 39 days" - How you can expect to shoot a big budget "Blockbuster "(as promised by the media advertising campaign), in such a short time? No wonder there was such a weak performance from everyone. <br /> <br /> * "Ron Howard was the first to direct the film ..." - He could have done justice to this project, given more time to do so obviously, of course. Although the writing was atrocious, the premise had some merits. <br /> <br /> OK! maybe not. I'm sorry! This film was so full of pitiful clich√©s, implausible scenes and disgusting characterizations, that perhaps he too could not have made much of it. (Hey Ron! Make sure to thank Russell ... Good call!) <br /> <br /> * "Jodie Foster filmed his part in three weeks." - And showed! Her portrait of a "Fixer", which makes people's problems go away, was as incredible as the script she was given. Did he also want to be there? <br /> <br /> Other Peeves: <br /> <br /> * How many bank thieves would have bothered to come to the door and inform a uniformed policeman that they were inside stealing the bank, and would do better to stay away ... or else? <br /> <br /> * When "Detective Frazier", (Denzel Washington), arrives at the bank to check that there are still no corpses, how many bank robbers, without a gun, would have "led" a policeman, (as much minus "leave" a policeman) back to the front door, allowing the police officer to walk behind him? <br /> <br /> * Det. Later Frazier claimed to have given the thief "every reason to shoot me". Why, then, in their brief struggle, didn't he even try to expose the face of the thief? This could have gotten the answer he was looking for ... a thief would only shoot him to prevent later identification. And why did it take "Steve, Stevie, Steve-O" (the thief's accomplice), so long to come and help out? <br /> <br /> * I understand that these were not the typical bank thieves. They had a different agenda and didn't want anyone hurting. But the cops had no reason to think they wouldn't. For them it was a hopeless situation. Why then, when two of the bad guys came out to "get the pizzas?", They weren't removed. (first of all, how many thieves would have come out without using a hostage as a shield? Is it Spike Lee's version of NY City, or SNL?). Breaking them down would reduce the numbers of the villain, ruin the plans and the other thieves would probably have given up. Otherwise, at least there would be less bad inside. (Give the SWAT something to do, or send them home!) <br /> <br /> * Which police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White, (Jodie Foster), to waltz right in the bank, and discuss an issue with thieves, who would not have revealed them before? He had no authority or governmental credentials; and besides, after all it was "already" a hostage situation ... add another? <br /> <br /> * Why would the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) not destroy incriminating documents long ago? Sentimentalism lives! Diamonds, he could sell. <br /> <br /> * Who was that "schmuck", (the character, not the actor), with Jersey's accent, who, conveniently, volunteered and said he knew the recording was "100% Albanian ", but nevertheless he himself could not speak it ..... SIR! PUT THE HAND DOWN! And his ex-wife! What a schlump it was !!! Both were absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> * During interrogation of suspects, because Det. Frazier, continually harassed individuals who obviously weren't part of the robbery, (ie - telling the old woman that he could go, and then she couldn't, then could he, then couldn't?) Give me a break! <br /> <br /> * Who, after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages jump, could not infer that their escape plan included leaving the bank pretending to be some of the hostages? <br /> <br /> * Towards the end of the film, it was shown that a false wall was built in the furnishings room, behind which Clive Owens hid for "a week" ... where they arrived The materials starting from? (the drywall and studs). It also had to be assumed that they cut in the sewer so that they could free themselves. Had the bank's employees not complained about the smell all week? Hello! <br /> <br /> * After such a debacle; since the documents "had" fallen into the hands of the thief, what kind of "references" was Mrs. White who expected to get from the CEO of the bank, since now it had to be a target for blackmail, because of his failure? > <br /> * And last, but certainly not least, what is with the "Electric Glide" that Denzel did? AS STUPID! Should this indicate his "resolution" to bring these kids to justice? He looked rather like a man walking around on a shopping cart, trying to prevent a bowel movement! "Cheeee-Zheeee" !!!! <br /> <br /> In addition to the mediocre plot; horrible script; bad acting; and the compassionate general direction ...... yada, yada, yada. <br /> <br /> We hope this provides an in-depth view of the film to help others decide whether or not to waste their money! <br /> <br />.
