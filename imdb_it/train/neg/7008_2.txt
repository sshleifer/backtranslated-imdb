Annie Potts is the only highlight in this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really upset that someone has stolen the Corvette that he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (most likely the ugliest car to watch in a movie), and heads to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who stole his pride and joy. <br /> <br /> I would have tore my eyes off after seeing this if it wasn't for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a role very soon, and she's too bad for Hamill who didn't take some acting lessons from her . Danny Bonaduce also makes a funny cameo.
