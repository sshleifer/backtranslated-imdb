A huge disappointment of the writer Hamm and the director Dante. Their previous collaboration in the "Homecoming" of the first season was twisted and obscurely exhilarating in all the right ways. This mismanagement of an intriguing premise has left me perplexed. The alleged "payoff" that showed generic aliens extracting something from the brain of infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfactory and explained nothing. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial "cleansing" of the planet of its human infestation, why did they do it so sadistically and misogynistically? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus at Stephen King's "The Stand" instead of slaughtering females from the male population? I kept hoping that the episode would improve as I continued to watch it but it became more pretentious and absurd. The religious subtext seemed simply forced, but it was clear that Sam Hamm must have thought it was deep for the weight it gave him. I really like both Dante's and Hamm's work, but this was unwatchable.
