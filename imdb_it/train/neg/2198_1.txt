A scientist and his girlfriend are out driving when his speeding causes a traffic accident. He escaped unharmed but is beheaded. He saves his head, takes her home and keeps her alive (!!!!). Then he goes in search of models and strippers for the perfect head body. His lame assistant looks at the head that begins to speak and has a telepathic (or telepathic) connection to a deformed monster kept in the closet .... <br /> <br /> As you can see, this is pretty stupid stuff, but I had a certain fondness for this. When I grew up in the late 1970s, a local television station showed this film about 20 times a year (without exaggerating). They always showed it on a Saturday afternoon TV - not cut. Seeing this on TV was great! Explicit blood and cold blood along with a gruesome monster and a squalid sexploitation - who cares if it's good? Seeing it now I realize how bad this is. <br /> <br /> The acting is perfectly poor, the production values ​​are non-existent, the script is rather stupid and (apart from the gore, still quite disgusting) this is boring stuff. There is also a delicate fight between cats between two women and the monster, certainly large, in the end. Also add an ending that leaves a lot of things to lose. On the one hand, this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitative film. On the other hand his immense garbage. However, it is not a good film but it is a must to see (just for once) for fans of horror and smoking. <br /> <br /> Even the laughter of the head is rather disturbing. Notice the credits that give the wrong TITLE (calling it "HEAD you wouldn't die")!
