The point of Wolfe's original novel - indeed the whole point of the story - is that things happen because of a carefully calculated sense of convenience. The goal is survival within a particular type of lifestyle. The novel is full of malice. The only relationship that sounds emotionally true is that between Sherman and his daughter, Campbell, and that's just touched. Apart from that, everyone is out for what they can get in terms of publicity, power, money or self-magnification. <br /> <br /> Wolfe has been criticized for hitting every character and every social segment of New York City in the lead. His answer was a denial. After all, he lived in New York and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations, exactly the qualifications one would want in his resume to deny that he didn't like New Yorkers. (Wolfe holds a doctorate in American Studies from Yale and is not a maniac.) These alleged weaknesses are what made the novel memorable. No one was good. And Sherman McCoy broke up, a professional protester for social justice. The film throws away all this and imposes a moral framework on the story that simply does not fit. Wolfe did his homework. The novel was rooted in reality. Each event was not only possible but completely credible. Wolfe could have become a great cultural anthropologist - he knows how to get into a system and record his details. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of us may have found ourselves, like Sherman and his mistress, blocked the South Bronx, threatened by a couple of black kids, and on the run after running into one of them. That scene is neatly transferred from the print to the celluloid. <br /> <br /> But after that scene the film does not seem to trust its audience and sometimes becomes frantic in its attempt to unravel its message, however nebulous the message is. <br /> <br /> Sherman could accidentally hit a child and be arrested for this as in the novel, but not immediately after his release from prison he returns to his expensive apartment, pulls out a rifle, and starts shooting at the ceiling with it, as it does in the film. In what should be a fun scene, the ceiling plaster falls on all the guests of the party and they run away, screaming. It simply wouldn't have happened. The film has left the inexpressibly detailed reality of the novel in the dust. Wolfe's sensitivity, the work he put into capturing the real, has been lost. What we get is instead a noisy, fantastic and silly scene that does nothing but wake up the public. Similar empty scenes follow, shouting for Wolfe's verisimilitude. <br /> <br /> The film also fails because it pushes a lot of sin and redemption into a fun story of moral nihilism. Here we see "Don Juan in hell" at work. We receive lessons on redemption from a poet with HELP. We see a lot of guilt in Sherman. A black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of these last speeches about how we should start behaving well again. A journalist who feels sorry for Sherman after turning it into a sacrificial lamb. And a happy ending in which Sherman takes off breaking the law with an idiotic smile. The scene is set in the film like a jester cap on the head of a circus elephant. <br /> <br /> The film not only makes points that are already trivial and unoriginal, it overestimates them, as if the public were unable to absorb subtleties. <br /> <br /> It is not the acting or the direction that is poor. The film is not bad in these respects. And the photograph is also quite good, including two rather spectacular shots: the gargoyles of the Chrysler building and the landing of the Concordia. It is the script that is completely stained. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film, roughly, is good for conception and execution. It keeps some of the little details of the novel. Sherman and Judy's dog is called Marshall. Who the hell would call a Marshall dog? He loses his attention almost completely in the second half and on the whole it is hardly worth looking at. <br /> <br /> Cynic Wolfe's right wing could be offensive to many people, but he has the cojones to depose his perceives. Unfortunately, writers and producers did not have the courage to collect them and so they took the opportunity to do a fascinating study on New Yorkers.
