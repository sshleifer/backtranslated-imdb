Not as bad as some are making it, although obviously pathetic compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was as exceptional as the bad Babban Singh - he tries not to compare to Gabbar in the original because clearly they were not going to the same effect. Apart from some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the film is imperfect. The development of the character was poor and the development of the story was hopeless, with many gaps and missing pieces of information that I would not have known if I had not read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the film was the supporting roles of Nisha Kothari and in particular of this new guy called Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoying from the moment her lips open for the first time. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where did he come from and why was he present in the movie studio for anything other than serving drinks? His acting ability is zero and he has the same tone, expression of dialogue and convinced expression in every scene, be it action, comedy or even a scene in which someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expressions have changed, which is more than I can say for his partner's mistake. Overall, RGV's Aag deserves to be admired for Amitabh's solid performance and also for a screaming Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
