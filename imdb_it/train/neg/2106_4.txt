Bela Lugosi is big as usual, but the film is nothing compared to Dracula. He is probably the only one who has played a perfect role in this film, but not even a legend like Lugosi could save the wickedness of the idea of ​​this film and, unlike many old nonsensical horror films, this film does not create the atmosphere very well. Even in the worst case, any Bela movie is just mediocre.
