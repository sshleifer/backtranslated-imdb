For anyone not familiar with c.S. Forrester's book this film should be interesting. It's colorful, well acted and represents a high-level adventure, but for those of us who know the original stories it's terrifying. I can hardly make it. <br /> <br /> For some reason the writers seem obliged to rewrite the stories they are working on. Of course, the word is different from the written word, and there are some episodes that would be difficult to film. But why do writers rewrite history instead of simply adapting it? In this case the writers did it themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: there was no mutiny on the Renown. The officers took control of the ship after the Captain-insane was completely mad when he fell from a hatchway for implicit but never given reasons. There was no court martial. The court of inquiry was conducted in an almost congratulatory atmosphere. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower saga, nor Col. Ortega's wife. Hornblower, himself, was never in prison or on the ship or on land. There are many manipulations of Forrester's story. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical basis, I think the repeated use of the flash-back film hurts the continuity of the story. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why do writers have to ruin a good story?
