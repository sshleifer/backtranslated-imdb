Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plots (Ghostbusters, Evolution) come to life in his skilled hands. Even his occasional flop (Six Days, Seven Nights) shows signs of life and humor that make him worth seeing. So I was disappointed that Reitman couldn't take a fairly original storyline (the man unloads the superhero, the superhero gets a super-powerful revenge) and turns it into something nice. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in uselessness. The one-trick pony plot is long in the tooth after the first 20 minutes. The film cannot decide whether to be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. The result is a film with flip-flops between both, without either aspect being done well. Uma Thurman is at the top, as usual, and even Luke Wilson withdraws from his role, even though his lazy antics get tired quickly. What is even more exasperating is that, in certain scenes (such as when a very hot Uma hits a headboard through a wall), you hear a dull witty Reitman, practically screaming, to go out. But a few seconds later, the magic is lost, vanished as fast as the superheroine, whose films disappoint almost anyway.
