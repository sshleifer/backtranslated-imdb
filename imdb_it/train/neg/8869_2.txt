With the release of "Farligt förflutet", the Swedish film industry has hit the bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has lived a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund) in recent years. One day an old friend of Stefan arrives with a favor to ask him. Stefan has to do a little courier job. He should carry a suitcase full of heroin through the Sweden-Germany customs. Unfortunately things in Germany don't work as expected and Stefan is in big trouble now. It's always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family drama model. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a film should be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be catastrophic. The content can be concluded with: bad acting, inconsistent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only salient point of the film is the unprovoked sexual scene with the incredibly beautiful Queen Lund. This lasts only a few seconds, leaving about 90 minutes of pure, let's say what it really is, shit.
