This film is so stupid that it just goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to see "Darkness falls" actually and I thought this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I advanced as fast as I could and still couldn't get rid of the boring moments. I only envy people who have been paid to play or work on this film. Actually, money was given for this shit. Is not it fantastic? I mean, in this film a man is killed and cut into pieces of blood in a wood grinder and a few minutes later the mother and child talk quietly at the table as if nothing had happened and drank coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for movies like that? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was lame. It is not scary at all and it was obvious that he is a bored stuntman wearing a badly made make-up.
