This film of swords and flying fists rather formidable is a good demonstration of the talents of John Woo. Cinematography is excellent and some of the sword work is truly remarkable. Unfortunately the film faces the weight of a boring story and an incredibly low budget (check out some set fight scenes if you doubt me). However, it is worth seeing, especially if you can take it in letterbox.
