I own this movie. Not by choice, I do it. I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. So I put it in the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying "why God why?" The plot was not so bad, as a player that I could appreciate. I think maybe if you like the romantic scenes of super geeks, you'll like this movie. "I've always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know as Dr. Spock ... unable to love" There are few positive things to say about this film, it's really horrible. But if you're making a really bad movie this is the one for you !!! The real story is much more interesting though;) <br /> <br /> If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be: <br /> <br /> LAME
