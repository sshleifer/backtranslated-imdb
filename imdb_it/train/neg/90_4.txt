: Spoiler: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy. I waited a long time to see it and finally got the chance to air on Hallmark Thursday night. I love the first three films "Love" but this was nothing like I thought it would be. The whole film was sad and depressing, there were many ways and the editing was very poor - for many scenes out of context. I also think that the death of little Kathy happened very early and that the appearance of Clarks in the film didn't seem to fit. It seemed that none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all emotionless. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie. <br /> <br /> I think the writers should have gone closer to the book. It seems that every film that has been made so far slips further and further away from the writings of Janette Oke. In the film, they never mentioned anything about the mine and the two boys or Clark who got hurt because of that. And I think Missie and Willies' reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and listened to rather than just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far I should say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope the next four films will follow more than the book and if the Clarks character is in them, I hope that he has a bigger part and I hope his part is not so bland. I also hope that there are more Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the writers will have in store.
