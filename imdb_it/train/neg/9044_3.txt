I really wanted this film to like it, but so much is stolen / borrowed from other jobs - some of the loans are painfully cheeky. The New York Times review showed that their singing frog is terribly reminiscent of the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ("Hi darling, hi my darling", hello my girl ragtime ...). But I challenge anyone to watch the animated film Fox / Blue Sky Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: plot - A young inventor who grows up and a single innovative company distributes all the great inventions. <br /> <br /> urban landscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic urban environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - The robot servant of the Robinson family has a design very similar to those in Robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look. <br /> <br /> This all seems to be in sharp contrast to the hateful Disney quote at the end, which implies that the company has been a constant innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were practically clones of each other, with some minor changes to the plot and ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The directors seem unable to let the story speak for itself, and instead it constantly sends objects and noises that fly in our direction, as also if we don't have the attention for nothing less. <br /> <br /> The bad is really well designed and brilliantly animated, and it is a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems to be thrown together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-1990s. <br /> <br /> The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. animated, we are reminded that Disney has never had much interest in innovation or good storytelling - they seem to think that simply getting something on the big screen is sufficient proof of their virtue.
