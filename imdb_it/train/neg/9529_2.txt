This 1977 cult movie has two crazy lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) that appear in the home of the wealthy doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping to help find a residence they don't seem to find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they find out that George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, binding the George, killing a bellhop while they destroy the place all in one night. Bizarre and disturbing films, but the two only come to reward the same bizarre way in which the film ends. Most will not love it immediately or will be caught in this ridiculous movie after about 30 minutes from the start. In any case, some consider this a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
