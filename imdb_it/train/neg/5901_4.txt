Something to Sing About was produced at the Grand National Studios where James Cagney was working while in a contract dispute with the Warner brothers. He made two films for this B studio, none of which tops Cagney's titles. <br /> <br /> One of the great losses to the cinema is the fact that Jimmy Cagney has made so few films that he used his fantastic dance skills. The two that immediately come to mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two minor films are The West Point Story and Never Steal Anything Small. Cagney himself said he was not used to watching anything other than his retired musicals. So why did so few? <br /> <br /> Well, that was all wrong. The plot of Something to Sing About concerns a hoofer heading for a band that has discovered and given a film contract. There are the usual complications of a head of the conniving office and of a fellow press agent, interpreted respectively and well by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley. His contract requires a non-marriage clause, so Cagney and singer Evelyn Daw secretly marry. So we get the complication of a studio love story advertised with the protagonist Mona Barrie. I think you can understand where it's going. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing thing about Something to Sing About is the lack of dance numbers for Cagney. She dances briefly at the beginning and end of the film and nothing in between. Evelyn Daw had a beautiful singing voice and the charisma of a ham sandwich. He took the musical numbers as they were. I'm sure the cinema audience was paying for tickets to see Cagney's dance. <br /> <br /> Besides, besides giving him dance numbers, a female dance partner would have been nice. He danced well with Ruby Keeler on the Footlight Parade and with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day on The West Point Story. Weren't Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell or Ruby Keeler available? <br /> <br /> No memorable songs came out of this. And Daw's voice is also for life. He has a soprano voice from Jeanette MacDonald who was so out of place with a swing band. <br /> <br /> No wonder Cagney ran back to Warner Brothers. But they should have given him some decent musicals.
