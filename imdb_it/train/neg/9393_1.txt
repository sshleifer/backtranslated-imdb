Really, really, abysmally, incredibly, horrible. But actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) competently engages as an actor. It is the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare pleasure, for five minutes, if you want to fathom depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, Southern California as "the moon" (again and again and again), and thus behaving in inept wood that it could be a parody. . . except that it is clear that it is not - no humor here, if not involuntarily. <br /> <br /> The dialogue could be worse than any other aspect and customs. . . well, quite said. To track? What plot? Bad guy (well, bad head) and his henchmen, including his land agent called Krog (listen carefully or suspect that this is a parody of the name of the founder of McDonald's Ray Kroc) and his incredible pistachios (which, however, have guns that never need to reload, as well as Commando Cody, so there are numerous detachments on fire). <br /> <br /> Enjoy yourself.
