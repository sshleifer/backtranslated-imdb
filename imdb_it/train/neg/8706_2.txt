If this is the first time you are experiencing the wonders of cinema, if you have never seen an "Image in motion", you will think that this film is the son of the gods. BUT if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney the dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed with this movie. Heck Barney the dinosaur was even more realistic than the dinos in this film. <br /> <br /> Now I like the B movies. I just saw "The Giant Gila Monster" right before I watched this, and I really enjoyed that movie. It works like a B movie. It has a Lamer dialogue, hokier acting, cheesier effects and an absurdly honest Gila Monster as a monster! Carno 3 does not contain much of the punch of a B movie. It has some blood, and that Polchek boy comes close to being funny sometimes, but this movie is overwhelming, almost flaccid. It's the little engine that couldn't be dinosaur films. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people may observe the drying of tires on a sidewalk and feel entertained. If you are one of those people, then give this film a shot.
