Cavemen were by far the biggest shit load I've ever wasted looking at. This show based on Geico ads is less fun than an actual 30 second ad for Geico. The trick was half disguised, hard to imagine a caveman with perfect white teeth, even after he went to the dentist. This show could have had a potential for a fun series if they could get cast from the commercials, which in themselves represent a bad show. Perhaps if the authors were the same as Geico's ads, this could have a chance, instead the pilot lacked a good plot. To give this show 1 in 10, I'd like to put a zero on 10, but it wasn't an option. I pray for a quick death at this show, I would give less than 5 episodes before a worthy death dies.
