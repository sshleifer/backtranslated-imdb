Naming the absolutely pathetic piece of shit in the history of cinema is not an easy task, the candidates are so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my favorite since I saw it. It was so funny that we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard that I was literally rolling on the floor. (This usually happens only when I see "Scott of the Antarctic" by Monty Python.) <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, an overwhelming feeling that fascinates the viewer. I am completely confused by the fact that this clumsy home video has never reached the production stage. It should be a sequel, yet it has no apparent connection with the first film. The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a female, even though it took half the movie to stop guessing, with all the muscle and the nomad-barbarian costume! <br /> <br /> it is not a plot at all, it is simply a prolonged hunting scene, only that it is so slow and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it much more interesting than it actually is. There is almost no dialogue, which is equally valid considering the quality of it, and then the film suddenly ends abruptly after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions, without ever really explaining what it was. Fortunately, it never gets boring, because there is always something stupid and fake! <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually boring, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect mix of excessive seriousness and total unintentional nonsense that is really fun. Rent this movie or buy it too, you won't be disappointed!
