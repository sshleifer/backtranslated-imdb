I saw this movie when I was really small. It is by far one of the strangest films I've ever seen. Now, normally, I like strange movies, but this was just a little too much. <br /> <br /> There isn't much plot for the film. If nothing else, it starts like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to save their new friend, Babette. From there, madness follows. There's the Greedy, the Looney, a sea monster called Gazooks, and a group of pirates who sing show tunes, which made the film more strange. Besides, I can't help thinking that Babette is annoying and a little too whiny. It certainly didn't help the film. <br /> <br /> Now, although I didn't like this film, there were some nice parts. I liked the camel song. Even though it was a song about being alone, it had a friendly atmosphere. Then there was Sir Leonard. While most Looney were simply crazy, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the most fun. King Koo Koo was just a small earthen bag that made Dr. Evil a real villain. Also, there was the Raggedy Andy song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely a good song for the kids who wanted to play hard. But honestly, these things didn't improve the film either. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> Even if I personally wouldn't recommend this movie, I also have to admit that it has its fascinating moments. Look at it if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something "really" out of the ordinary.
