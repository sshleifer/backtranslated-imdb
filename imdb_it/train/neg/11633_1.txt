If you could give ZERO the stars for this, but unfortunately I have to give it ... <br /> <br /> There isn't a single scene I could laugh at ... but the game didn't make me laugh either. So, if you are a retarded sick people, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars, as some have already done. <br /> <br /> but for me ... in a movie where children are killed to achieve humor ... good taste goes beyond the limit ... this was the third time I lost my time to watch a Boll movie and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I am ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE, PLEASE KEEP THEM TO MAKE MORE FILMS !!!!!
