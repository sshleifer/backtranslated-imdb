This is a 1974 German film that has something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that, I can't really tell you their purpose or even what the film's purpose is. I can tell you that there are many women who also have night work as servants in this particular castle who undress, put on body paint and turn to the bongos as if they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, though, and that seems to be a good portion of the running time of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there are girls about girls, etc., but the main attention seems to be that of the painted girls who wander off into the basement. I liked a bit like the rolling of the eyes of one of the main rulers / worshipers of the devil, who lent a process to authenticity and made it even more wicked. Was Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as indicated in the credits)? It does not matter. If you're not too fussy about your lesbian devil adoring movies, you might like it, otherwise it's boring and I couldn't even finish it, I was so bored. 3 out of 10.
