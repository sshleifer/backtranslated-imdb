This is the worst movie I've ever seen. All those involved should be embarrassed. All. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely horrible and hokie doesn't begin to describe the performances of every single actor in this film. The plot is heavily subtracted from the executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, the executive decision is the Academy Award material. I've never been so disappointed watching a movie. Air Rage should be burned with its ashes locked up at once to avoid seeing the light of day. Anyone who has seen it should take a shower and wash away the smell of a horrible movie. The best part of this film probably comes from the ending, when the titles were launched. This was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to Law and Order, and other people in this film should retire early or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to be back in a movie.
