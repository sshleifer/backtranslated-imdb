I had never read the novel by Gary Paulsen, Hatchet, for which "A Cry in the Wild" is the adaptation of, so I can't make comparisons with the book. However, I will say that as a stand-alone film, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no important explanation for its few characters. <br /> <br /> Think of "A Cry in the Wild" as' a less luxurious teenage mountaineer (it was Quincy, California, the only place where this?) version of 'Cast Away'. Jared Rushton is 13-year-old Brian Roebson, a child with his head on a small plane to visit his father, until the boat crashes into desert mountainous terrain, leaving the boy stuck for a while and having to defend himself. <Br /> <br /> There are basically three parts to the film. The obvious is the introduction of ten or fifteen minutes of the characters, namely Brian and his mother. <br /> <br /> The third next in the film (which consumes almost the entire film) is that of Brian "roughing it". These scenes do not contain particularly surprising actions, nothing spectacular except a lot of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape. Nothing to test you, no real encounter (except a lively confrontation with a puppy), and no important dilemma to start some sort of fun or connection with the character on the screen. You might also feel a little bored with the passage of time as we assist Brian to manage his situation through the first, primitive means, and then the more perfected ones (using the tools, etc.) for his survival. It's more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that's rather about it. In other words, they didn't give weight to Paulsen's words when they translated them into visual support. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part of the film is his rescue. <br /> <br /> There is a subplot that continually tries to make itself known during this period, however. Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky and embarrassing relationship between them. However, for the most part, it is explained only in short, intermittent, minimal flashbacks of dialog boxes that look more like a backstory for a music video. Every minute, the singer of Jefferson Starship, should start singing "Sara". In addition to what the observer can draw from the implications, or guess for his need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped backward story that was probably necessary to enjoy at least a part of this film and create a connection with the film . characters, regardless of whether it really had anything to do with Brian's survival adventure in the third part of the film. These are the defects in the narration that through the spectator in a state of torpor as he struggles to find out what the hell those people are doing on the screen and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming on television to say something and Tell me more! <br /> <br /> It certainly wasn't a good adventure story for me. But, for Jared Rushton fans, it was one of the last films he made. So look at it only for nostalgia, if nothing else.
