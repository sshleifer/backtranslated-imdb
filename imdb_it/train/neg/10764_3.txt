I will give credit to writer / director William Gove for finding someone to fund this ill-conceived "thriller". A good argument for not wasting money by subscribing to HBO, not to mention buying DVDs based on covers and blurb. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a Richard Grieco game do not add anything significant to their curriculum, even if the art direction is not bad. The dialogue will let you make faces of amazement at his presumption; this is the narrative at its worst. No tension, no suspense, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, nothing at all. Some attractive and often naked women liven up boredom, but this is definitely a movie seen as a trailer. I'm sorry for the guy who brought this thing out. Only good for late night night vision. You have been warned.
