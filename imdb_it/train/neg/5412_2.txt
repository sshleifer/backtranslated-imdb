Pyare Mohan can easily be included in the blacklist of one of the worst films ever made by mankind. The film, one of the many films of disabled people that arose after Black's phenomenal success, makes a mockery of the brotherhood of the handicapped. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are simple caricatures of handicapped people. While Black painted the intensity and emotions of a disabled woman and gave us a taste of his world, Pyare Mohan shows two desperado-like monkeys that have no qualms about being handicapped and conquering half the world to protect their love interests . Anu Malik's music is quite clear. Vivek Oberoi, who has promised well with Saathiya, is unfortunately rapidly losing his balls in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan has never been an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are just beautiful damsels in distress who have nightmares in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the aforementioned desperados. Boman Irani, like the evil Don Toni, is somehow acceptable. Avoid the movie if possible.
