I had high expectations on this film (the title, translated, is "How we get rid of others"). After all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequences of the constant verbal and legislative persecution of the right-wing government over the so-called "freeloaders" and the left wing in general, and has decided to kill all those who cannot prove that they are contributing something to the establishment (the establishment is called "the common good", but in reality it means the interests of the dominant capitalist ideology). <br /> <br /> Great idea! Ideal for biting satire! Only, this movie completely explodes its possibility. The satire comes out only in some scenes and shows of absurdity, but this satire is not supported; he is neither sharp nor witty. And for an alleged comedy, the film has almost no funny scenes. The comedy, I assume, should be in the absurdity of situations, but situations are largely uncomfortable and too serious, rather than evoking laughter or thoughts. <br /> <br /> The script is full of serious layout errors. The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead a great deal of time is spent on a young woman who was the one who wrote the new laws for fun, and who is looking for to save everyone by organizing a resistance that sends people to Africa. All this is out of the question! A film like this should not pretend to be so serious! It's a satire! A political declaration. But it does not even begin to actually address the problem it should address. Maybe he was afraid of going too far? How cowardly. That is not art. It is not even a real satire. <br /> <br /> SÃ¸ren Pilmark, very serious and now one of the absolutely senior Danish actors, was very good. It largely brought that little entertainment value of the movie. Everyone else: nothing special (well, maybe except for Lene Poulsen, who provided a convincing performance). <br /> <br /> In fact, one problem with most Danish films is that the language never seems natural. Neither the wording nor the delivery. Why is it so hard to make it look right? Why does it have to be so rigged and artificial? I hope that when people watch these films in fifty years, they don't think this is the way people talked in general Danish society. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
