What a disgrace! I was verifying it hoping that it would be a gem of James Garner yet to be discovered and that it stank turned out to be! The quality of the production was fine, but the plot was undeniably lame and I can honestly say that it's only a couple of hours older and much more stupid now. The film actually had no salvific qualities and if this kind of thing continues to come out, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it is, it's nothing, and in this case, it's not a good thing. We are subjected to looking at an old woman who is one of the stupidest creatures ever to roam the earth, who seems to be married to a real treasure that is probably the only person alive who could stand it. She drags him into one trouble after another, puts him in an embarrassing situation after another, and is proud of himself all the time. So the movie ends. What a relief! It's not worth the time to see it, so do yourself a favor and skip this, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this is.
