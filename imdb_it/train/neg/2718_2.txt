This is the least disturbing film I've ever seen. How the blob manages to eat anyone is the biggest mystery of the movie. The blob moves so slowly that an o.a.p in a zimmerframe could escape. The blob has a big slice of luck that meets a typical horror movie woman who instead of running away stays still for half an hour so she can be eaten. If you have not seen this film that I advise you to do, it is too funny to be taken seriously.
