Cruel Intentions 2 is basically Cruel Intentions 1, again, just badly done. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some of the lines), with a few exceptions. The cast is more unknown and decidedly less talented. Instead of being seductive and luring me to look at him, I ended up feeling dirty because he compared to watching soft-core porn. I'm not sure if to blame some of the idiot jokes of actors or writers ... and I always feel bad to say it, because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a double ... Now waste of my life. It literally surprises me that some films are made, and this is no exception ... I can't believe they would make a third.
