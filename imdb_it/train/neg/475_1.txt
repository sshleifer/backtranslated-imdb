One of the most disgusting movies I've ever seen. I wanted to throw up after seeing it. I saw this film in my lesson on American history and the aim was to see an incitement to the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s. What we saw were the pigs being shot and then slaughtered, the human birth, the brand name. Oh and finally there was a birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't so bad, but the many liquids that came out of it brought many people to my bathroom class. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move west to be a keeper of this cowboy. They live a life of unease and it is interesting a fairly accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800s. But if you have a choice, don't see this movie.
