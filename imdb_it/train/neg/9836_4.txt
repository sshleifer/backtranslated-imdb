John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are adventure companions heading for the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a fairly loyal competitor, but finds that, unless he is willing to accept twenty-five cents on the cash money from a dishonest promoter, he will have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. Quite coincidentally, the bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide he would like the rest of the rodeo; they shoot promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it appear that Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /> <br /> Wayne and Chandler use a gag in the movie where they are going to do it with fists for various platitudes.
