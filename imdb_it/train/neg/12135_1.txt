Although 2 years have passed, I still remember the complete waste that includes the entire plot of the film. Unfortunately, I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new versions of Blockbuster. We decided to choose the film because it was the only one we hadn't seen and it seemed fun. Although it has been a while since I saw the film, I still remember the lack of plot (seriously, there is no real plot) and the complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie. If you're in the video store and this movie catches your eye, walk and find a better movie. If you're done watching this movie, I understand your pain :)
