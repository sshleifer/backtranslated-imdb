What a waste! This film could have really been something decent, but writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather superficial and uninteresting. Mike Meyers was good, and the historical reconstruction of the decadence of the 70s was well done, but overall this film was a great waste of time. Instead, the film to watch, which deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.
