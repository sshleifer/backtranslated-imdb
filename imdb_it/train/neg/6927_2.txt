Although I rated this film a 2 to show a total lack of effort in trying to create a quality horror, it was a 10 on the involuntary entertaining scale. I couldn't understand what was happening in the movie or who the people were, but I didn't care because I knew that every scene would have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the film, but I think it's because they started shooting without a script. The fact that there is no graphic plot makes the film extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you look at it rewinding you will be confused with the fun. I particularly like the scene where inmates are taking turns running outside, beating each other with chopsticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as a treatment. Genius!
