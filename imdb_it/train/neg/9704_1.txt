Okay, if you have a couple of hours to lose, or if you really hate your life, I'd say watch this movie. If anything, it's good for a few laughs. Not only do you have obese, topless natives, but also such bad special effects that they are probably outlawed in most states. Seriously, the "PG" rating is pretty funny, once you see the extravagance of native porn. I wouldn't give this movie to my late nephew. Nor can this be shown to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. The plot is sketchy, and clich√©, and stupid, and stupid. The acting is horrible, and the ending is so painful to watch that I actually started pouring salt into my eyes just to divert attention from the idiocy that filled my TV screen.
