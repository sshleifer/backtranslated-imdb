I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First of all I want to say that the story of this film and the creation of the Amber Alert system are good. However the film itself was badly done and the acting was terrible. The biggest problem I had with the film involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and father Glenn Park. The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. At that time my father suffered from psychological disorders and he picked up Nichole with no intent to harm her. He loved her as a daughter and was under the mentality that he was saving her from some sort of harm or neglect that he probably believed came from his mother who paid little attention to her for over 3 years when my father took care of her and summarily he lifted her so that her mother could have fun. The film painted my father in a way that could hurt her in some way shape or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my father's house, while Sharon worked or did what he was doing. The reason that it was originally thought that my father was violent was that he had objects that could be conceived as weapons on his truck. My father was a landscape architect. The objects they considered to be weapons were tools of landscape that kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is to take this film with a pinch of salt, it's a good story and based on real events, however the details of the film (at least the part of Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park) are largely inaccurate and describe the director's failure discover the truth in telling the story. The funny thing is that if the director had interviewed some of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, he would have said exactly what I posted here.
