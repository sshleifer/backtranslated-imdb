First let me tell you that the first 20 minutes are fantastic, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. Too bad then that the rest of the film is so disappointing, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS UNDER ******** <br /> <br /> From the scene of opening we can see this film is anti-American, normally this kind of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we Brits gain enough from Hollywood) but here it is not subtle in making stupid Americans deficient. Overcome the point of view of realism and your left wonders if a Yank has raped the mother of the directors. <br /> <br /> The mourning scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts to go down. <br /> <br /> Here we are presented with the aunt of the Olympic medal and the drunken uncle who enters the memorial and begins to blame the father of the death of his daughters, and then hit him before everyone starts to roll on the floor crying. Unrealistic bond in a moment of crisis! <br /> <br /> The entire lateral line of the virus is ridiculous. If Americans know there is no virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources to investigate? The agent of the United States government orders the cerebral perforation of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look evil (or stupid), he was not helped by the fact that this boy was cross-eyed for comic effect. <br /> <br /> The film is about monster hunting. The US and Korean special forces are in charge of finding the creature although they are invisible through the film. The only people who hunt the monster, all over Korea, are the main family and a random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Of course some US / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was included in the film only to be able to make the vital blow in the end. It was a clich√©, you knew it would happen, but to make it worse, it did all the harm up to that point! and my last annoyance, how the hell did that kid survive in the end? the monster had swum with his head underwater for about 5 minutes! why didn't the monster eat the kids in the first place?
