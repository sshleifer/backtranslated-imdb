Even his first statement, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious. <br /> <br /> When a Jehovah Witness refuses get his documentary on the movies ?? or something - it's time for anyone to have their own. Although much, much smarter than, say, Paris Hilton (I know, not too difficult) Zizek's mouth spits as much as his own, a different kind. It combines the worst of both its professional worlds: psychoanalysis and philosophy. Both fields are famous for conveniently offering the opportunity to create unprovable theories, to challenge without a beginning or an end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process of abusing the English language creating a semantic mixture only a mother can love . Example: there are three main Marx brothers from which a "great" idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, id, ego and super-ego. I'm rather surprised not to have reproduced a clip from "Snowhite" and to make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of Gahannah (the Muslim hell). It's like the premise of "The Number 23" by Schumacher: play with numbers long enough, and you can invent any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking the Ancient Greeks to the death of Princess Di. <br /> <br /> However, there is an element of entertainment for TPGTC: to watch a crazy sudatic sweating like a pig while speaking of masked deliriums while intellectual analysis can be a lot of fun. Why watch "Cuckoo's Nest" or any other madhouse drama when you can have Zizek for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train accident. Sure, it's almost funny on one or two occasions. <br /> <br /> I have always been disoriented by people who are desperately trying to elevate the creation of a film into a high intellectual social science. Giving this kind of idiotic films like "Birds" this thought, so this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. The raw truth is that the vast majority of films have zero intellectual value, and those who have some intelligence do not require an invented philosopher to draw a map to understand them? unless you're a complete idiot. Zizek sees levels and layers of meaning in the most banal films. Hallucinogenic drugs must be quite popular and cheap in Slovenia these days ... <br /> <br /> When Zizek showed the hole in the bathtub in the "Psycho" shower scene, I thought he was going to say something about the holes galactic blacks; how they take life out of the stars just as the bathtub hole sucks Janet Leigh's blood. Or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents Leigh's vagina, with the blood flowing in and out (as in menstruation), this represents a sort of "ironic (Zizekian) ironic". By the way, the real irony is that if Hitchcock had really put so much thought into every scene (and script), his films wouldn't have been the illogical and far-fetched crap they are often. The point of these analogies with the hole in the tub was to show how easy it is to improvise on "hidden and deep meanings". And when you add Zizek's extravagant terminology from philosophy and psychology, superimposing these terms on these analogies like decorations for wedding cakes, you get a confusion that can immediately impress the ignorant, that is, the easy impressionable and the naive. <br /> <br /> Zizek utters a series of (unintentionally) fun things here, one of the most absurd ideas is when he associates the cleaning of Anthony Perkins's bloody bathroom with "job satisfaction, a job well done". Don't laugh ... Neither Hitchcock nor the "Psycho" writer could have even vaguely caressed this idea that Perkins could have enjoyed a job well done - cleaning a blood-stained toilet - while they were conceiving / directing that scene . Talk about putting words in your own (dead) mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to "say". I like Zizek's initial reflections on Tarkovsky's fantastic "Solaris", but then he ruined a rare good impression by dragging "anti-feminism" and other nonsense into his theory. <br /> <br /> Zizek's attitude towards logic is that of a dog towards his plastic bone. "I just want to play with it all day!" Logic has its rules and should not be raped, at least not publicly, by people like him. It seems to consider logic, proof, common sense and reason as enemies or simple throwaway toys; concepts to avoid, distorted to adapt to the final goal or simply destroyed. Zizek is the LSD hippie, and all his favorite movies are his personal "2001". <br /> <br /> The fact that Zizek focuses too much on two of the most overrated directors - and those whose films often lack intelligence, if anything - like Hitchcock and Lynch, further diminishes its already low credibility. I was surprised that De Palma did not have a prominent role; this is another lame director who writes inept scripts. Zizek has a field day with Lynch's incomprehensible "Lost Highway". There are as many interpretations of that film as many people have looked at it. <br /> <br /> Zizek's comment that the viewer readily accepts, in "Dogville", the awakening, the ridiculous "ridiculous" physical approach of von Trier. <br /> <br /> However, Zizek does not just invent things while he goes on, but he abandons himself heavily to the "bleedin 'obvious". Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), it envelops its very trivial "observations" in articulated (if full of spit) and sometimes in complex language languages. After all, sociology works in exactly the same way: it makes us believe that we are listening to something new when in reality it is what we all already know, but told eloquently - which deceives the listener more unperceived. <br /> <br /> I almost expected men dressed in white to suddenly appear out of nowhere and tie him up in a suit and tie ... <br /> <br /> Slavoj Zizek: soon as a stalker in a park for children near <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
