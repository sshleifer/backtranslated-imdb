Don't let the assumption fool you: this was a fun movie. The problem - it didn't have to be a comedy. History prepares you well for an ending that never comes. Worse still, the set-up is NEVER explained. You will leave the theater asking "Is that so?" I consider it a 2 simply because there were some brief moments of promise, but the ending leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did a good job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are strange quirks and interesting twists everywhere, which have absolutely nothing to do with the film. Let's get this out on video before you waste your money.
