If you like to comment on the films in which the script comes in the middle of the film, this is the only one. A setting and acting like a porn movie but nothing is happening just a little groping and touching of the third type. That actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of feely delicate, but no action. Some of the actors I've seen in movies with real x and there their acting was much better. All the special effects are made by the great "Rond√≤" who does all the magic with his mind. A cult film is written on the box. Does this mean that this film should absolutely not be looked at ??? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on New Year's Eve thanks.
