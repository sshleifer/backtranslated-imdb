While it's worth watching a movie with Bruce Willis, it's better to skip this. I saw this on television, so I didn't have to waste money on it. Lucky me. <br /> <br /> The plot develops slowly, very slowly. Although the first 30 minutes are quite credible, it becomes more and more incredible towards the end. It is highly questionable if an experienced soldier like Lt. Waters disobey direct orders. And even if he wanted it, if the rest of his platoon would do it. They know that it puts them in direct danger, and they know that they will surely die if they follow him, but what the hell, he is our Lt. so we do what he says (despite direct orders, remember). <br /> <br /> However, there are some nice scenes in this movie. Somehow they save a village, where the total population is massacred by the rebels. Well, they saved a dozen villagers or so, the rest had already been killed. The strange part of this, that they took the trucks that the rebels left behind. They prefer to go on foot. Perhaps because the roads are not safe, but there were no explanations. Anyway. I think this is what the film deserved, the only point I gave. <br /> <br /> What has made this film an insult to the brain and therefore absolutely incredible is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill so many rebels without being hurt or killed. Only towards the end do some companions lose. And that's just because they have to fight an army of nearly 500 or more. Can you believe it? <br /> <br /> They fight an army of so many, kill hundreds of them and lose only a few. And they have rounds and rounds of ammunition. Never finish. Grenades and clay mines, an M60 machine gun and even a GDR. Where do they get this stuff? Bringing it or what? They even have a laptop showing them the activity of the enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that goes on for days. Really? Who thinks of this shit. I imagine that if you completely shut down your brain and accept that the rebels are a group of idiots, give this film a high score. If not, skip this. It saves you time.
