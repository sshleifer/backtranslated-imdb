Wow ... OK. So, after reading the little feud here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This film is HORRIBLE. I stopped watching it. I highly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie, you'll be more scared / entertained. <br /> <br /> It is a low budget with a negative acting. <br /> <br /> Anyone giving this 10s movie is completely wrong and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Simply put, this film is not worth looking at. > <br /> Very, very BAD FILM.
