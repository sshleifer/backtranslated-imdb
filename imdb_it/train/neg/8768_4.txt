Now please don't start calling me names like "unpatriotic", "weird" and more. <br /> <br /> The length of this film (4 hours ... !!!) is his biggest mistake. No editing - it seems that J.P. Dutta fell too much in love with her project. Lagaan also lasted 4 hours - but it was fun and also gave a message. <br /> <br /> It is based on real accidents and real people. Congratulations, but were the repetitive war scenes really necessary? Furthermore, attention was constantly shifting from one battalion / squadron to another and it was impossible to keep track of them all. <br /> <br /> Among the skirmishes were songs about loneliness, insensitivity and related things. There were funny conversations. At first it gave some relief from the violence, but it became so monotonous later that one could also correctly predict the nature of the upcoming speech. <br /> <br /> Why did the soldiers turn as if they were lions in the jungle, completely unaware that the enemy was lurking near somewhere? And when they were shot, he aroused sympathy, but in the first place they didn't seem to be so sure of their safety. <br /> <br /> The music was melodious and the text was full of feeling but did not fit the film. Better to listen to them on the soundtrack than in the film. <br /> <br /> Acting was the saving grace: from seasoned veterans like Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan, to neophyte relatives like Abhishek Bachchan and Akshaye Khanna, they all performed like a pro. Manoj Bajpai and Ashutosh Rana deserve a special mention to lighten the mood whenever necessary. <br /> <br /> The dialogues have ranged from the brilliant ("From Madhuri .. with Love !!") to illogical / monotonous ("Pakistan se zyada musalman Hindusthan mein hain"). And the expiratory madness consisting of all the MC, BC, C and F-words was not really required. <br /> <br /> LOC Kargil tries to provide adequate tribute to the brave Indian soldiers, but it tries too hard and eventually fails. The Indian soldiers certainly deserve a better tribute.
