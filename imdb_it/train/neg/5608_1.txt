I was curious to see this movie. Many people seem to be excited. I too have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I am open to any kind of opinion or opinion. It doesn't matter to me, if Jesus existed the way it is written in the Bible. Whether Mary was a virgin or not, or all other similar pagan coincidences. What matters to me is the idea of ​​salvation, the idea of ​​love as the only way to find peace in this world. <br /> <br /> What angered me is when someone takes a sentence, presents it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed the following sentence in this film: "Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they didn't say that is the context. Jesus told a story about a wicked king. There is no passage in the Bible where Jesus claims to kill. He is love! After quoting the wrong bible they present us with screaming people (pseudo-Christians) full of hatred. Most viewers don't check the information presented so they start thinking that Jesus = hate = not good for me or anyone else. This is pure manipulation. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as a fact telling you in this movie. We destroy our foundations, our civilization if we begin to dismantle Jesus in this way and the message that has brought us. You saw the branch you're sitting on.
