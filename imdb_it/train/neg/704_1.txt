A romantic novel about the sexual exploitation of black women in New Orleans by white men of power and privilege. Ooh. Does your appetite tease you? Well, then, go belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this free troll on a seamy story segment. For good measure, it is adapted from the book by the famous hack Anne Rice. The direction is as cloying and melodramatic as the fake dialogue. Most of the acting is amateur. The only noteworthy note of the production is that it employed practically a dozen black actors, who practically never worked in today's market (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that were seen barely (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). It is also, despite everything, an excellent showcase for Nicole Lyn. Even the pompous and ponderous James Earl Jones is at hand. Thus, it is the late Ossie Davis, a minimal talent who owes his success to having been affiliated with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This film should be rated "T" for tripe.
