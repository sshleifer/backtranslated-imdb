This is bad. A really bad and boring crime film that has nothing extraordinary. A series of crimes, the killer you don't see in the whole film, the classic investigations. And also the classic story of a policeman who understands what is happening and is not believed by anyone, so he has to fight alone to reveal the truth. Not too much in this. Rating: 4 out of 10.
