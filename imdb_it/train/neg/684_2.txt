I could not believe it! Cut phrases? Good grief! You know what? All true! Do real people ever talk like that? Don't think so. Good girl! Tired companion! Stiffen upper lip! Only motif given film 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a dish. The film as a whole is ridiculous, unless you like the endless dog and biplane duels. It seemed endless, though. Think of all the dialogues of Franchot Tone. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to look English, they come as Irish. Handy tip: we English, not sentences. And somehow we succeed in draaaaaaaawl at the same time. But this is only if we have been to a very good public school (which is private to you).
