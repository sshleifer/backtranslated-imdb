You could consider a couple of facts in the discussion as a spoiler. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but Spielberg didn't deserve to win any Oscars for this piece, and I think the Academy was right voting. (Other Oscar awards for best actor nominations and ... of which I know nothing, but it would be difficult to justify them, given what they were asked to do and what you see in the final product.) The way Spielberg directs this it's so invented, so intriguing. While watching this film, a distinction made during a course of Film as Art that I had taken was screaming at me: "Feeling is an honest emotion made honestly. Sentimentalism is sugary and unreal, a false vision of life". This is exaggerated sentimentality. When in real life two people start reading aloud in sync, how do Celie and Shug Avery when they sit on the bed reading Nettie's letters they found? There are examples of this kind of fake behavior throughout the film: all the men who crowd around Miss Millie's car and then jump in unison like a flock of birds taking off when she goes by car; Harpo falling through the roofs of various buildings he is working on (an economic slapstick gag); the whole party of revelers goes en masse to the chapel from the Jook Joint, magically enchanted by the singing of the choir ... and so on. Nothing sounds real. I even wondered if Harpo's name had been specifically chosen because it is the real name of his wife Sophia, "Oprah", backwards. Spielberg is not above this "sweetness". <br /> <br /> It's not like Spielberg is incapable of honestly making action and emotion. Schindler's List was amazing, deeply touching for me, and I also admire Saving Private Ryan for his realism, even if the story is a bit forced.
