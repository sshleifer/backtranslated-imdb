This film is extremely boring, tells the story of a female service station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really "kept reality" and looks just like a camera that follows a woman around while living her life. I had to watch other films by this director for a lesson, the others weren't boring. Also this film was seen for an assignment ... better to be worth the boredom with a good grade !! Overall, unless requested, don't watch the movie. But do not underestimate other films by this director, because they are not so bad ... and do not make discounts on other films on Africa, they are usually good, especially if made by a western director.
