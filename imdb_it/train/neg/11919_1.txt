this must be one of those movies where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself. I saw the trailer for the first time in 1991, it looked fantastic. Since then I have always wanted to see it but I would never have found it ... ..day today, yes, 14 years later. <br /> <br /> lets just say that I was so disappointed with his unreal, OK I knew it would not be an Oscar winner but I still hoped it would be fun film without brains in the blood mold. Unfortunately no, it's Pooh <br /> what it is with all American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad that it was pretty scary. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were rubbish and this DVD only cost me £ 5 and I think I was overloaded with £ 7 <br /> <br /> Now I'm sad because I know I'll never get that one. is now half back.
