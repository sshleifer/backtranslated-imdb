OK, it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I was able to sit down and watch it TWICE !!! the plot was pretty awful and during the first part of the first story I wondered what the hell I was looking at, but at the same time it was so terrible that I liked to laugh to say the least. <br /> <br /> And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that disappointed him was halfway stopped his silly name. <br /> <br /> Overall the film was pretty perfect but if you laugh cheaply and you see it in sterling earth it goes from it.
