Very silly film, full of stupid sheaths and Jewish references. It was a serious film but could not be taken seriously. A plot of family film ... Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. An atrocious subplot, which involves Kim Bassinger. Very robot and too regimented. I noticed that the acting skills of Al Pacinos seem to go downhill. A troubleshooting tool with problems, but nothing more worrying than the horrible Pacinos accent in Atlanta. Damage control must correct this damage of a movie. OK, my liners are bad, but not as bad as those in this movie. This film manages not only to be boring but also revolting. Usually a revolting movie is watchable for the wrong reasons. This film is unwatchable. I managed to sit through this. The plot, if written a little better, with, perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrific subplot, and even the stupidest chatter, could have brought this thriller out of depression. What remains is a boring and foolish film that made us believe that Eli Wurman was Jewish. An embarrassment for all good Jews around the world.
