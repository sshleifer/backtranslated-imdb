I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it in our class many years ago. And I read it to all my third and fifth grade classes in my last 18 years of teaching. Presumably a film had been made in the past, but I had never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were so excited when we learned that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> While watching the film, I had my highest hopes. As the film progressed, I became increasingly discouraged. They had hurt him! I had never been so disappointed by a favorite book-to-film adaptation. I understand that movies cannot strictly adhere to a book, but they don't need to change things for the sake of it! Most, if not all, departures from the book were absolutely useless! <br /> <br /> I kept my opinion of myself at the beginning and simply listened to my students discussing the film. Well, it wasn't just me. Almost everyone felt the same way - betrayed by the great story that Madeline L'Engle had so cleverly created! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why couldn't Calvin's hair be red? Why does Mrs. Che not have the "witch dress" that was such a clever game on her name? Basically, we all asked ourselves: why was it necessary to modify almost every single detail? <br /> <br /> I have always dreamed of how good a film of this book would be. I'm still waiting for that movie. This was A Wrinkle in Time in only the widest of the senses. I'll write to Peter Jackson and try to get him to do the job!
