Watching Marlen Brando on the screen is like watching a master carpenter chisel intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONLY thing that makes this film watchable. The plot is inane and ridiculous (not comic). The other big names seem to make desperate attempts to give the characters that represent a minimum of humanity ... these characters have the humanity of wet cardboard. Everything about the technical side of this film is mediocre or just awful. The director turns against the still image and the slow-motion footage with impunity. Incidental music is cartoonish and destroys any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I'm really looking for in a movie, but the closet was also far away. The venerable Brando could not look away from the horrible rags they had on him. I heard this movie called "David Lynch-esquire" and "irreverently funny" ... it's neither one nor the other. David Lynch's films are born of evil creativity: this film was not creative at all. And don't confuse irreverence with stupidity.
