Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why bother reviewing this movie? Another stupid dinosaur film in which top secret military guys discover those prehistoric deadly (and fake) monsters that run killing people in bloody ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. This falls somehow in the middle, although not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, macabre images and swear words.
