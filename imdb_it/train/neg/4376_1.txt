OK, the plot is, wait for me to bring you there, there's not a real and discernible plot here, just a series of optically blurred sex scenes, put together by scenes of photographers photographing beautiful women (sometimes a combination of the two ) Then a demon is killed men, rapes and kills women, and becomes poetic about the meaning of life. Moral special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside, you get what you expect from a movie with a title like this. I guess it should be somebody's cup of tea, but not mine since I have yet to see a good Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu movie. <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: Subtitles Interview with director Kazuo Komizu Part 1 (Part 2 is on the DVD of Entrails of a Beautiful Woman); and Theatrical Tailer <br /> <br /> My Grade: F
