Quite decent with some style images, however the small budget hinders things. I also got the impression that they were trying to surprise you with some of the graphic perv things about perv websites. <br /> <br /> if you like anime in particular things like cyber-city and AD police, then this could go up your way. <br /> <br /> but basically his low budget but not totally devoid of his style. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack of some unpublished grunge / punk / post grunge bands. It is worth checking if only for the soundtrack.
