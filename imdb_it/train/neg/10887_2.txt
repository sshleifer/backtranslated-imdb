...... this film is pretty horrible, the only thing that prevented me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that unfortunately I saw worse. <br /> <br /> Jungle music, stuttering demons, and UV / tooth / eye style fluorescent blood give him that "horrible" look, and the script is terrible ..... this film is more like a test to see how long you can resist before giving it up. It is also predictable, but not in a positive sense. Nothing about this film is in a positive sense. I looked at it 10 minutes ago and I thought I would do a little joke so here you are. (oh and the acting doesn't drop the movie, it's also terrible)
