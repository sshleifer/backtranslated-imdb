I really had trouble doing it through this move. He was extremely slow and sometimes wondered when the film's plot would actually appear. <br /> <br /> This film seemed to run slowly and I kept wondering when it would be over. I'm usually a person who occasionally likes a good independent file, but that didn't satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It looks like they tried to get a lot out of this movie. At one point he seemed to become a politician, of which I am not a big fan of movies. If you are looking for a slow motion movie with minimal plot or nothing, this is the right movie for you. As for me, I felt I was wasting 2 hours when I could do something else.
