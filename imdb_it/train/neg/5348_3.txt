Inventor Wayne Szalinsky (Rick Moranis) is preparing to donate his troubled expansion / expansion machine to the Smithsonian Institution as he and his wife Diane (Eve Gordon) prepare for a long weekend away from their son Adam (Bug Hall) . Wayne's brother, Gordon (Stuart Pankin), his wife Patty (Robin Bartlett) and his sons Jenny (Allison Mack) and Mitch (Jake Richardson) volunteer to look after Adam while his parents are absent, but fortunately he would like (and title would have led you to expect), adults are accidentally torn to pieces by the narrowing ray of Wayne. As the children go crazy, their miniaturized people must fight with monstrously huge insects, wrinkles on the carpet that look like canyons and other threats to them. This was bad, as are the video sequels, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves was ridiculous. I had to laugh at that "cockroach" movie Stuart Pankin and the party bullies were even more ridiculous, seen at your own risk!
