Caught this movie on Sunday's tube. I thought it was so bad that I searched on IMDb to see what others thought of it. I wasn't surprised by the amount of stupid people who liked this fluff. I was still surprised when I reviewed the comments to read the Hated It categories only to find that they were none. I was shocked by this; I always look at the hated because they are always the ones who hate a movie, no matter how beautiful it is. Somehow this film came out unscathed from the haters I say to this and I proudly proclaim that I HATE THIS FILM! I know I should go into details about why I hate this movie, but doing it this way would give this film more respect than it deserves.
