With this cast and budget you expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a number of films that border on the strange, yet still work. Neither he, nor his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this parody of ill-written junk banality. <br /> <br /> The film is nothing but a series of visual and poor gags. The plot goes nowhere, the writing is invented, meaningless and the characters very thin. If you think that a film is three-dimensional in which the story and the characters bring depth to the images, this skunk looks flat as a deadly steamboat. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's appearance in this brought to mind another truly terrible film, 1991's Nothing but trouble. Frankly, this film is the kind of project that kills careers and fires agents.
