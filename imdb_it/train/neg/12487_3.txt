This film was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I take the opposite view of the critics. It is no coincidence that the material is not up to the actors; here the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were great as Davis and Cagney, and look at how One Night happened: an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves he has no talent for comedy (to her it's just the only comedy I've ever experienced!) Davis's performance exudes petulance, but none of the nuances of Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night . Cagney, who was a great comedian, seems out of sync with his costar, Davis. The script offers some decent lines and gags, but the distribution seems more suited to drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suited to a light drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, handled more similar material more skillfully. In a fairly typical supporting role, Eugene Palette offers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role like an old western relic, Harry Davenport is very good. But in one of his poorest shows, William Frawley is rather irritating. The constant references of his character to the fictitious cops are a little effort of irony. <br /> <br /> I really like all these artists, and it's a shame that, as an ensemble, they no longer reach the chemistry and the best result of The Bride Came C.O.D.
