Few films have left me with such an uncomfortable feeling, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 million hateful and derived junk, the main impression is a bit like this other sick movie "Don't answer the phone" - but worse. The wickedness of all this, rape and all the rest, is shown without any distance (unlike strong things like "Last house on the left") and total disregard for the (perfect?) Victims and all those involved, leaving that the viewer is treated as a sadistic voyeur. In the end it seemed like taking a shower. No credit to the director
