Time is precious. This film is not. I have to learn to ignore the critics who excite about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: is this the movie that critics are excited about? What a piece of shit! <br /> <br /> The hook of this film is the upward moving black daughter who searches for and finds her family of white garbage. Get it? <br /> <br /> Acting is superb. <br /> <br /> Production (lighting, set, editing, sound) is about 2 steps over a 60-minute story. The characters are superficial and not very intelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not understand each other what was patently obvious to the public; the audience was muttering on the screen of the movie what the characters were supposed to say next. <br /> <br /> I had more fun doing laundry.
