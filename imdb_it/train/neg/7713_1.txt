I knew this movie had to be so bad that it was fun, so I went with that expectation. I just found out that it's so terrible that it was deadly boring. The whily song is fun for about 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing intelligent apart from its intentionally irritating quality. Seeing things splashing with tomatoes ages in about 30 seconds. There is nothing smart or funny in the film except for the premise. It could support a 3-4 minute comic sketch, but this is not a film based on any kind of imagination.
