It is interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented, the main characters were all a bit superficial and you didn't care about any of them. <br /> <br /> Rather insipid (and sometimes very bad) the photo leaves something to be desired but I imagine that you can't expect much from people who are making a low budget movie for the sake of it. It is not right to review the film and compare it with other high-budget films. But alas, this is what must be done. In itself, it is not very good. And compared to others, it's still not very good. But it's not without its good points! I liked the plot. It was built quite well and tied up well at the end. Sometimes in really dark scenes, he managed to create a disturbing feeling too. <br /> <br /> However, in the end the film fails to amaze. The characters are practically non-existent and we don't care about any of them. Each of them could die, but it is possible to identify the last "survivor" from the beginning.
