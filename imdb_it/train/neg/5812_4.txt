"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who have been fighting for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system." When "Politics" was filmed, the nineteenth amendment, which guarantees women the right to vote, was only ten years old. And, the film deals with the exercise of political power by women as a voting group. Promoting prohibition and closing speakeasies was a major concern for women at the time. <br /> <br /> The good-natured Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is killed and killed by a speakeasy. He wants the liquor sales joints closed; and, is drawn up in a Mayoral race, after having delivered a powerful speech at a female demonstration. Mrs. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (like Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (like Peter Higgins). The Dressler race for the mayor of Lake City attracts the opposition of the men in the city; thus, Dressler orders the women to strike, denying them, "all" in the "living room, in the bedroom and in the bathroom". <br /> <br /> The film sounds much better than it turns out. Humor, frankly, is not too good; and presents some humorous and moderately offensive situations ("You look Madame Queen" refers to a character from Amos and Andy). And, the mix of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well this time. The producers might have thought of making the film more dramatic, focusing exclusively on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (like Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7/25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
