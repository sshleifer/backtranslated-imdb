Take your basic Frankenstein movie, insert a Reanimator (but not the best parts) and you have Dr. Hackenstein. Of course, this was obviously inspired by the films mentioned above, but it never materializes as something special on its own. <br /> <br /> A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place overnight while trying to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to cut off parts of the body of some women who have run aground and, coincidentally, decides to stay the night at his house. <br /> <br /> I can't really say that acting is bad, nor is it directing. Everything here is simply too standard. Small attempts at humor really work (check the scene in which Hackenstein hides behind his deaf assistant because he would undoubtedly be very upset if he saw him holding a woman and a needle), but this is not enough to recommend this film. The music is decent, the blood is decent and the cast looks pretty good. And for half the time, I was even entertained by this movie. But I never thought that this was anything more than a waste of time. Avoidable. <br /> <br /> Try Frankenhooker instead.
