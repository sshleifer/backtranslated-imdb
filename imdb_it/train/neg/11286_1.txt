Where do you start with such a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Did you mention the cast of unlikely heroes? Exaggerated acting? The terrible script? <br /> <br /> No. You just say that anyone who pays money to watch such a poor movie needs to watch. I know I do it. I respect those poor boys who have seen it with little or no word in advance from mag like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for quality movie magazines). However, cinemas should really start thinking about granting refunds if the customer is not happy with the finished product. <br /> <br /> I went three days after opening with two other friends. The only other person in the cinema was a single person. <br /> <br /> And that was in the economic night. <br /> <br /> Either the advertising campaign had failed unpleasantly or the word had spread to the country of what is only a stinker. <br /> <br /> Since the days of The Avengers (1998) I have felt so little changed since watching a movie. If in a couple of months a companion arrives with this in video, make sure that you pay the electric bill while you watch it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a prize for not breaking out - or leaving the set; Keith Allen maintains a certain dignity in the midst of cinematographic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does not favor his career after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway as a secretary with big breasts. <br /> <br /> Please, considering it was in The Word, the expectations of viewers about its acting ability had to be quite low to begin with. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are not bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. If you want to hear a group of unlikely characters say "Fak!" for a couple of hours, this should be your way. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, barges are required. <br /> <br />
