In what seemed like the longest 1 hour and 35 I had to endure long, Al Pacino offers accurate performance to be sure. It's not his usual typecasting, which was nice. But his character was really pathetic. Someone to commit, while stumbling, forgetting the appointments while we realize that Hollywood's social life has drained him of his vital energy. But in this film we needed someone to like it. And for some reason, each character in the picture said "I don't know why I like you, Eli" for the character of Al Pacino and I couldn't even get close to him. <br /> <br /> All the characters other actors have played their usual styles. Tea Leoni, Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personality on TV or in previous films. And Kim Basinger wasn't even long enough in the film to offer a performance of any kind. <br /> <br /> The film's story had no momentum. Most of the scenes never carried the story forward, but rather simply collecting factoids on the characters that later came into play in an anti-clastic ending. He had potential except for their reluctance to rely on history. <br /> <br /> What is the point of the film? Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz will make you believe "Once Hollywood has you, you can't go out". Yeah, for sure! And that's why so many people are fired in Hollywood.
