DO NOT WATCH THIS EXPIRED FOR A FILM. I've wasted time and money on this and I'm pretty crazy about it. <br /> <br /> Acting is comparable to school plays. The script is shocking. There is no plot. Twenty minutes from the end (which I think I should be rewarded for having achieved) I had a headache from all the screaming, crying and wailing of the five girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the violence is (rare for a movie nowadays) suggested rather than graphically represented, but I found the characters so damn irritating that I wanted to see them, and indeed every single person involved in making this piece of s ** t, die as horribly as possible. <br /> <br /> I will spend another ten minutes of my life saving you from a very poor 100 minutes. Do not do it
