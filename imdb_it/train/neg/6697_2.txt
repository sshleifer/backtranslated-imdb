Crazed Shotgun toting-revenge-seeking incest seeks truck drivers and obsessive control disorder "daddy raped me when I was 12" carrying handcuffs, all latex-wearing prostitutes are just some of the characters you will be introduced to in this complete misfortune of a film that can be easily viewed on any cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4:00 on a Sunday evening. (?? And yes, I know it was a whole sentence, but naked with me people, this is a lengthy review for a short, useless film). <br /> <br /> shot in "somewhere" in Canada, with almost no budget, the plot of this strange show is trivial, the police obviously never heard of "state jurisdiction" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers) that Trent (idiot, reticent anal, generic, insecure university student) throughout the United States (and I thought only the FBI could do it). The camera is flickering, the sex scenes are mediocre and the acting is so bad that it could actually inadvertently cause acid flashbacks to films like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As for the Skin go scenes (which is the only reason to rent this film too, don't even think about buying it) there are two. The first is the only one worth watching, which is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actor here, of course he has done nothing but worth noting) in a depressing motel room (the kind with the broken sink dripping, and the soda machine outside which contains only blue tonic water). It's all S & M (riding, handcuffs, waxing and underwear licking) and he is eventually left in a motel room, with no money and cops waiting at his door (this is to show you guys, don't let him leave a prostitute you tie yourself in a "motel room" in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin that deserves to be remembered, and this alone can cause profound traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so this is definitely a negative aspect for this film. <br /> <br /> As for the ending, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably wouldn't mind if I revealed it to you but I won't, you should spend your hard-earned money for that. All in all, I give him a 1/5 for the action, a 3/5 for Skin (see the last paragraph) and a 0/0 for acting, character development or intricate twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
