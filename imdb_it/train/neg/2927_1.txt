Somewhere out there, there must be a list of all the worst gay movies of all time made. One of those who have excessively photographed the stars that sit and watch thoughtfully in space, or where they focus intolerably for a long time on the kittens that eat spaghetti. This motion sickness image is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in the caves and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk, walk, swim, have sex and make themselves drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then comes out and there is a lot of fast forwarding and rewinding and there are long pensive shots of one of them looking into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I think it's a sort of extravagant film production technique or maybe the fact that the film is so serious that it has to be filled with long and useless shots, because otherwise if they had to rely on plot or story the film would be about 14 minutes. Don't get me wrong, this is the 30th gay movie I've seen in the last 6 months and some of them (many of them) have been very formulated, predictable and boring, but this is really a terrible waste of The best so far has been "Beautiful Thing ". So, I looked at this and after the very first opening stroke that lingered and lingered I thought "Oh, no, it will be creative sinny mah" But I gave it a chance and watched it and then when it was finished I threw the DVD into trash can. Sorry I didn't like it and if you did, sorry if I'm offended.
