* Contains some spoilers * This movie is a horrible 80s style in all its terribleness. The plot takes too long to take off, it never holds up, and then it simply crashes for about 40 minutes into the film. There are some precious moments for zombie fans, but not enough zombies to create a real sense of terror. <br /> <br /> Even zombies take a long time to make their appearance. First, there is an entire half of a movie about mobs and bands of prisoners. The hero of the film is a former Vietnam veteran who gets involved in the crowd. The main mafia boss picks him up and he goes to prison. In this prison, they are experimenting with prisoners to find a way to cure them of murderous tendencies and criminal behavior. But the chief psychologist / scientist badie has other plans in mind. He wants to use a slightly different version of the serum to make .... from da da ... super soldiers! After some infected prisoners have killed some guards and most of the prison has a communion-infected wine tour, the military / mad scientist says "hey this could be a problem" and calls the genius scientist hot investigative journalist ultra independent female character, who naturally invented the original serum. He goes to prison to see what is happening, the military calls some SWAT teams from his safe position out of prison, and the hero takes charge of the few prisoners with a heart of gold when a revolt breaks out. The hero and the scientist / journalist come together to find a cure, save the director's children and take care of some angry prisoners, both infected and not. Meanwhile, the mob boss made a deal to enter the prison so he could save his imprisoned brother. The military is preparing to blow up the place, and everyone inside is quick to find a way out. <br /> <br /> There are many bloody scenes in which people are killed by pressure or thrown through prison bars. There is also a creepy beheading scene and electrocution scene involving the infected Rasta prisoner himself. However, the most disturbing scene is in the first part of the film, when a big corrupt guard rapes a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film is a scene towards the end. The hero, the woman and the children are trying to reach the only escape route. Their path leads them to a long corridor, on one side there is a wall and on the other there are the prison bars. Hundreds of bloody zombie hands stretch out between them, embellishing their hair and their faces as they pass. There are also some good scenes from the classic "couple of zombies chewing on newly dead bodies" and "many zombies tearing apart pieces". <br /> <br /> Overall, it is worth looking at if you are researching the genus zombie as it has many noteworthy zombie clich√©s; it is practically an instruction manual on what not to do when making a zombie movie. But if you're new to zombie movies and you want a real scare, you should look elsewhere.
