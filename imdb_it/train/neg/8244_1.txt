I think this movie should have been shocking. But the only way it's really shocking is how shocking it has been ... and it simply is. It's an hour and a half of torment. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the film (the five girls). Surely the main characters take their bloody piece in a wrong way, which is basically good, since it's a horror- movie. And I (usually) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in this type of film per se. However, all the violence in this film is of no use. It is not a different show than the one that is simply grotesque. It's so lousy that it gets boring, and also very fast. <br /> <br /> The worst thing (if the above is not bad enough for you) on this film is that they tried to copy Blair Whitch Project, filming with cheap hand-held cameras. But (again) it serves no purpose. In the "Blair Which", quite sure, there is an explanation, that is they are with a camera in search of the blair witch. In this film, there is no other explanation than, "Hey, we want this to LOOK LIKE Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the film is also something to be depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many times you can't understand what they're saying. Furthermore, no effort has been made to make anything better, healthy from the point of view or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is the soundtrack, which is as bad as the rest, and varies from low cost home to the worst ramshackle hard rock ... <br /> <br /> The my advice: don't look at it under any circumstances.
