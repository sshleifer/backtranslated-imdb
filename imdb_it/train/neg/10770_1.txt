It could contain possible spoilers (not that nothing in this film is new or even slightly surprises you) <br /> <br /> Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything it has ever done on the back burner? Sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, you wouldn't think that the general quality and the way people think of them would stop. House Of Villains is a despicable exhibition of cartoon crossovers that makes absolutely no sense. Some signs of total disregard for the previous films in this are: The voices do not even remotely fit and Iago is evil again (Since when?!) I know these films are aimed at children but there was a time when everyone could have fun with Disney movies. Even the musical number of the film (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stank. I would not recommend this film to anyone, not even the youngest. All I can do is that if more of these films of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before a small animation studio overcomes the overall quality of Disney.
