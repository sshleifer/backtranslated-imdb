He was one of those late at night "It's there", I saw things. Sometimes they are fantastic. This was horrible, but really it shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> The film had a really good cast. How can you fail when you have Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We are talking about the Oscar-winning carpet here. It had good special effects. She also had really good tits! And I mean well shown, full breast with full nipple and at some point even some beaver. But it has not compensated for the only missing ingredient: a story! The plot was ridiculous. I don't mean the sun "sun burst" that explodes, but it was bad enough. It was the rest of the stuff - the stuff of evil society so stupid and totally predictable. Man that STANK! No amount of good acting or fantastic spaceships or fight scenes could get around that. <br /> <br /> I saw the same cast members being incredibly good. I saw wonderful science fiction films that had tiny casts and budgets. All the difference is in writing.
