I've seen Gator Bait's movies, and that's almost exactly the same as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically demands her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that distinguishes this film from those (though not very distant) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is all the frontal nudity many times during the film, but not for a second it is never sexy. Some rape scenes might seem a bit extended, but it's only because the film is trying to reinforce the need of the public to see this woman seeking revenge. <br /> <br /> This is a weak film, it has nothing else to maintain interest besides manipulating our natural desire to see this woman take revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of film you expect to offer a serious morality, but I was pleased to see that since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted on the female protagonist, it was not destined to faint like a movie T & A. <br /> <br /> Movies B are famous for being guided by nudity and uncontrollable adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, nudity does not guide the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty need for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like in the films of Gator Bait, and the biggest challenge for writers seems to have been to invent new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason why the film can never be anything more compared to a nonsensical B-movie it is because it does not transmit a message of any kind, but instead simply satisfies the desire of the public to see a group of rapists get exactly what they deserve. <br /> <br /> The only problem this leaves is that we have to sit through sexual attacks. Strangely, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (though not much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are also a little disappointed when we look at revenge since a couple of deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems pure luck that the boy in the lake eventually felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the engine on the boat and press the his genitals against the propeller, remaining so while the woman screams some final words against him and pulls the rope), but once again, this film only satisfies the desire for revenge that the first time has filled us. <br /> <br /> (spoiler) You know this is all the film means to do, since it literally ends the moment the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily forever, she does not write her book, she does not go away and never returns to that nightmare place, she gets into the boat and goes around the lake while the film simply stops abruptly. But hey, what else did you expect? <br /> <br /> Oh, and did you read the slogan? If you decide to waste time looking at this, try to find someone who breaks or burns. I really didn't look forward to those ??
