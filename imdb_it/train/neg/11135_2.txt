What else can I say? The acting was, almost without exception, amateur. Direction and continuity were painful. The sceenplay was predictable until the last scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the features of the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel", but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the funniest things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said, with a straight face, that he had decided to make a film with high production values ​​and a cast of names - and that he had succeeded. With delusions like these, it's easy to see how the film ended up. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. Darkwolf's suit was a modified monkey suit (for the 'making of' feature on the DVD) and rather looked at it. The mask and claws were slightly better than those of any costume shop. The CGI effects were painfully obvious and of similar quality to an economic video game.
