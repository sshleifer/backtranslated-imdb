I don't know who had the idea that orcas go around killing people and hitting and destroying things for revenge, but my god is absurd. Killer whales are certainly not the cold-blooded killer that this film brings out to be ... it's silly. Killer whales are extremely intelligent, don't get me wrong, but I strongly doubt that they know and understand a concept like revenge. So I have to say that all I got from this movie was the entertainment of how absurd it was. So I was at least a little amused by that. Personally, I would recommend going to see Jaws if you want to see a kind of Animal-Killing-Humans movie. But if you're like me and you want to laugh at something so far from realism, then I'd say go ahead. : D
