This movie explodes: let's go right away. There are some stage gems embedded in this pile of shit but none can redeem the plot to limp. Colin Farrel resembles Brad Pitt in "12 Monkeys" and acts similarly. I normally hate Colin because he's a fairy in general, but he's OK in this movie. There were two plot lines in this film: one about a child throwing rocks through the windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a mustache. Let's face it: this film has no crazy idea of ​​what it meant or where it wanted to go. The narrative lines of the characters intertwine on some levels but are not worthy of being included in a script. Everything is weak and useless and then there is an occasional OK scene. But overall, don't worry if you don't like Irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and are saved by all those who sound like the Lucky Charms elf, an American fetish who has catapulted some really lousy movies to success.
