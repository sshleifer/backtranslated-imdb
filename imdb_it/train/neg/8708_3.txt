Like all Carnosaur films, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move, reminds me of when my sister plays with her dolls, because they can't be stiffer or more fake than they were. <br /> <br /> The plot made absolutely no sense. I mean, first I'm on a bus, then in a warehouse, then suddenly I'm in a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can be together in a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals and now they can stay on a moving van. It sounds silly even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 3 is because it's still fun. I found it better than the first (I haven't looked at the second one yet). Just don't rent it. I saw it on TV and it's a good thing I did because I didn't want to waste money on it.
