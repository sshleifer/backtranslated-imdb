The plot is plausible but banal, that is the beautiful and neglected wife of a rich and powerful man has an adventure with a psychotic piece, then tries to cover it up like the psychopath and covers it. But what develops from there is incredibly illogical. Despite the resources available for the usual couple who have money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine seem to have only one servant, their lawyer and the local police (who say they can't do anything) at their disposal as they struggle with suspense and terror. They do not have private security personnel (only a fancy security system that they mistreat), family or land personnel, drivers, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private nurses 24 hours a day to take care of the hero when he suffers fatal injuries, leaving the man and wife alone and vulnerable in their villa. Our heroine is portrayed as having the handle of a brain and our hero, a magnate, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational way. Production is an insult to viewers who have wasted their time with this braggart and a crime for wasting the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for offending the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offer.
