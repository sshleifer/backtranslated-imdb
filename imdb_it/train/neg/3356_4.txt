Shirley Jackson's novel "The Haunting of Hill House" is a striking story of terror, which transmits supernatural phenomena in an old villa. The atmosphere is well set and the chills are well performed. A haunting masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The 1963 chiller 'The Haunting' remains closely related to the book, but also adds its details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are performed even better on the screen. Black and white photography does nothing but increase the creepiness of the film. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then, Jan de Bont did this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit cinemas - if you could call it a remake. Because they had to do a remake of the 1963 film is a mystery in itself, but for now, let's look at the film itself. <br /> <br /> Start on average, like many horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and strangely mysterious, and for a few minutes it seems that the film is actually a beautiful story. And then, the first fright arrives: a loose harpsichord thread cuts the face of a woman (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is fun and, to be honest, it almost made me cry. <br /> <br /> From then on, the film moves only downwards. The acting seems to become rather wooden while the film goes on, with Owen Wilson's character particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he is beheaded by the chimney). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this movie pretty much, which is a real shame, because most of them are incredibly shoddy and very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother to list them. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend looking at the original cooler, or, as an alternative, buying Shirley Jackson's novel. But please stay away from this. And if you decide to watch it, watch it on TV (since many channels like to watch this movie, and not the original) or rent it cheaply, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final grade: 4/10
