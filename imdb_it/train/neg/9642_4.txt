I couldn't believe that the horrible dialogue came out of people's mouths, and the fine reel of bloopers attached to the body of the film was a hoot. And we get titanic shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (sort of) and Loren Crabtree to boot. <br /> <br /> A psychic transporter device activated by the psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground desert laboratory. According to director Fred Olen Ray, these were advanced sets from Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film more value than it's cheap. <br /> <br /> Inside the container there is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) who starts to scratch people to death. It was pretty fun to watch this little "creature" in a black reptile dress with what looks like a big cockroach attached to it, running in the dark. We also saw the small stamp on an ET poster, which I thought was hilarious. <br /> <br /> And then there is what looks like a snake coming out of the container that is hammered into death by William Fair, after the mini creature chews Frank McDonald's neck in the kitchen. A low budget for ALIEN, I suppose ... <br /> <br /> The whole thing stops abruptly, seeming to have finished the film at the end before the blooper reel enters with the credits. Speaking of a lack of funds ... <br /> <br /> Even Fred Olen Ray mentions in the director's comment that they too weren't sure if Aldo Ray would shoot and remember his lines. He just did. <br /> <br /> Low-cost cheese sneeze. It's fun to watch, I guarantee you. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
