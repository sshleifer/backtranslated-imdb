It wasn't good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality came from the memories I had of the previous film that contrasted with the "new" personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously thought that the opening scene was an Ariel nightmare because of how absurd it was. It was serious. He just reminded me of all the annoying characters from the Disney channel: everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any connection. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part was the horrible songs, not catchy, not surprising. In the original Ariel had an incredible and powerful voice and the whole song is catchy and fun. You remember them and you want to sing them. But the songs in this film were not at all creative; it's as if they were talking to a boring, rather weak, disappointing voice. I don't have the kind of desire to sing that you normally get from a Disney movie. <br /> <br /> It's like nobody wants to make this movie, so they barely made an effort. . . this film would need a new plot, catchy new songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying "look at me! look at me! I'm so annoying!" mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
