Bugs Bunny accidentally ends up in the South Pole trying to go on vacation to Florida. Where he meets a small penquin, who tries to save from an Eskimo. This brief attempt and the penqu√≠n are adorable, but in the end it is a bit too light in the laughter department. The Eskimo is not really a great talent for Bugs and I saw much better Bugs Bunny cartoons, also other short films when it is paired with other unknown antagonists. So I cannot conscientiously recommend this. However it is nice to see it in its uncut shape. This comic is on disc 3 of the "Volume of Looney Tunes Volume 1" <br /> <br /> My Grade: C
