I couldn't wait to see this movie because it looked really promising from upcoming attractions: Jim Carrey with divine powers was an idea that surely worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure that he would be immensely in his element with such a promising premise, and what could go wrong? Yesterday, my bubble exploded big, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it is set that he hates his life, is a disgruntled employee and a severely unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God) is useful, the second act (where he is called by God by phone and receives Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey has fun with her new 'toys' and it is a pleasure to watch it, really funny. But the third act is unhappy beyond imagination. <br /> <br /> The rot begins to set after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who shows EXCEPTIONALLY good in this film considering that his part is simply a plot device, also her NAME stinks of emptiness - she thinks she'll ask the question but instead tells her (on her knees again) that she's finally getting her anchor job, and it's not that exciting? <br /> <br /> You don't think so. She wants him to marry her, you see, so she ends up leaving him, you see, even though she still loves him a lot, see, and the rest of the film has gone on beating us over the head with a pathetic, over-heavy-past-sounding clich√© spiritual after the next, I also prayed to the end. . .to be finished. <br /> <br /> I didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (an example - in the 2nd act, after getting his powers, Bruce goes up to the room singing "And if God were one of us, just a crap like one of us, "blah blah blah), and I was even willing to overlook the incredible amount of contradictions that were thrown at us (for the opener, Morgan Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce that he can't violate no one's free will, but it does, a lot). Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac - it's not The Remains of the Day. <br /> <br /> Or rather it was SUPPORT to be a comedy. When the writers lose track of this (in the dreaded act 3) and try to transform the procedure into a sort of movie of the message (gag), what we get is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, realizes that GRACE is his salvation - I must say - grace, and that his priorities in life have been severely misunderstood. However, all this could have been transmitted in a much less heavy way. The film didn't have to go to the trap to make these points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to solve the story in a clever and light way, so they put themselves on the "bang-over-the-head" trajectory in the hope that we wouldn't notice. They also attached some surprisingly surprising surprises in the end, in the further hope that this would reduce the bad taste. It didn't work for me.
