This is a really stupid movie. It might be fun with aliens and the country environment, but it's not. <br /> <br /> Some aliens listen to the War of the Worlds broadcast when playing a small country radio station on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people slaves and behave foolishly. The film's cover shows these aliens riding surfboards in space ... not quite what they do. These are not party aliens, they are stupid cartoon idiots with annoying modulated annoying voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be Jack Nicholson's robber stranger who always wears sunglasses. Apart from the aliens, acting is terrible. Writing is obviously meant for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a stupid film, which only children will appreciate, perhaps. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 on ****. 100 minutes PG for a delicate language.
