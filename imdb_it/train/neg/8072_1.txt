(A possible spoiler or two) <br /> <br /> "Soul Survivors" is probably the worst movie ever released in theaters. Nothing makes sense, there is some story about a girl who has strange visions of people who may or may not be dead. The whole film is just a bunch of random shots of things that don't really bind at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is non-existent, the camera work is jerky and the script is so confusing, it just makes the movie even more difficult to watch. <br /> <br /> I kept waiting for something to tie the film together but nothing came. Definitely the worst movie of the year. - **** 1/2 stars.
