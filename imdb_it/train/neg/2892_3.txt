Ursula Andress's naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) also have beautiful bodies. So why is the highest grade I can give a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, to reach Ursula's incredible body, we have to go through a film that is otherwise not very funny and boring (keep in mind that I saw the full 101 minute version, not the 78 minute American version that probably cuts a lot of the foreign material). In the typical Italian comic tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army maniac, the "Latin lover", the constant drunk, the naive waitress) who are not funny, simply overcrowded. Last word: look at this, but keep your finger on the fast forward button, you'll need it. (*)
