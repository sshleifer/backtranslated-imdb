You know you're in trouble when the movie you're watching has numerous alternative titles. Generally it means that they have tried and tried to hide the turkey in various markets. That turkey is The Brain Machine which has seven different titles. <br /> <br /> It is a super secret government project that supposes being able to use a computer to read people, but instead pushes people to kill each other or themselves, or something. It is full of B-level TV actors sitting in a paneled room with garden chairs trying to recite a script that makes almost no sense. <br /> <br /> It is a turkey of greasy type. Avoid it.
