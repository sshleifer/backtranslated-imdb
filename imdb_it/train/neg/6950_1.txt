We all knew it even before it was broadcast, Ron Moore's miniseries is not Battlestar Galactica. All right. It just means that it has to stand on its own. He cannot rely on Battlestar Galactica. If it's okay, it's fine for his merits, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If the reports are true, this is what Moore wanted. However, if his miniseries rots, he shamed all the excellent actors who performed on the screen, not to mention the myriad of people off screen. And that's what he did. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini series is not a remake. I wouldn't even call it re-imagining. It's a new production, inspired by Battlestar Galactica. It does not take place in the Galactica universe, with the same places, jargon and technology. It does not tell Galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe. Nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that supported Galactica. Ron Moore's miniseries is a space opera, an action movie with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Maybe I should say, "just another" space opera, action movie. Because as a plot, his has little that is original, or even interesting. I could forward you all without a spoiler warning. But I won't inflict it on you. I'll just hit the most important point. Ready now? Here it is: just watch the trailer. He will tell you everything in history. <br /> <br /> Yes, man's creations appeal to man and seek to destroy man. (I guess they forgot Azimov's rules again.) They look human, so there's the whole alien thing between us. At least there is no time travel. Oh, and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence. The end result was that when Moore drew from Galactica, that ceremonial nod, it came out more banal than respectful. I mean, couldn't he even think of something of his own? <br /> <br /> From the first few minutes, I wanted to look at something else. I didn't care about any of Moore's characters, since I couldn't identify with any of them. This struck me in the face when the Cylons began their attack. Armageddon on a planetary scale, and I don't care. How depressing. Moore's heroes faced an insurmountable obstacle, instead of overcoming it, they put their tails in a safe place and saved their butts. After all, it was the only way to save humanity, yadda yadda yadda. They took the safe exit, rather than risk their lives to defend others. At least the disgust is not apathy. <br /> <br /> But in the end, Ron Moore's mini series was just a pointless activity, a film on a treadmill, which always ran without going anywhere. And I just wanted it to end. And when it was all over, my life force was sucked into me. Against my own will, I was turning into a mindless, soulless zombie, probably the kind this miniseries liked. I needed to rebuild myself. I needed - and I swear it's true - I needed to watch an episode of Babylon 5. Two episodes, in fact, and I felt much better. And happier.
