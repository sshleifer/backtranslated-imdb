I think Jason Lee has enormous potential, but this was the WRONG vehicle in which to try to burst like a star. The plot is terrible, the play is terrible. I laughed twice, I think of relief, because in retrospect, they were rather lame jokes. I found myself afraid of Fletch's future, and I had to console myself that it was the film that was defective, not Lee. <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles and Selma Blair are hot, but I recommend looking at more photos on this site to understand, instead of this movie. Save 1 star time.
