I couldn't wait to get the DVD after hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! This has become one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. Many characters have been introduced, some similar to others, that it has become impossible to follow the plot. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was barely involved, at least in the first half of the film. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of suffering and interrupted the DVD. I could have considered the quick forwarding to see if the ending was better, but after much confusion I decided that the chances for improvement were poor. A colleague told me that much of the film "meets" in the last minute or less. I was glad I hadn't lost another hour, waiting. I gave away the DVD the following day.
