I can't say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But again, I can't say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> OK, so basically a girl skating, she's good, she wants to go to an expensive school, she can't afford it and she has to take a hockey scholarship. He must hide his skating secret from his friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I didn't like the actress who plays Katelin. He could not possibly cry to save her life, he had only made plaintive sounds, like a child pretending to cry to get his way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just a boring person. The way he tried to behave in a kind and helpful way with people. Even the part where the two skaters call her names and say something about her choreographer and she says she "draws the line" made me shudder. <br /> <br /> We all knew where she would go with her and Spencer. Classically they never liked each other and in the end it was typical. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is a movie to watch if you like skating but if you don't mind the main skater is extremely annoying. It is good to kill time basically.
