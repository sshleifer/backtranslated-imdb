The premise of the film is spooky: a woman becomes pregnant when she is kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the film begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that it is a type of science fiction film type C. It's a great Star Trek and a bit of X-files, but more than anything it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the film starts, everything is predictable and clich√©. He looked more like a 2 parter in a bad science fiction TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but not for lack of attempts. Just a lot of predictable dramatic confrontations between the main characters. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time.
