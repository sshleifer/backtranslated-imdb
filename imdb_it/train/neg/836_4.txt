A passionate fan of TLK films, with the first one representing a milestone and the second probably the best sequel that Disney has produced, along with this film ... Now I'm not discussing with animation, vocal work, the music, but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Even if it's not bad, it adds nothing. Basically this movie is a big joke ... and that's all that saves it. Create a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
