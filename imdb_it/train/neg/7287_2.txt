<br /> <br /> In his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbade him. Many decades later, the old man raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allowed his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, her sister is bored by her brother number 1 and jumps onto her brother's bed # 2. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three brothers are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are higher-level Europeans who go to college and are engaged in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirtatious moment between an unrelated woman and the two brothers. We never see any flirtatious moment between an unrelated male and the other sister. All moments of coquetry are shared only between brothers and sisters. <br /> <br /> The weakest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have had hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls about him, but no - he just wanted his sister? If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (slowly) excite you endlessly.
