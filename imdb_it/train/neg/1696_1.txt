I hate to throw out lines like this, but in this case I feel like I have to do it: the American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters in the last 5 years. There, I said it. And now that I got it from my system, please let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in the grip of powerful anger, a curse is born. The curse builds up in that place of death, those who meet it will be consumed by its fury." This is the premise of THE GRUDGE and I admit that it seems intriguing. Unfortunately, filmmakers don't do it anymore. Those who encounter the "curse" are really consumed by his fury and that is all you get. Do you want more? Well, too bad Some critics and fans point out that THE GRUDGE's sole purpose is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to talk about, disturbing images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulling a George Sluizer and remaking his original film, bravely tries to create an atmosphere in the first hour ?? repeating the same scene over and over and over and over again. It takes place practically like this: <br /> <br /> - the person enters the house <br /> <br /> - something flashes at the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> - person goes to investigate <br /> <br /> - it starts to get noisy <br /> <br /> -person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> - the high scream and / or the squeal of cat <br /> <br /> -cut to black <br /> <br /> Before the public is even given a hint of plot, this same identical scenario takes place 5 times in the first hour. The first time was actually a bit creepy. Every subsequent use became ridiculous as the film went on. When the end of the film turned, my friend and I were laughing, wondering if this scene would end "with a loud scream and a cut to black". We have never been denied. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a cover storyline, but develops into a series of cartoons that leave the audience confused. I have no problem with non-linear narration when it's done right. The film jumps from a period of time to a period of time without any rhyme or reason. I have not seen a film in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this narrative technique marched all sorts of mysteries that the film could have had. If you already know that ghosts have scared two characters to death, how shocking is their body in the attic? And why should we worry when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> Obviously the greenlit second US version of THE RING grossed $ 15 million his first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but a calculated imitation disguised as a real movie. The most terrifying things about THE GRUDGE are that he earned $ 40 million on the first weekend and some people consider it the "scariest movie ever made". I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the fury of payment to see THE GRUDGE?
