The shame! Here I am, comfortable in the armchair with a beer and a bag of popcorn, bouyant in the hope of another wonderful night of Muppet entertainment. What did I get? Disappointed! How can the Muppets move from the sublime Christmas carol to this? The humor was terrible, the songs were worse than those of Country and Western (and this was saying something) and the plot was as confusing and poor as Blind Pew. I think the main problem is that they have stopped too much in trying the treasure island. A short story, like Christmas Carol, is perfect because you can weave around the Muppet brats ... here the need to drag the plot along has stopped all the fun. Where do the Muppets go after? What about Muppets Wizard of Oz?
