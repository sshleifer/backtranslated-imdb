Steve Carpenter can't make horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown-haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This film has no gore (usually a key ingredient for a horror film), no action, no acting and no suspense (even a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor, but he is so dry and simple in this that he is sad. There were some parts that were supposed to be fun (continuing the horror / comedy movies for kids) and nobody was laughing in the audience. I thought this movie was classified as R, and I didn't pay attention and realized that it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway, watch this movie if you liked it. I still know what you did last summer. This is the only kind of person who could find this movie even remotely scary. And seriously, this is Steve Carpenter for you, stop making horror movies. This film makes Scream Texas Chainsaw Massacre look like.
