I am at a distinct disadvantage here. I have not seen the first two films of this series, although I have seen many films by Larry Cohen. Fans of the series seem to think this is a good movie. Judging by itself, it was quite boring. <br /> <br /> You never had a real look at the face of the manic cop (Robert Z'Dar), but what I saw was rather sad. The scenes of death seem to be staged to eat the greatest number of films, so as not to give chills. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 Director's Cut, I could be more impressed. <br /> <br /> The ending with the car chase with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense. the best part of the film.
