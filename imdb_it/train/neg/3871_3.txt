I try to be very objective when viewing a low budget movie. I also apply less weight to independent, low-budget productions than big-budget productions. I expect almost flawless from big budget productions and their studies. Therefore I apply stricter criteria to the main study versions. But this film was just a real disaster. Period. The premise was terrible. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a high school student with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or in his acting that brought you into his world. Furthermore, to make this film more mysterious, the lighting in some scenes did not create the atmosphere, especially in the warehouse. <br /> <br /> Once again another disappointing film to which I could only give three points.
