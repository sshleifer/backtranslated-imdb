The United States seems to run the United Kingdom police, all of which are armed to the teeth and you know that CID agents change in uniform when they stop working and go down to the pub! This must be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of the "real" UK police ever to be clouded by the unsuspecting public. I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax, but what the hell was good actor like Charles Dance in it is a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst low budget "B" movie of the 50s. An hour and a half of suicide and time will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as the real plague.
