Once again, Canadian TV exceeds itself and creates another show that will remain unattended after its main episode. <br /> <br /> The last time I remember that the sitcoms had to induce a reaction in the laughter called by the business. How much fun is it to beat the stereotype of all whites thinking that all Muslims are terrorists? OK maybe a joke just to stick it to the masses. But not 30 minutes. It's called beating a dead horse. Even SNL could give up after an advertising break. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, we make a small conflict in these scripts. Will she or won't she be able to serve cucumber sandwiches to break the Ramadan fast? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh this is Emmy's win here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! What characters? They are all cardboard cut-outs without anything interesting to make us want to follow them from one situation to another. This is the point of the comedy situation. We need strong, interesting and dynamic characters, to be constantly attracted to the TV every week. We need to worry about these characters to worry about what problems will come next week. If I never see these characters it will be too soon. Fortunately I can't remember any of their names (note to CBC - it's not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the acting is so insignificant. It is more a problem in the cast than in the actors. None of these people actually embodies the characters he plays. They just seem to play their part as if they were working on a movie of the week. Sitcoms require actors who live and breathe that character - they make us fall in love with them - where they become inseparable from the character they portray. Watch any American sitcom and see how easily the characters are identifiable. Part of the problem is that the actors seem to treat this project as if it could be a platform for bigger and better things instead of being their only great character in a life for which they will spend the next 8 years. That level of disinterest in the characters and in the project shows. But to be honest, considering the lame concept and the horrible writing, there is not much to do for the actors, but to play their lines and try not to come across any furniture. As another commentator mentions, this looks like a TV movie and not a sitcom. <br /> <br /> And the direction or the lack of! What can I say, Canada has so much talent, look at what Comedy Channel is doing with Puppets Who Kill and Punched Up. Watch the Trailer Park Boys (it's not the movie because it bitten the big helium dog). Watch any American show to see the potential of our talent as many of our stars go to find a decent job. <br /> <br /> Give credit to CBC, they really know how to build advertising for a non-event. Remember "The One"? No, well, don't even try to learn the names of the characters on this show, because it will surely end the dodo. <br /> <br /> We all hope it is a full-blown ACTRA shot so that nothing like this emerges from the Ceeb for quite some time.
