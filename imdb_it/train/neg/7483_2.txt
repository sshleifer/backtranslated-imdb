One might think (as I did), that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a film should at least be decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the most entertaining comedy works of all time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently I was grossly mistaken - this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It drives me crazy the way one joke after another can be so deeply unpleasant. It hurt to see these talented actors perform one of the blandest scripts I've had the misfortune to meet. Based solely on the big names, I was long hopeful for the duration of the film, but constantly failed to provide any entertainment. <br /> <br /> Normally, both in movies and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this film it's hard not to let it go. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, the main Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this --- I really did. But The Out-of-Towners fails miserably. If you really want to have a little fun, take your money and watch it as it turns while you unload the toilet. Please don't watch this movie.
