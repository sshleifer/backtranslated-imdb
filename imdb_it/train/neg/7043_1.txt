I was ready to laugh for the whole film as an experiment in the Mystery Science Theater, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many passionate biker friends, and from there they accidentally decided to make a movie. <br /> <br /> It is often unwatchable. Lots of footage of bikers on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is barely in the movie. Harmon would probably have revived things. Perhaps he had other commitments the day he was shot. <br /> <br /> Of course, motorcyclists terrorize a small town. Struggles, murders, cowardly cops, silly mechanics, etc. One of the bikers always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish it from all other outlaws. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. A scene presents a motorcyclist attacking a woman, screaming at the lady "You are all the same! You are all the same!". Let's go back to the scene a minute later and he again declares "You're all the same!". Could the writer not think of something more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end the good guys killed the bad guys. We also discover that the marriage between the middle-aged mechanic Joe and the young Susie has been canceled. Susie is going to college and suddenly we learn that Joe's marriage is still active (but with a different bride). End.
