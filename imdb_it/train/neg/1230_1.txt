Words cannot describe how absolutely stupid this story is (and therefore ugly this movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what were you thinking? So there is a shopping center and its parking lot is completely full. Basinger's character goes to buy a cup of tea and wrapping paper. <br /> <br /> When it comes out, the whole place is so empty, that nobody hears two shots fired in the vicinity ?? Even if she lives there, when she walks away from the bad guys, does she go to the most remote and forgotten place of God instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place ?? COME ON !!! I won't even go into the infamous red toolbox, since other people have already done it. Not to mention how he kills moral thugs one after another. <br /> <br /> It's so stupid, without the slightest logic, I can only warn you while you look at it, it's a total waste of time, honestly !!
