A difficult-to-find film that skirts Senator Joe McCarthy's still-pervasive mythology as king of political demons. Boyle (like Joe) gives a convincing but historically inaccurate portrait of the Wisconsin senator, the caricature of McCarthy many consider it the real one. Meredith, like the astute lawyer Joseph Welch, who outsmarted McCarthy at the 1954 army auditions, is very good, as always. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohn were right to worry about the frightening security situation in the army, and the 1954 army audiences got caught up in the smokescreen used by the army to divert investigations from their security failures, which the committee was investigating, counterbalancing the fact that McCarthy and Cohn were trying to get favors for their staffer, David Schine, while on duty. <br /> <br /> The film is a polemic driven by the agenda, self-sufficient, based on the widespread myths that have actually passed with many people for decades - that the "red fear" was essentially fake and McCarthy, HUAC etc. . they always fired at wrong targets, being nothing but a lie, the career ruined the hounds of advertising, which trampled on the constitutional rights of innocent liberals surprised, who had been accused of being a security risk / com munists. <br /> <br /> People who know little about the issue still feel confident in repeating misinformation about McCarthy and the "red fear" to date - Clooney's Murrow hagiography is an example. Disinformation is pervasive, no wonder people have swallowed it. A recent objection by Budd Schulberg in the serious British left-wing newspaper "The Guardian" was the headline for the Hollywood writer "named name" "to McCarthy" - perpetuating the lie that McCarthy "investigated" Hollywood as head of HUAC - the truth is that McCarthy doesn't he was never even a member of the HUAC and had little interest in Hollywood type politics - his investigations were limited almost exclusively to US government weapons. <br /> <br /> The "red scare" mythology was unfounded now it has completely exploded from the documents of the Soviet government and the recently opened United States, if ever McCarthy and co have underestimated the scale of the infiltration of the Soviets and comrades travel in the United States, but decades of public disinformation over this period will be difficult to correct. <br /> <br /> Someday maybe a really brave Hollywood soul will make a film that tells the truth about how many American men and women have clandestinely helped the mass murderer Stalin, and worked to impose his vicious system of rulers on the Western world, perhaps giving an accurate account of Joe McCarthy's career - but I do not hold my breath. Until then, we have this mythical and drunk liar rascal of popular imagination so familiar in the media ... "Tail gunner Joe".
