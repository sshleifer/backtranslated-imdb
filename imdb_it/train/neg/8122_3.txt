Painful to watch, and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters. Two of the main characters, Cynthia the mother and Monica the recognized daughter, spend most of the film pathetically meowing and complaining bitterly respectively. Their characters are so firmly established that their redemption in tolerable personalities after a rapid family catharsis is incredible. It was not worth the wait. I hope that a step worthy of honesty among families is less of a headache to see.
