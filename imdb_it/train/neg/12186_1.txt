This remake of the original 1962 movie has some very good parts to recommend and some good performances by some good actors - however Scorsese opts towards the end for the most formidable plot of twists and an embarrassed Shakespearean confusion that DeNiro made me superb actor, dedicated to giving all of himself in the work he does, yet he needs a direction to focus his talent, and this is seriously lacking in the last five minutes of the film. <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's cameo is useful but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with a few lines like this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte turns into a better performance by Lorenzo's Oil but is not in the same shape as "Weeds". Joe Don Baker has broad lines while Juliette Lewis proves once again that talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Any positive points? The opening credits (!), Cody's first sight of the back when he is immersed in prison, the scene in which Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowden's panic is in a state of complete panic, Cody is outwardly calm but unnerving . <br /> <br /> The worst? The "cleaning lady - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Clinging with bare hands to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Are there no bumps in the United States?) "He died - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" partS and the aforementioned wandering end. <br /> <br /> I could see the original again, but I still have to be tempted to watch the remake in four years from seeing it.
