The autobiography of the founder of the New York zoo begins with being very pretty and would be a family movie if it remained there. however, we are increasingly involved with reality, as the gorilla grows to become a wild thing, not easily adaptable to its "maternal" desires - this could frighten younger children especially. scenes in which Buddy tries to hurt Gertrude. rather fast resolution at the end. below average.
