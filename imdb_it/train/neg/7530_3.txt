I found this film boring, monotonous and completely uninteresting with a hurried and "optimistic" ending that did not sound true to the general story. Following these characters through a weekend of terrible events, hostile attitudes and bad news is not my idea of ​​a watchable and interesting film and I got very tired of his "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end ... in fact I'm almost stopped halfway. The whole film seemed useless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, even though the acting was good. A small film with small ambitions and little appeal - sorry, but I didn't make it with me, and I love good, small films! This simply didn't work, although I kept looking at it hoping and believing it would happen. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put her on the "Best 10 of the Year" list. I highly recommend watching "The House of Sand" instead - now there's a good, little movie!
