now don't get me wrong, I enjoy Christmas movies. I like a wonderful life and I really like the versions of a Christmas song with george c. scott and alistair sim. but this particular film is horrible. I think I love the song of life, the ghost of the Christmas song is particularly painful. albert finney sings quite well in Annie. I don't know what's wrong with this movie, but it looks like someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. the only thing that saved this film for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance numbers accompanied by the South Park Christmas cd.
