I just saw the movie at the theater. The film has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs could be. That's all. The film is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the film will be disappointed, even the Indians of Mumbai (right now Chennai has arrived in the semifinals). <br /> <br /> But the worst thing I hear about the movie is the action scenes. Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors take a lot of effect to make it real. But unfortunately Bollywood directors don't have much time. They spend their time on the songs and on the film's commercials. Now too stupid action scenes could work in the South, as the public only pays to see their favorite actor kill a lot of people. But in Bollywood it certainly won't work. All the action scenes I could have forwarded. Eventually even some Chinese appear out of nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is the height of stupidity. The public does not pay to see such stupidity. I think now Bollywood should forget about action movies. They can't make it. The last good deed I saw was from "Ghatak" and "Khiladiyon ka Khialdi". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Do these people see their movie after completion? Can't understand that the action in slow motion (which is done using ropes) is too unreal and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you can't handle it. I just want to go back to the Amitabh era where movies like Zanjeer and Deewar have had thrilling action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than the scenes of the current era. <br /> <br /> This film should now open the eyes of Bollywood directors. Please do not make action films until you acquire the art of making it realistic.
