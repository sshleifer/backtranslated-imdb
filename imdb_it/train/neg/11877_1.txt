I think this is almost all I have to say. I feel obliged to explain my actions though. I have hardly ever seen a production of such armor, and I mean this in every sense. Although the work with the physical camera, the operation of the boom microphone and other technical aspects of this film are ridiculous, unfortunately it is not the only area. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved from their scripts with great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has a terrible script, horrible acting and, worse yet, terribly annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that for every independent film it gets, distribution like Haiku Tunnel, there are another 101 indie films dead for dumb. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers know about Sony, but this may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production was ever distributed. I'm pretty confused as to why they chose this. <br /> <br /> The ONLY part of this film that holds back every intrigue is the title. However, the reason is even disappointing. I hope this review will save some people who might be intrigued by the title of this movie to go and see it. I've seen a lot of movies in my time and I'm very forgiving when I'm in the movies, but it was too much. I will never forget the "tunnel", for having marked an important point in my experience of cinema life. Too bad it's such a low point.
