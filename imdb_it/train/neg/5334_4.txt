After a few lean years, 1968 was a wonderful time for Elvis: not only did he make that famous "Comeback" TV Special but he also became a father and starred in two decent films as well ?? SPEED AND LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE. Therefore, personally I can forgive him for the misstep that is STARE FAR, JOE which, at best, emerges as an interesting bonfire and is not so bad considering. Sure, are Burgess Meredith and Joan Blondell really embarrassing? as, respectively, a crazy Indian father to the character of Elvis and a bawdy bartender who has his eye also on Mr. Presley - but one is glad to see Elvis surrounded by the most famous Hollywood veterans like Katy Jurado (like the Mexican wife of Meredith), the two Jones ?? Henry and L.Q. - and Thomas Gomez who is especially funny as the sarcasm Chief Thundercloud, who is Meredith's stubborn father who still wears his old tribal chiefs nowadays! <br /> <br /> While there is a surprising (if not unwelcome, given their usual blandness) lack of songs, it seems that there is no shortage of free parties for all the male Indians who hit the bottle constantly while Presley's practices his feminist skills behind their backs! As can be expected, the typically "western" scenario of Arizona is an important resource here and the sleepy and snoring bull gag is not only a good point but an important point of the plot. On the other hand, the "house destruction" episode has been seen too often since then and does not work very well here ...
