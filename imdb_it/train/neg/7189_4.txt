What an absolute disappointment! The score of 6.1 here on IMDb has raised some slight expectations but, oh my God, I was disappointed. The first thing that bothers me are those stiff and stereotypical university kids. Yes, I know boys can be childish and so on, but why are they always portrayed in movies as braindead morons? There was a character that I thought was fine, but he / she (not revealing him here) was killed off the road before the end. The other characters were badly executed and even the alleged hero / heroine didn't do it for me. The positive side: the plot is pretty good and the productions have a higher value for this type of film. The acting was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But everything fails with bland and braindead characters. Stop taking care of it after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and this is generous).
