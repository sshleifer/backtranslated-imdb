While it is early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was inferior to what I thought it would be. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it also had potential, but I was deeply disappointed. My instinct tells me that Enterprise won't be as bad as Voyager, however. <br /> <br /> Regarding the impressions of the pilot ... <br /> <br /> The pilot had some good ideas and good themes. I liked the introduction. The opening credits of the show were interesting, with the progress of the exploration and a song with a suitable theme. Scott Bakula is excellent as captain. <br /> <br /> Where I missed most of it was that the story lacked the "feeling" of leaving for a great adventure. The plot of the episode itself was more a "generic" Trek story with the themes of "exploration" and "first step into space" simply subplot and subtext. If I had to change the references to this being the first mission in deep space, the plot would be difficult to distinguish between the eras of Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot did not reflect or do justice to the great theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot of the launch of the first mission would have been quite large without "action". Instead of isolated references to the novelty of exploration, history could have been. Become a bit more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a TV show that would make us think again). Let us feel the excitement of the "wind" and stay on the "sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of shootings. There was too much shooting. <br /> <br /> We felt more like humans were the "freshmen" in an established school. New children on the block, instead of venturing into a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons landed on the doorstep instead of finding them. That meeting could have been much more historic and much more sociological. How do two different companies interact? Don't just mention this, SHOW IT! <br /> <br /> I had to think of it more as "Trek with a stingy crew and limited technology" in contrast to "the first brave steps into the unknown". I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept but so far I have not seen this great new concept. <br /> <br /> I will conclude by reiterating the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has potential. The general theme is the most interesting since we saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> Shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck Captain Archer. <br /> <br /> To the producers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE * THINK *! :-)
