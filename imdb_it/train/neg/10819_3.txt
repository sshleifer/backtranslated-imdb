I agree with one of the other commentators on the good story and the good but mismatched actors, and I would even say hurried. It's been about 24 years since I read the book as it was at school. But I felt you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when you look at this while the pieces are left out so it doesn't make full sense. For example, Jane and Mr Rochester have just spoken and are suddenly proposing marriage !!! Actors don't have the time to let the public know how their character feels about everything that happens in history. The actors are good but they don't have enough time to do justice to this story. I'm sorry to say but I didn't like this version very much. The 1970 version with Susanna York and George C Scott would be Jane Eyre's film of my preference, but you should look at the version of the 1983 BBC mini series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles. I love it so much that I watch it regularly. There is a reduced version which is valid for 225 minutes or the full version for 330 minutes.
