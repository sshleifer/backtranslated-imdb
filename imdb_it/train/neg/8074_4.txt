As a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has the heart in the right place, but it collects with a bad performance. Stephen Carpenter's writing / directing effort freely borrows other top films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give away the premise; suffice it to say that it is not so well managed here than in those two top films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller plays Cassie, who is about to go to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (unripe Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being chased by two killers (?) In transparent masks. It survives the shipwreck, but while attending college the visions of the horrid hospital and the dead reappear and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who died? Who is alive? What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors look like a bad exploitative movie for teenagers full of blood, splattered and dusty. True, it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (abundant, repetitive and foggy), but at least it tries to create suspense through ideas rather than clich√©s, unfortunately without success. It makes confusion much more often than cohesion, since the story becomes confused, disordered and inconsistent near the key points of the mystery (predictable as it is). <br /> <br /> Horror fans who take a copy of it have no idea they are for a film that is more interested in constructing an unpleasant reality facade than providing a body count. The credit goes to Carpenter for trying to create something beyond a teen derived horror film; pity that he created a psychological derivative thriller. Sagemiller also deserves compliments for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing his character and evoking a sense of emotion like the detangling Cassie. It's nice that filmmakers try something different, but the film ends with a mixture of bags and a failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
