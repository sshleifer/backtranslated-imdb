When this film was released in 1997 the "special effects", as they are, were poor. They would have been dated even to the 80s, and even some films made in the 70s and 60s have had the same or better SFX work. Certainly no one involved in the production of this film was looking for an Oscar. It's a wild departure from the usual stuff of director Fred Olen Ray, most of which has the word "Bikini" in the title (Bikini Pirates, Bikini Chain Gang, Bikini Girls from the Lost Planet, etc.) And they are little more than T & A, but here we are with a film with the word "U" and aimed directly at children. You must give him the credit for diversifying !! This was a small cult hit directed at the video, which later produced a couple of sequels: Invisible Mom 2 and Invisible Dad. Dee Wallace-Stone (whose career quickly went downhill after "ET" in 1982) plays the "invisible mother" of the film's title and will return for the sequel. Russ Tamblyn (whose career had been in free fall even more since 1961 "West Side" Story) plays the evil Dr. Woorter, it is probably fair to say that most of the cast was at the point in his career where they would be willing to work on almost everything just to pay the bills that month - except perhaps the young Trenton Knight as Josh, it is quite significant that although he worked before this film, this child actor has not worked since the sequel, "Invisible Mom 2 ". Maybe the movie was cursed, after all it wasn't so bad for a child actor, it's pretty good - it's not better or worse than any of its more experienced co-stars. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above , the effects of "invisibility" are very bad to say the least, the direction is poor, the obvious writing and the acting of which nothing is written nothing film rse out there, however, and for anyone less than ten years old, this film will be without dub bio quite watchable. Most adults will probably want to take an act of disappearance just while it's active, and I wouldn't blame them a bit!
