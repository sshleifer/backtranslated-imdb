Nathan Detroit organizes illegal craps games for high rollers in New York, but the heat is on and he can't find a safe place. Bet on the cruel player Sky Masterson that Sky can't make a primitive missionary, Sarah Brown, go out to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in store ?? <br /> <br /> This is one of those expensive '50s MGM musicals in bright colors, with great sets, loud music, bigger life roles and shows to match; Broadway has photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing, which I don't do. My main problem with this type of film is simply music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway songs in swing time with endless trumpet pah-pah-tah-dah at the end of every fourth bar are not my cup of tea. This was written by the tag team of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of stories by Damon Runyon), and while the plot is quite affable, the songs are weak. Blaine's two numbers, for example, are identical, unneeded, do not advance the plot and scratch their ears (and they are also obviously misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tracks, Luck Be A Lady (sung by Brando, not Sinatra as one might expect) and Sit Down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (well done by Kaye) but you have to spend two hours to get them . The winning card of the film is a young Brando who offers a thoughtful and relaxed performance; he also sings quite well and even dances a little, and is equally matched with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two escape to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, the commotion and the vocal murder of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals can dig this, but I think a musical has to do something more than just a movie about the theater show.
