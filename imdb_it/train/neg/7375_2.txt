This film was strongly marked by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as Steven would say so boring! As before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to rewrite his lines, letting someone play his voice for the shots where the sound had to be repeated. Some films before this was also made, but I don't believe so far! To be honest, the movie looks pretty good, the script could use some work but some parts of this movie looked like a real movie! Of course, all in all, this film is pretty ugly. <br /> <br /> It would have been much better without Seagal which has become a cartoon of itself. Don't worry. Something over a dollar for this is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and for a Seagal movie. What took me so long to accomplish this ?!
