Joe Don's opening line says it all about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (the island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker who tracks down an Italian mobster. The character of Joe Don is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this film is shoot people and get arrested over and over again. Everyone in the movie hates him, just like everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked a previous photo of Greydon, "Angel's Revenge" because it was a shirne for the guys from Thriteen. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
