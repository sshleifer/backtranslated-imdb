A pot - boiler if I've ever seen one. A supposed thriller that borrows from "A Time to Kill", "Silence of the Lambs", even an inverted "In the Heat of the Night" with a small reverse murder, a "Strangers on a Train" thrown in, fails abysmally where all of the above, to a large extent, succeeded. That is to say, in providing chills. The plot seems condensed from a larger book, making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving, while the direction lacks rhythm and verve. To keep the compliments at bay, an important turning point had to be delivered along the way and here it also fails in a palpable way. Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely worried about his attempt at an American accent, and he seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those damn damned children of his. He even has a father-in-law who looks younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely has a chance to live in his role and you're confused from the start whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do it, confusedly, here. The rest of the game is simply the average of a reasonable cast in their stereotyped subscribed roles. Even the alleged climax managed to roll, leaving me firmly entrenched behind, not as it should have been, the front edge of my seat. Certainly mediocre and mediocre films.
