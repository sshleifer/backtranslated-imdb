*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** From its opening titles this fantastic film establishes things to do: it is an instant classic. It doesn't take long to realize that this movie is big, bigger than "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7". His great greatness left me speechless when I left the cinema and went back to the ticket office to buy me another dozen tickets. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that simply requires more views. The first vision will surely leave you with that strange "Huh?" feeling, but not feeling embarrassed - it happens to the best of us. The story is so devilishly intelligent that one must wonder about the mortality of its authors. What looks like a simple story of an idiot who infiltrates the FBI turns out to be an allegorical story that works on multiple levels and teaches us all about the really important things in life. The complexity of the plot structure will surprise you with your first vision, but don't give up! Only after my sixth or seventh vision did I begin to unravel some of the hidden mysteries of "Corky Romano". And watch out for the unexpected turnaround at the end, otherwise you might be caught off guard when it is revealed that FBI agent Brick Davis is the most wanted FBI criminal, Corky is not a true FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent , Peter Romano admits to being illiterate and Paulie Romano comes out of the closet as a homosexual. Surprised to death, I can tell you this. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedic talents are unmatched as he guides his character, Corky Romano, through a maze of totally unpredictable situations. Recalling John Reynolds' performance in "Manos, the Hands of Fate", Kattan takes on countless multiple personalities and tackles all the scenes with perfect comic timing. However, Kattan is not just a matter of comedy. He is also a master of drama, as he controls the feelings of the audience with the smallest moves of his face. His facial expressions reflect life itself, in a sense. For example, in the scene where it flows in the faces of his brothers, you can see the expression of social injustice and alienation that is clearly reflected on his anguished face. At a time like this, it's hard to find a dry eye at home. <br /> <br /> The writers David Garret and Jason Ward are the true heroes of "Corky Romano". With a history of such proportions, it's easy to see why two experienced writers had to be employed to complete this ambitious project. Their skillful unorthodox narrative and structuring makes `Pulp Fiction 'a mediocre Saturday Night Live script. The story of Garret and Ward is so compelling and compelling that it grabs you by the hair, swallows you completely, shakes you and spits you out. At the end of the out of the world experience known as "Corky Romano" you find yourself a different person with different visions of the world and different ideas, and with only one question in mind: <br /> <br /> Why, God? Why?!?
