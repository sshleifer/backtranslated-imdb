I love Jane Austen's stories. I only read two of them (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this adaptation, I'm looking for "Persuasion" from my library just to make sense of the story, and also because I refuse to believe Jane Austen would could write such a nonsense. For me, I thought that if a movie is based on a Jane Austen novel, you can't really go wrong. Usually it will go very well by default. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, where are the characters you sympathize with and how do you like them? You must have at least one nice character to convince the public to invest their emotions in them, and this did not lead. Of course, I wanted Anne and Wentworth to reunite, but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is that they're together. Instead, I had to resist the pressure to throw my tea cup on the TV and keep watching it until the end. <br /> <br /> Anne was absolutely annoying for everything, and in the end, I really have no idea why Wentworth was so impressed with her, since it seemed like there was nothing she could be attracted to. He was mild, insipid, boring, socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following the instructions of everyone else rather than having his own mind. This can still work for a main character if you do it right. This was not done well. <br /> <br /> The other characters showed only varying degrees of narcissism, of which Mary was the worst, with a real narcissistic personality disorder. Where Mrs. Bennet in P & P had similar flaws, she was still catchy, while Mary was more than a strange show. More disgusting than funny. <br /> <br /> Wentworth was very handsome and looked like a decent guy. For most of the story, I was wondering what kind of person he was and why he was in love with Anne, as surely, he is the kind of person who would like a person who is a little more ... alive? As for acting, there is not much to say, because I reacted more to the portrayed characters than to how good / bad people were doing. Anthony Head was excellent, but as soon as I saw that he was there, I didn't expect anything less. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very confusing. It wasn't until the end of the film that it seemed that Elizabeth wasn't Anne's stepmother, but actually a sister (I'm not 100% on this yet). Anne / Wentworth's whole affair was also a bit confusing. Had they been together but then they broke up and are both embittered? Why? I was wondering about this for some time, and the explanation seemed to have been downloaded because she had been persuaded to do it by someone? But it has been said in a sort of "by the by" that is almost missed, as if it were somehow unimportant. How can it be irrelevant when it is the central core of the story? There was also a lot of names coming down, but no real feeling for who the characters were. For example, this person of Louisa, who was she? A friend? Family? What? It has not been made very clear who the different characters and their mutual relationship are. Lady Russell was there a lot, but why? Mrs. Croft and Wentworth were brothers and sisters, which was very unrealistic since Mrs Croft looked old enough to be her mother. <br /> <br /> The final kiss, yes, it was a bit weird that they kissed in the street, but I didn't think about it, because I was too busy shouting "TURN ON ALREADY !!" on TV, because Anne's lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what seemed like an eternity before they really met Wentworth's. There is some hesitation there, but only for a couple of seconds or so, not half a minute. <br /> <br /> Then there's the problem of working with the camera. Like a regular movie watcher, you don't pay attention to corners and the like, unless you decide to watch them. I didn't decide to do it here, but I noticed them anyway. For me, this means that the directors are not doing a good job. A lot of conversations were with extreme facial close-ups, something that should only be used when there is a really important point to make. In this adaptation, it was too used and therefore meaningless. The feeling of hand sometimes also did not work in a dramatic period. Even the camera in the running scene eventually felt too contemporary. (Not to mention the race itself.) This was the only Austen adaptation I captured in ITV's Austen season. I wonder if it is worth looking at "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" or if I should just read the books and let it go. I'm sad to say, this is an adaptation of Jane Austen that I didn't like. Maybe I'll look at the 1995 version instead. The BBC is famous for making beautiful adaptations of Austen before, after all.
