This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in it are completely random and have little or no meaning. The fact that there is a sequel is so disgusting that I could come down with a case of cabin fever (I'M SO SORRY). I describe it as an insect that is smoked in a newspaper because it seems that different parts of things are mixed together. for example Kevin, the boy of karate who loves pancakes, is strangely strange on his own, then there is the policeman who is a bit bizarre and perverse, then the addict, then there is the fact that they attack a random guy who clearly needs help. then suddenly the main character is having sex with his girlfriend of friends just because she says something stupid about a plane coming down. then finally a good old family racism followed by a rabbit working on Kevin the karate boy. It is actually rather contemptible that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There's no reason anyone can appreciate this movie if you don't love Eli Roth, even if that didn't make me love this movie. Hatred is a strong word, but since it's the only word I was allowed to use, I'll have to do it. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
