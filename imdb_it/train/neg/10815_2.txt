I love the book "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strengths and their flaws. However, this was one of the worst I saw. I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly seemed the simplest part, but she had no emotions in any of her lines. I couldn't imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /> <br /> This brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt also had less emotion than Jane, if it were possible. How two so insipid people can fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly didn't attract my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton's version (too good for Mr. Rochester!) is much more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version (which is NOT all true for the book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive in this film: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
