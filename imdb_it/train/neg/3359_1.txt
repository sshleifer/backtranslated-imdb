They ruined this story! In the end, Nell is all heroic and is committed to saving the ass from Hill House and a lot of nonsense like this! They added minced heads, wires that cut people's faces and the ceiling turned into a giant hand! What the hell are you talking about ??? I own and love the original film, I read the book and love it! The reason why the original film and the book are so big is because it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There is no blood. There is no hand on the ceiling. It is only the phantom announcement that ghosts can really kill a person. They can't kill us, they can't throw us around the room or fly a knife in our heads. No. They can only drive us crazy. Take away all our safety senses. Nell was a selfish woman. She just wanted good things for herself. Yes, she cared a little for others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have made fun of this great story! I hate this damn makeover!
