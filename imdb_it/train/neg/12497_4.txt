I'm sure the people on the Texas-Louisiana border must have had a good laugh or two when Paramount's image B unit inflicted this image on the war audience. Quite simply the area along the Sabine river where the film opens is the cotton campaign, just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was the post civil war. There are no large cattle empires there, they are far west of Texas, farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster can ride to create their empire. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the two of them in a river boat and when Leo Carrillo tries to steal their services, not paying them for transporting his cattle, they keep the cattle. And this is the beginning of the great Ponderosa as the ranch from which they begin. <br /> <br /> Along the way Foster marries Dix's sister played by Frances Gifford and comes to terms with her much smaller neighbors. They also have other contacts with Leo Carrillo. <br /> <br /> However, we westerners who are fond of westerns usually don't care about geographical nonsense and it's still a good western from the production of Harry Sherman who produced all those Cassidy westerns by Hopalong for Paramount . The highlight is a blazing, and I mean literally, shooting that should have been used in a production of A. <br /> <br /> But I would have had no fan except the western one watching it.
