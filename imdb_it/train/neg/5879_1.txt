I wonder how the actors acted in this film. Was Annette Bening really herself, half in and half out, pretending or being natural? It made no difference considering that even if he had walked on the ceiling he would not have changed the model of the film. Brian Cox played very well. I almost thought that he had always acted in this way, deceiving, dishonest, in a dirty environment where nobody really cared about hygiene. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, the question is what she was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is rather disgusting and disgusting. Who would pay to see such crap?
