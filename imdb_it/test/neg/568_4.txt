A really funny idea of ​​history with good actors but it is missing in some way. The actors are older but none of them seemed particularly good. They needed better makeup, a photograph or something. It should be a love story, yet the film had a more approximate appearance than a street film. I liked the cast but I think the performances were pretty insignificant. This is where the weakness of the director shows. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had directed Mr. Spielberg it would have been a much better film.
