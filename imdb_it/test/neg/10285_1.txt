There is a growing tendency in the media to denigrate and ridicule men. It can be seen in television advertisements and program plots. Cheaters are a good example, they could find a lot of cheating women but the vast majority shown are men, why? The main threat to the power of any government resides in the male population, they are less likely to respect authority and are more of a physical combat threat. One way to reduce the threat is to evade men in society through the media. Other examples of psychological propaganda are the criminal dramas full of virtuous policemen, including aggressive women with great jaws who accuse all those who object to trample on their rights and make those men feel like scum. In Australia, many male sports stars have recently been arrested for assault, doubt and alcohol charges, another example of the government controlling the populous male arresting their heroes and claiming dominance. Cheaters, aside from political machinations, are an invasion of privacy and a violation of rights, and most of these women assault men! If he were on the other side, men would be in jail !! If it were an honest show, they would find cheaters women, because they are usually not discovered due to the fact that their male lovers are happy enough not to have constraints and to go out without rocking the boat. Men's lovers want men to themselves and want to own and control men and therefore capture men anyway.
