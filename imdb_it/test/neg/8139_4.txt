The cast and crew of this economic horror potboiler are more interesting than anything that happens during the film itself; we have Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr., Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode in front of the camera and screenwriter and director Curt Siodmak, director of photography Charles Van Enger, editorial supervisor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen behind it. The unfortunate Payton turns the head of practically every male he comes into contact with in the African jungle where he lives on the plantation of her husband Cavanaugh: Dr. Conway secretly wants it while the foreman Burr's approach is, literally, more hands-on. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly enough) the relaxed yet conscious authority figure and Strode is a native police officer. The plot is very simple but, frankly, it doesn't make much sense: after a particularly turbulent dinner complete with thunderstorm, Burr and Cavanaugh (the art that imitates life later on) come into a fight in the garden for their affection for Payton and, conveniently for Burr, a big snake is about to crawl near where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Witness of the event from behind the bushes, Payton's enigmatic waitress (a native witch, no less), for some inexplicable reason, puts a curse on Burr (who has meanwhile married Payton) who periodically turns him into a gorilla. .. since his own wedding day (when his hand turns briefly into hirsute)! As a result, does Burr want to lose himself in the jungle for days and days ?? even if the same ape creature is barely seen throughout the film. It must be said, however, that the version I watched ran for only 56 minutes when the "official" length is given elsewhere as 66, 70 or 76 !! Therefore, the film feels understandably rushed and disjointed if ever less fun than it culminates culminating in the hunting by the gorilla of Payton in the jungle, with the first being chased by the armies of Chaney and Conway. To return to the tragic blonde actress of the film for a minute: after a promising start in the movies alongside Hollywood legends like James Cagney and Gary Cooper ?? in, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950) ?? his career soon crept into the class B (and minor) territory thanks to his "colored" antics off screen: his infamous crime was the cause of a much publicized brawl between her husband and Franchot Tone, brutal ex-lover Tom Neal who ended up with the first in a coma and Payton actually abandoned him for the latter shortly after !! But it wasn't all: the nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was among his conquests (a controversial topic at the time); Tone, a short-lived husband, having captured Payton's infidelity to the camera, released photographic evidence against Hollywood and did this virtually end his days as a starlet? his latest film was the murder of Edgar G. Ulmer MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955) which I have in my pile of "Unwatched Movies". Have the last 12 years of his tumultuous life been spent on Skid Row in the grip of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even stabs? first, in the end, he died in 1967 in his parents' house at the young age of 39!
