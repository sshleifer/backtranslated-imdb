This was one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. Everything in the film seemed to be connected to justify some other element that had been pasted. There is also a talking buffalo who wants to rub his wet nose to make the magic happen. Even the brutal father seems to be blocked only to give the children an excuse to fly away in a wagon. It was ridiculous, but in an unpleasant way because of the serious arguments that seemed to be used only to set the plot.
