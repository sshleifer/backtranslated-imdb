This film was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling some records. No seriously it was. The thought behind this is that if you made a movie full of pop songs you could paste the tracks onto an LP, sell it and earn even more for the studio. You can also publish some tracks as singles and interconnect the promotional video with the clips of the movie so that when MTV plays a song you are actually receiving free advertising for the movie. This is a good business but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about 80s Hollywood movies and I consider the mid-80s the poorest artistic period for American film production and FLASHDANCE opens its doors to this "We make a 90 minute pop video instead of a" making film "movie. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens, a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and immediately the logic disappears with this professional choice. Welding is a fairly sophisticated craft, it is not something you get in and learn in five minutes. There are other gaps in logic like ballet and "flashdance" is somewhat similar. apply to be a dancer and do a hot and dirty flashdance, male judges may want to meet you after the audition, but you won't get the job, it's like saying the script, fiction writing and writing theatrical are somehow the same when they are not <br /> <br /> But I imagine that none of this relied on Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the film. Actually, Lyne is almost a very sexy film, JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent. Fortunately I found out why his face is lit close up in the foreground while his silhouette is lit up in dark in long shots, except when the camera cuts the close-ups of his celestial body. This is because twice the body is used most of the time and often twice the body is a man! I bet there are some bad guys who feel guilty not to mention a little disgusted to know
