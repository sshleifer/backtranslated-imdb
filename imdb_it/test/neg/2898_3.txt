"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter The Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it is still a very bad film. Fans of martial arts films will not like it very much, because there is not enough action, but action scenes are often spoiled by laughable excesses and unnecessary violence. As if the film were not weak enough, the directors turned some parts into an idiotic "The Exorcist". The only redeeming value is the winning presence of the actress who plays the "dominated" heroine; she is a beautiful and athletic woman, whom the director does not forget to exploit in various squalid ways - she is just an aerobics teacher. I'm not interested in a little soft-core exploitation, but I don't have to pretend to be something else.
