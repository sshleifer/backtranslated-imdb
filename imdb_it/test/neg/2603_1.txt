Everything about this show is terrible. His premise even aims to get economic laughter with bad writing. A "dysfunctional family" - the theme has already been used too often, particularly by the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and lots of laughs. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of history in each episode, with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. Now, if this was original or funny, of course, I would think it was smart. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason the episodes are like this is because it's the easiest way to churn out episodes after episode of this junk. Much of this show is not original, and what is original is only lame. He's also incredibly rude and irreverent, which again can be fine if he's still smart. Even the animation is not everything, but from an artistic point of view, even this show fails, proving once again that Family Guy strives to make many economic jokes and easy shortcuts. People enjoy this show, and I don't really care, because people can enjoy everything they want, no matter how much you aim for the lowest common denominator. But no, I don't recommend it, especially for those who want to study film or become a writer someday. This is low-cost, inexpensive entertainment and has found success in this. The fact that this is so effective says bad things about America.
