Yes, it's pure garbage. It might be interesting for every guy who likes experimental cinema (like me) to see the small talk and do nothing for almost two hours, but it becomes very painful when you realize you've actually paid for it. Probably, this is one of those films that you love to watch for its total emptiness and nihilism. But I accept it for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
