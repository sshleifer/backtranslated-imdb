MAY WITH THE SPOILERS In the last four years I have been a passionate fan of Ali G. Sacha Baron Cohen is undoubtedly a very funny and intelligent boy and, in my opinion, his best creation is Borat which is as funny as Hell and quite shameless in what he does and tells people. <br /> <br /> Anyway, to the movie. I didn't bother paying money to see it in the cinema; I suppose because I didn't expect much, but when I took the DVD recently, I found it pretty sad. The best part of Ali who was taking the mickey from the others was largely missing and the plot script was damn terrible; hook all the car batteries together to blow up a safe - REALLY !! ?? <br /> <br /> This film goes to show that some things can work too long and certainly do not translate to the big screen. The film also had that sweet syrupy finish I expected from British films. Where have all the good ideals of British cinema gone? That said, there were some really fun moments like the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM the Q with the commentary "Shaven haven - RESPECT". <br /> <br /> So, in summary, I'm an Ali G and Borat fan and I enjoyed many of his interviews (especially the one with Anita Roddick from the Body Shop) but this movie really fell flat with me. If there is another film, I hope it is much better than this old tripe. <br /> <br /> Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
