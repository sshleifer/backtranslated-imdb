The Evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is foolishly unleashed to torture everything inside. What a movie loss! There is not a single scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna takes a role. There are some animated ghosts, an electric saw defacement and a phantom rape. Afterwards nothing special happens for almost all the movie The Evil is personified in ... Victor Buono. Great! From where the filmmakers had the idea that Good is scary. Looks like he was on his ass for a guest with a pay slip to pay the liquor bill. At that point it's too late to turn it off, because the damn thing is over. I thought I was throwing the videotape out the window. Please avoid this garbage! I hope you will never see the light of the DVD and it will fade into darkness.
