What gives Anthony Minghella the right to ruin two extraordinary fiction works ?? First, he destroyed The English Patient, which was pretty bad, but now I find out he slaughtered Cold Mountain - butchered !!! <br /> <br /> I had such a strange reaction to The English Patient. My son and I went to see him the first weekend he was released, and I was so disappointed, but I told my son that I felt like I needed to read the book. I went straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what the critics were talking about when they said that Minghella trusted enough of the intelligence of the public going to the movies to give them a great movie. This is what he certainly didn't do. <br /> <br /> Normally I don't read a lot of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I didn't see Cold Mountain, the movie, when he played in theaters, and it was because of what Minghella had done to The English Patient. But like a madman, I rented it today, and I'm so upset, I had to vent my frustration and, above all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and turned it into something just as beautiful on the screen, and now they never will. <br /> <br /> READ THE BOOK AND LEAVE THE ROT OF FILM ON MONTHLY. I will never be caught by a Minghella project again. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the Hollywood praise on his head. It must be that nobody in Hollywood reads anymore. This film bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego must have no limits, and if he didn't like the book, then why he didn't write an original script and left the book alone. Even if I hadn't read the book, I'd still consider this film one of the worst I've seen since 2003; and I saw almost everything that was published for the vision in the United States. <br /> <br /> Elaine, you won't like this either.
