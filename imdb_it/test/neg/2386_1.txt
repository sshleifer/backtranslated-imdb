"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that small-budget films that try to get less may seem worse, but I would say that an "indie" pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic film that pretends to be more is worse. <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson and I will never go back to the 91 minutes of my life that I lost in his film. <br /> <br /> THE SCREENPLAY AND CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> From start to finish, the script failed to provide an antihero or hero with a moral core that the public would like to see succeed or to fail. <br /> <br /> In telling stories, the three dramatic conflicts are man against man, man against world and man against himself. <br /> <br /> The script focuses on a group of college friends in New York, and is concerned about the dynamics of man against himself, in which each of the characters in the film is so absorbed by a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies before the eyes of the public. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters indulges in inexplicable misbehavior (heroin addiction with no story as to why the character is a drug addict; a girlfriend who has sex with his girlfriend's boss / investor, even if the character is written too smart to have sex with such a deranged character, a man who starts out as a good guy, but is attracted to an unbearable investor, and converts for some unknown reason into such a business cheat, a chubby gay cyber geek , who does nothing, but finds dates online and an Asian gay man who dates back to an elderly HIV-positive man, but has no scenes that establish why the relationship works and why love develops). <br /> <br /> Crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character's dependence, the suffering and self-disdain of the fianc√©e that could explain why she would have slept with an unpleasant envelope; the backstory that would explain why a decent boy would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" character and would become a donkey; a plot for the chubby cyber geek; and there are still scenes of interaction between the Asian man and the HIV-positive boy. <br /> <br /> Without appropriate details, all the characters' actions seem forced and forced. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SCORE <br /> <br /> I found Mr. Johnson's direction without a clear point of view, leaving the actors emotionally incoherent. <br /> <br /> Cinematography can be described as trivial at best. Mr. Johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to capture the grandeur of New York City. This failure created a claustrophobic film, regarded as the filming of a play, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was awkwardly absent from most of the film. I suppose Mr. Johnson is to blame, since he could have asked for the full score to improve understanding in every shot. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION <br /> <br /> "The New Twenty" is an annoying and utter dissatisfaction in the making of films.
