<br /> <br /> A few years ago I bought a movie called The Cellar. I had heard it should have been a great movie, but it turned out to be a flop and a B-movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but there are no good effects in the film. (Maybe they didn't have enough money for that on the budget ???). <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch this movie, be sure to watch it three times. The first, unique and last time !!!
