I do not know where to start. <br /> <br /> Huge continuity problems, bad acting, etc. For example, Sam should be away from any person, however it is possible to see the ski slopes carved into the mountain near his head. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventurism that paves the way to improve the destiny of his entire family, is not even touched. Instead, in the film, he is expelled from his family and leaves his wealthy parents alone and, when he gets tired, he returns home. Where is its development? Where is the bow? <br /> <br /> If you have never read the book and can pass through the hokey 60isms (double / triple / quadruple visions of the hawk) and the terrible quality of production (crackling, ahem, fire, winter the winds stop to scream for dialogue and then reboot, etc.) I guess * could * be OK for an 8 year old. <br /> <br /> But compared to the sophistication of the book it is a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
