The first half of the film is not so bad. Although there is not really too much depth in the characters, the story is somehow funny and generally okay with the potential to improve, which is not the case. <br /> <br /> In the second part things start to get worse, not only for the characters in the film, but also for the viewer, who will basically be waiting for the story to reach its obvious end. <br /> <br /> The previous user comment mentioned: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of errors, a movie from the 80s and above all, it's a film by Jonathan Demme . "<br /> <br /> Well, please allow me to rephrase that:" He is a boy who makes history of the girl, happens to be around in the car, the thrill is gone since it is too clear how things will evolve, there was no scene in this film that you could laugh out loud, have some light 80's feeling and yes, Jonathan Demme was really the director.
