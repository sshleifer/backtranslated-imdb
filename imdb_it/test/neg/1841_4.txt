I have to disagree with people saying that this is a horrid horror film with a good acting and a camera work - I would say it's a horror movie OK, RUINED by an incredibly abyssal acting and a poor camera - look instead Ju-on: The Grudge to waste your time with this junk. The main idea behind the film is quite original, considering the abundance of doll-based scare-killers who have been leaning on us over the years; unfortunately, the story is handled with all the subtlety of Michael Bay's latest action star, with a cast of characters that are uniformly unlikely and interpreted with perfect precision by actors supposedly sieved from Korean daytime soap operas. It's not scary and it only manages to dampen your expectations on the upcoming Korean horror film to come-to-call. Oh good.
