This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't want to remove the eyeballs forcefully after seeing Galaxina. It's just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but not up to par. All of them. The few gags that are approaching break down repeating them over and over. The production values ​​are, well, non-existent. The sound is ugly, the lighting is ugly, ... it just looks cheap; too much dialogue ... well, often missing - many embarrassing silences; they are all standing and it seems that someone should say something. The film also seems ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was intended as a comedy - as perhaps that developed after shooting. It looks like the film project of someone who threw together the night before it was due, and if it took them two weeks, it would have been nice. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought "mom and dad save the world" was a real blast. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is almost a classic. This turkey does not do it "Space Truckers" was more credible. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, which can be a lot of fun, tries too hard. His part requires a straight man, and he plays it by leaning on the sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is OK in her role, but not particularly noteworthy. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, "My watch is always slow". the line was fun. I will give this film all the compliments it can get, it needs it. <br /> <br /> Spacecraft models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. The space scenes are vague. No empty passage, no detailed close-up flight, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (The Infinite falls very strangely at one point.) The flight dynamics are terrible; worse than all you've seen, I'm jerky, not smooth. The initial battle is pungent and static; even if the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky way, they exchange shots (slow) at close range in a way that is more reminiscent of a 16th century naval battle, except not so exciting. <br /> <br /> Aliens - imagine if all Star Wars were the cellar scene. That many rubber masks could get boring rather quickly, right? Some are used as sight gags that work well the first time, but not the fifth. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, if you try to look at Galaxina, you are likely to fall asleep. (I committed to doing something else and I lost the last ten minutes, and it didn't seem worth seeing again. If that doesn't say "It's sucked", I don't know what it does.) Unfortunately, there is a lot potential, and this could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to do this again and have a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
