I would like to start by saying how much I love the TV series. The nature of class war would always have been a fun topic, but this television series exploits it better than most. The chemistry between Yootha Joyce and Brian Murphy has always been electrifying and the writers have written almost completely flawless episodes every time. In my opinion, is the best British sitcom of the mid-70s, surpassing characters like RISING DAMP, ROBIN'S NEST, ARE YOU SERVING? and so on. With the ON THE BUSES series completed a few years earlier, GEORGE AND MILDRED has become the next pride and joy of ITV (or ITV 1 as it is now known), enjoying a four-year run on the canal. <br /> <br /> However, the film is absolutely terrible in almost all respects. The general essence of the TV series was almost completely stripped by the authors of this abysmal film (which anyone will immediately notice are not the same ones who worked on the series). As one commentator has already pointed out, Mildred does not have the clarity he has had in the TV series and does not present himself in any way close to bullying. <br /> <br /> The plot, instead of focusing on the class war with the Fourmiles this was the very foundation of the TV series, actually writes the Fourmiles almost entirely after the first half hour. The plot, if you can call it that, consists of George and Mildred who go on vacation to some hotel and mix with the gangsters. Top-notch talent in the form of Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope, David Barry and Sue Bond are all wasted here. Most of these are far beyond their heyday and they all seem very embarrassed as if they knew very well that the only thing worth waiting for is a salary (which probably won't be much). <br /> <br /> The jokes and gags of the movie (if you can call them that) depend heavily on the traditional British farce, including incorrect identities, embarrassing situations, shoddy lousy, characters who lose control of what's happening to them and general confusion. And everything fails miserably. As another commentator pointed out, it seems that the authors of this film have never seen an episode of the TV series and instead have made something that looks like a CARRY ON movie. The scene in which George is laid bare by the character of Sue Bond is particularly out of context. <br /> <br /> A mystery surrounding this film is the BBFC certification provided - 15. Why is it rated 15 when all there is to see is harmless entertainment, not vulgar? <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, the era of the spin-off sitcom ended not long after the release of this film (shortly after the sad death of Yootha Joyce). And the company behind this film, Hammer, well known for producing top-notch horror films in the 1950s and into the mid-1970s, soon disappeared into total darkness. <br /> <br /> All in all, the film is an almost total failure. My advice: skip this and stick to the TV series. You will not miss anything, I assure you.
