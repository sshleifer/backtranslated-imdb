I was interviewed to see this from a girl ... John was a good boy, sweet, sensitive and looks fantastic without a shirt !! I thought it was a love story on both of them, but it mainly concerned his reactions to his letters. Savannah was a nice character at the beginning of the film, but once she downloaded it, I lost respect for her. He said he cut her up being away from him and it was hard - he was the one million miles away, he was killing people and the only contact he had was through his letters !!! He had no difficulties, he had family and money and he toured duty !! I was so frustrated when he forgave her - he was too sweet. I would have waited three years and welcomed him home with open arms.
