I have more testosterone than the next, and Raquel Welch is the best that is worth a look; but the fact is that a piece of cardboard could do better, and an hour and a half of Mrs. W showing her considerable resources does not make a film. <br /> <br /> Considering the cast, it's surprising that it's as bad as it is. I've never been a big Wagner fan, and Harry is just as convincing as a $ 9 ticket. Godfrey Cambridge and Vittorio de Sica, both of whom I usually like, seem to sleep in their lines; and as for Edward G ... well, I can only assume he was there for the salary. <br /> <br /> This film is a mess: from the non-existent storyline, through the stop-start action and the amusing puerile slapstick script and boring 'caper' 60s music. Had it not been for Miss Welch, I would have given a 0. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it is a real treat for the eyes - even better than her delicious cameo in 'Bedazzled' - and for that reason alone I have given a 3.
