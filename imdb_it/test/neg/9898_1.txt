I wish I had read the comments on IMDb before seeing this movie. The first hour was OK, although it made me wonder why everything was centered in Chicago and why no one reported any weather anomalies outside the United States. Isolated acts of nature (of this magnitude) are unthinkable. But beyond the first 60 minutes, the film drags on like an endless story. The script is horrible. As for the actors, very poor choice. Only people hired to panic stick to their roles. But I must admit that this film has good "special effects". If you rented it on a DVD and would like to see the movie, despite the reviews, then play it back at the maximum speed your player would allow!
