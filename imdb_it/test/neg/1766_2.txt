I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain". Alas, like most movies I'm really excited to see, it was a disappointment! If it wasn't for that miraculous invention called DVD, I think I would put my head through the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> I have looked closely at Kidman and Law when they meet because their characters are supposedly "destined" for one another. Yet Law's face showed nothing but stupid love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she returned to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we didn't understand him, banjo banjos marks every entry), and so over the top, it was all I could do to keep from laughing! Ironically, his performance serves to highlight how stark the gossip is. <br /> <br /> Ada is almost hungry because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More baffling is why none of them remained as Ada and his father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in a scene) it was a very dangerous time for the niggers (as they are kindly called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach you how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Why, why didn't he just sell the farm and go home? And for all the practicality of Ruby, when he casts Ada's "evil" cock, this guy puts the kibosh on them with more chickens! <br /> <br /> The moment his beloved finally returns, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else - that's the big joke! In fact, he could be physically intimate with Inman, but his real intimacy is with Ruby, who turned Ada into a version of herself by Uber-Babe. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left Inman behind? <br /> <br /> I doubt that Minghella recognized this because he was too busy making an anti-Bush film. Inman tells us that he is "like any madman sent to fight with a flag and a lie", and Ada's father says "I guess God is tired of being called on both sides of an argument". These "observations" are historically inaccurate and offensive. While slavery was at the core of the Southern economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was "a lie" (in fact, most of the ranks were indifferent). For filmmakers who print their opinions on a time when these visions were foreign to those who lived in that period is extremely hateful. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is rough and episodic. Law and Kidman are uncomfortable and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than a dialogue cooked in half and a group of clich√©s and platitudes. "Little moments like a diamond bag?" Ugh!
