I took my 4-year-old twins to see this movie today and I would NOT recommend it to children their age. <br /> <br /> This film has had many combat scenes in all this, which I found too violent and which my children found appalling. <br /> <br /> The subject was far beyond my kids and the death scene was too terrifying for a cartoon aimed at children. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because we couldn't wait to see this, but didn't cut it. If you have children under 7, I would not recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the most complete thing drove me crazy during the entire movie.
