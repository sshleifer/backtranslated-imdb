I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know much, so I wasn't sure it would have been worth it. <br /> <br /> History has done a great job to make me curious about these ruins they go to. The suspense continues when the Maya appear and force them to remain in the ruins. <br /> <br /> So the movie goes from a bit of suspense to useless. The amount of blood found in this film was not balanced against whether it was really necessary or used more for the value of the shock. <br /> <br /> The fact that they made no attempt to fight the screws from hell. They burned and did not try to burn it, nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly threw themselves into a victim's role and their impotent attitude was not real. It reminded me of old horror movies where people scream and scream and don't have half a brain to try to react.
