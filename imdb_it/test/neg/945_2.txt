this movie was really terrible. most of the comic scenes seem stale and trivial, and perhaps the most enjoyable scene in the film had already been distributed in the previews. the whole premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that it's hard to get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. it's not just the fact that the movies are so hard to swallow, but it's the way they keep it down your throat, expecting you to be surprised and accept it. the plot itself is so superficial and easy to predict. the boy is somehow rejected by every school to which he has applied (I suppose he has completely forgotten to attend college) and decides to create his school for the discarded comrades. all is well for a while until the validity of his school is questioned. All the while the crazy character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor to fall in love with him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill that only he possesses. then comes the final fight with the students somehow all united and fighting for the survival of the school. obviously the main character persuades the council of state to allow his school to stay alive with an "inspirational" speech. this film would have been more fun to watch if I was under 16 and still ignored all the issues and issues of college.
