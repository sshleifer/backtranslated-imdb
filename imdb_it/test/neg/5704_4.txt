So much for JUDGE AND JURY, who lives up to his meaningless title. What is it for? Lighting is terribly foggy! Another horror movie you ask? Well, this is perfectly explainable. David Keith is actually good at masking clowns, chefs and other cheaters despite being the murderer who escaped death row. But overall, despite some new twists, it's reasonably stupid. Unapix has recently published ridiculous productions, and that means only a lot. We, the jury, consider this film guilty for its indecent exposure to many of us sitting around believing that it is a total waste of our time!
