Just an hour ago I finished watching this friend of mine. As a Dragonball fan we think this movie is so bad that it's good. We will say one thing: without a beer for six, there is now a way to survive through this film. This film should be seen with many Dragonball fans laughing out loud. The best character in the film is the lord Corno, his make-up, his laughter and the cases of behavior, the unforgettable experience. What we liked about this film was the fact that the island of Turtle Man was the same as that of the cartoons. We believe that the only character similar to the cartoon character is Turtle Man. He is also a sex maniac and also a type of idiot.
