Reopens a cinema with a bad story of gruesome murders. Of course, the bloody killings start again. Written, directed, filmed, scored and edited with a frightening lack of talent and refinement by the singularly talented Rick Sloane (who later disgraced celluloid even more with the absolutely atrocious "Hobgoblin"), this horrendous attempt to fight something rotten in every way imaginable: the frighteningly lethargic rhythm, the painfully static and grainy cinematography (there is a smelly surplus of magical shots in evidence throughout), an annoying hum and redundant hum'n'shiver synthesizer, the apartment (not ) directing, a boringly speaking and uneventful script, the sophomoric sense of a sense of humor, the bloodless set of murders, a pitifully treacherous homicide (it's just a wrinkled old man in a colorful trick), uniformly hateful and unattractive characters, an abrupt unsatisfactory ending, and lifeless performance by a decidedly carefree cast ensure that watching this schlocky swill is fun and rewarding it sings like eating rancid raw eels soaked in vinegar vinegar. This raw totally lacks the necessary and crude charm and sleazy force required to be nice rubbish. Instead it is just a bland, enthralling and tortuous that does not catch fire or even becomes remotely funny in such a poor way. Only a hint of nudity and the delightful presence of the ever-reliable Mary Woronov as a sardonic and unnerving secretary provide some relief from the general cruelty of this bad loser.
