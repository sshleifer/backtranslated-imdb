Mah. Soul Plane was to be a "black comedy" parody of a very famous film, Airplane. This film is a black comedy made for the worst. Stereotypes can be fun, and many times they are. But in this picture, it's disgusting. Okay, you've got clubs, sex, drugs, everything that people associate with "urban" culture today. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Tom Arnold in this film is the saving grace of this film, if he ever had one. DL Hughley should never have accepted the script. Kevin Hart is a leading figure in this area ... his appearance in this film will probably become annoying to many. The appearance of Method Man and Snoop was by far the worst. <br /> <br /> I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch this movie ...
