If you plan to rent (hopefully not buy) this movie, think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun to his head and was forced to behave or die. I just wonder if Busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to act in this film because I don't see the guy who played so well with Keanu Reeves in this game at Point Break. It was a pleasant film, but there are thousands of other wellness films that make you laugh without you wanting to get your money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would ever tell anyone to rent this movie is to watch this movie and see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good funny movie, pass Quigley and go hire Spongebob or something.
