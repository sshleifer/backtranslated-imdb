As a fan of ancient cinema, I had heard a lot about the controversial film CALIGULA, which was ambiguously rated as one of the most realistic films of some and one of the most disgusting porn movies of others. I decided to see it in the entire full version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would do justice to the many accusations made against the film. I sat in my chair one autumn evening and started watching. The initial New Testament quote shocked me a little and raised the first controversy in me ... why put a phrase from Mark's Gospel into the pagan Rome movie? But the pastoral scene of prelude with a young, half-naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) that ran hopelessly through the meadows seemed rather sentimental. The music that played memorably while the end credits also provoked me in a positive sense. And yet, the negative feelings aroused in me quite soon, particularly at the death of Tiberius. Cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality was exaggerated. However, it wasn't so horrible in the middle. During the second part of the film, I felt like I hadn't watched any historical epic films but extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself "This is one of the films that you can really hate" ... I am aware that a film could be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go so far in removing all the limits of taste. I hate this movie for many reasons, but in particular one. <br /> <br /> CALIGULA is not intended for an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and founder of Penthouse magazine pornography, aims to combine film art with porn. I mean, I think, the most serious thing that the film can be accused of. The film is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by a feeling of epic grandeur while this film kills all the limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of the human being in the most wicked and decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are people whose psyche will not be affected by them. Some say that Rome under the reign of Caligula was so brutal. Yes, it's true. Corruption flourished at that time, various sexual deviations were preferable to Roman citizens. However, I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so rigorously and to make it an emphasis of an ancient epic. I think this proves rather the bizarre psyche of the producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> HUGE HISTORICAL ERRORS: Gore Vidal's script is known for its inaccuracies. It is evident, for example, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Still, the film shows him as a simple soldier on which Caligula forces his most decadent ways of torture and rape. Furthermore, Livia was not Proculus's wife raped by Caesar for her wedding. What lies behind the change in the stories of historical figures in stories full of incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travisia is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is introduced as Caligula's wife along with Drusilla, her sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after his sister died. The sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical basis. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director who has nothing to do with historical facts. <br /> <br /> TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From a technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography cannot boast of being exceptionally beautiful and even costume sets are not exceptional. However, the film's only strong point is its performances, in particular that of Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. It does a perfect job in the main role that represents the madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall increases the value of the film. If everything annoys you in CALIGULA, you could at least admire his performance. I also imagined Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love with his sister). Even Sir John Gielgud in the shoes of Nerva and Peter O'Toole in the shoes of the old Tiberius are memorable. O'Toole makes his best acting piece in the sequence of the Grotta di Capri depicting the decadence and the discharge of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only thing I like about CALIGULA is the performance. Therefore, I don't classify the film in 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes together with little continuity. Let's analyze only the beginning: Caligula arrives at Capri Grotto where he sees the terrible pleasures of the old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed is a bad omen. And immediately the characters are back in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying ...? <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't recommend seeing CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read the wonderful novel by Robert Graves I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch the mini series by Herbert Wise with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, in its majority, a porn movie that should never be called epic. <br /> <br /> There are films that are truly artistic and refine the taste of people's beauty, <br /> <br /> there are films that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer, <br /> <br /> there are films that show extreme violence; yet they still convey a bit of morale, <br /> <br /> there are, however, films that show sickness and decadence for their own good and consequently harm people's minds, <br /> <br /> unfortunately belongs to the last CALIGULA group
