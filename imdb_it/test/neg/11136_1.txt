I hate movies that like this !!!! <br /> <br /> This 16mm disaster is full of clich√©s, stereotyped characters, a generic and finished "plot" and a terrible dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this "movie" we find Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian "hacker chick", the pedophile teacher ... Blah, Blah, Blah ... And then the pumpkin man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone is taking the legend too far?" This question is addressed towards the end of the film. Taking the Scream 2 tagline too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** I don't usually go to spoilers but I have to rant .... <br /> <br /> A dream? Everything was a dream !!!!! This is the most suffered way to end a movie. "I don't know how to explain all this, and we have no more money ... We do everything like a dream." This is what the FX director / producer / actor / guy must have thought. Yes, the director is Mr. E's character. He did almost everything in this junk movie. This is an ending that ends up ... And what about the headmaster, okay, so he did all the kidnapping! What did this have to do with the movie? Of course the Blacks are killed, the bitch is killed, the teacher who has a history of sexual harassment with the students is killed (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This film gave me the heart. <br /> <br /> Useless, senseless and done with parents Visa and Mastercard (which tells me that it will probably still be repaid), this film is stupid, boring and simply stupid. ... <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked was the credits. The way they presented the names, etc., at the beginning and at the end. He had a disturbing feeling. Too bad the film didn't do it! <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
