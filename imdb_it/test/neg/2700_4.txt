Amnesic women who take off their clothes from the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) They are the only highlights of an otherwise slow and aimless film. Although the basic premise of the story offers many possibilities, they are never satisfactorily developed and the exposure is almost non-existent. Much of the film is a simple wandering in the corridors of a multi-storey clinic / hospital. The overall effect is gloomy and sterile, in the THX-1138.
