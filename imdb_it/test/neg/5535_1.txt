The Gun is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comedians is very poor, the dialogues seem to be written by a 13-year-old teenager, the plot (which plot?) Is another "suspense" in which it is very difficult to enter. Finally, nothing in this film is good. A nice thumb down to everyone involved and in particular to the Montreal film festival that presented this film IN COMPETITION!
