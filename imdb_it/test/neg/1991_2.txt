I have to ask, do films like this get their support from people associated with the film itself who come here and criticize it? How can something so horrible mark so high? My parents went to see many of the more adult themed movies when we were kids, whatever contained an R until we were old enough. I only remember two films that made them say yech! when they got home. This is "Catch-22". <br /> <br /> The film is composed of doctors and staff inconvenient in a lousy hospital, disconnected narratives and a bunch of people from the city center (which look like scraps of a 1970 Norman Lear sitcom) stage a protest. The worst part is the "mystery of murder", an old fool who does "the work of God" by killing doctors and others. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotion. They only care that he goes out from there where he will be "safe and happy". A doctor who falls dead of a heart attack is as false as the man so that he can escape. Oh, my, what a funny movie. <br /> <br /> This movie didn't make me "think", laugh or have other feelings besides "Must improve", but it never does. People wonder why it was a failure, no wonder here. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. Yech.
