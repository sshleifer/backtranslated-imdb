River Queen attempts to package a complicated, overwhelming historical tale in just under two hours. There are some breathtaking battle scenes and Wanganui's scenery is magnificently captured. However, the film suffered from some negative clues - Samantha Morton (Sarah) especially stumbled unconvincingly. There seemed to be an indecision about how the role should be interpreted - like a helpless slip tossed by fate or as a strong and determined character with a clear vision of his destiny. Kiefer Sutherland's character - private Doyle - seemed to be useless and mostly unintelligible. Keifer's Irish ferret needs some polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (like the son of Sarah "Boy") were well rounded and credible. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of River Queen have been particularly compressed and rushed. They seemed to have decided to tie the ends before 120 minutes had passed. For example. How the hell did Wiremu know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie with an open mind. I had not read or heard anything very different from his problematic production. What I experienced was a mixture of New Zealand history, beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing.
