The only reason I rented this film was that Val Kilmer rarely starred in a bad movie. There is obviously a first time for everything. In many ways, this film shows that aviators are not as easy to implement as we think, especially by foreign directors. The only one who probably got away was probably Sergio Leone, but even his films lacked something indefinably innate in our psyche and American panache. The American actors Clint Eastwood and Henry Fonda helped. Now I understand why they changed the original title from "Summer Love" to "Dead Man's Bounty". That same one tells me that the producers and the director had no basic knowledge of a western other than those scenes of shoot'em up and violent themes. I suppose we can say the same about American filmmakers trying to make a Polish movie while failing miserably in the process.
