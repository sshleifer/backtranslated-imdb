Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) A Jewish boy named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) A brilliant detective was eliminating the least intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish kamikazes !! This was good. (4) Hitler and his best guns went to see a film in central Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! Hit me. (5) Brad Pitt exaggerated and it was painful to watch. (6) Mr. QT is rewriting the story, "Hitler was killed in a theater ?? really!" the funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will really believe in this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally someone can tell me, how this film has reached the best 250 films of all time !!! Shame shame shame, I still wonder how everyone can like this movie.
