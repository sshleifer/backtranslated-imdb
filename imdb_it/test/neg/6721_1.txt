There are films that are not published in cinemas but on video. This should be allowed to age and disintegrate the way the old stock of nitrate films does. No story, inept violence, besides acting, badly written and the sorry thing is that the star was not the only negative part of the film. And I liked it and enjoyed some of Siegel's other films.
