It had just been broadcast on the UK science fiction channel on July 5th, it was ****. Shame on JRD! He could be bored a week! It cannot be skint after LOTR. I guess it wasn't to blame. Mr. Sheppird was. I turned off after 50 minutes, I couldn't stand it. The CGI ship was bad and the creature looked like a big 5-foot bat. Who financed this project? I think it all costs $ 250 dollars. Avoid at all costs, don't think about buying the DVD if you release one, I can't imagine that they would spend dollars to produce one. We hope that someone will produce a decent Chupra film and a decent BIGFOOT film. Sasquatch was okay, poor Lance. It's a shame a big studio and don't risk it, no more superhero movies please!
