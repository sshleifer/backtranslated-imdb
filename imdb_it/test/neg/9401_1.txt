Well, to get divorced in America with more money than the brain buys a run-down villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, despite having to quarrel about the price, later manages to cook sumptuous buffets for his workers and wander around Italy indefinitely without work or apparent means of support.) Endless boredom and the inevitable Italian lover derive from it; this is a chicken hit in the pejorative sense of the word. Lane behaves like a naive disinterested teenager for everything - which clashes dynamically with his faded looks - down the street breaking through a variety of stereotypes of cardboard (especially Italians), embankments, divas, age-old countesses and gigolos among them. Swollen with useless scenes, being more ridiculous is an awkwardly inserted and useless recreation of the fountain scene in "La dolce vita". (A similar presumption was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in "Solo tu", Norman Jewison's widely superior hatred of Italy and romance). 'Tuscan Sun' could be the most empty piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its vistas clearly declared in Italy. Bonus negative point for the last-minute parachuted lover to provide the necessary Hollywood finale for his targeted audience of Oprah brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you see Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent speech.
