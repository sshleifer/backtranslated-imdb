I got to see this movie without commercials, and let me tell you, even for a TV movie it was quite predictable. The actors did a laborer job with what they had, and the cast was well done - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. However, the script was not only predictable (except for the last scene), but the dialogue was like being relieved by a third-class love story. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were ridiculous. I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that anyone who is so disturbing can't arouse suspicion. Evil as Theresa Russell was in "Black Widow" - and surely shook him - at least he had the good sense to play his pseudo-characters somehow straight. Seymour is a much better actress but has not passed the material here. <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack is incredibly poor. It is almost a satire of its kind, like a fusion of Kenny G. A film with such a dull and derivative script should have gone for something edgy.
