As many know, this is the film debut of Edward D. Wood Jr. as a writer / producer / director / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for several years. Although I don't like it as much as some of his other films, it was probably the greatest insight that film audiences get for Wood during his lifetime. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This film is about sex change and how a transvestite can create conflicts in relationships with loved ones. This film is far ahead of its time in addressing this topic and how to deal with it. However, the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialogues, footage of insignificant stocks and hockey special effects. Launch the usual overdose of Wood by Bela Lugosi and take Wood's first attempt to be a director. <br /> <br /> The plot is that a police inspector goes to a doctor after discovering the body of a transvestite who committed suicide for advice on how to avoid further problems in this regard. The doctor tells him the story of Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but he can't tell her his secret. He also tells Alan's inspector that he undergoes a sex change because he is much better suited to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add a sort of ongoing commentary on what is happening (the part of Lugosi is not really well defined and is most likely a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get something cash). <br /> <br /> All in all, the film shows the hallmarks of Wood's career. Obviously it was shot on a very low budget and has some things thrown in rather randomly. He definitely has the feeling of "it's so ugly, it's good". However, I have to applaud Ed for his progressive thinking in making this film. Transvestites and sex changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 1950s. Wood took a big risk in making a film that depicts transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and who give a more human face to dressing up.
