Without a doubt, one of the worst films ever made. Slow and without structure, tension or history, the film develops on the subtle premise of "putting together a show". Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their creation and the dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often "Stepping Out" looks more like a reel of deleted scenes than a real movie. The film seems to exist only as a showcase for garish and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in octo-epic "Tentacles" far superior, and the Liza REALE can be found in the Showtime release of "Queer Duck: The Movie".
