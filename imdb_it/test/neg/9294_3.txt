A very delicate subject - a 15-year-old girl abandoned by her mother as a child and going to visit her, continues to be ignored, is raped by her mother's boyfriend, becomes pregnant. There was not enough depth displayed of this situation. Too much time is taken in pursuit with the truckers carrying the child. (Interesting, this child with asthma - you never see him crying - except once - being fed, having changed his diaper during the whole truck transport ordeal.) more attention to the fact that this girl was a minor - this should have been immediately in court. <br /> <br /> And this was a true story! It deserved a better story than that !! <br /> <br /> If it weren't for the topic, I would have given this closer to a 0 rating. I rented it from the library. Only later did I find out that it was a TV movie. <br /> <br /> oh well
