The bipolarity of this film is exasperating. One moment he is making fun of Latin Americans, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other wants to be moving, with burned and orphaned villages. Even the serious revolutionary hero becomes at some point a parody of a revolutionary. But the comedy parts aren't even funny, because it's so obviously stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a thief with a heart of gold. Add to these stereotypical, Latin American sound effects that speak English to each other, and a villain that disappears from history. And what's the point? It is basically revolutionary propaganda without resolution and without planning (because, there is really no way that these people can lead a country). The US government is bad, but who will make money by producing this? Certainly not a poor peasant, that's for sure.
