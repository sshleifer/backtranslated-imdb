This film, although well filmed and superbly performed, was terrible. I felt like I was witnessing a car accident - of course I kept watching but I really wanted to turn my head. The plot leaves little to be desired, it was extremely uneven and the finish was abysmal. Although, he adapted the tone of the film, I was hoping for something to improve this film. I still don't understand the references to anger and the child who let themselves be taken by the fox at the beginning of the film. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. It's really sad to see a movie with excellent actors and a beautiful set wasted on such a horrible and terrible story. There's not much more to say about this movie. Save time and look at c-span. It will be more uplifting.
