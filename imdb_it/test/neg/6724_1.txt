I usually like Steven Seagal's movies a lot. They are usually very funny and being a little skilled in Aikido, I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial arts techniques into combat sequences. <br /> <br /> However, this film is a bad movie that makes it hard and it seems obvious to me that the fault lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie, not to mention direct someone like Steven Seagal and exploit his knowledge and skills. <br /> <br /> I've never seen the end of this movie. I went out before the end simply because I couldn't stand the vision of this bad movie anymore. I'm sure many people also share my feelings.
