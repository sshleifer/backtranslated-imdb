This film was a classic in my part of the country because it was shot in my small town. Now I have many friends who are guardians of Dixon Correctional, and I myself worked for 3 years at the Super America store next to the Krogers store where the old lady was. However, this is still the most stupid film ever made, intended to be introduced by Gilbert Godfreid or Rhonda Shearer, if it has not already been. A bit of a curiosity, Illinois doesn't even have probation hearings, and Dixon Prison is a medium-security facility that houses thieves and vending machine vandals. The classic clucking / seduction scene is perhaps the funniest piece of text I've ever seen, especially with the accumulation of suspense
