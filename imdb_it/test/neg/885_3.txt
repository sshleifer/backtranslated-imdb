I like all the different types of movies, so it's not a romantic movie about a guy who only likes The Matrix and so on. <br /> <br /> I just thought it was a bad movie. I don't think there is enough accumulation of characters to fall in love with. Were they there for a few days and while dealing with a severe hurricane and major problems in each of their lives, Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall hopelessly and desperately in love ?? It's not realistic This film didn't let me buy and feel it emotionally and this is something you are looking for in a good storyline. Some emotional connection. If someone manages to relate to them, falling in love so quickly, without any real substance, so be it. You have neither reason nor wrong. Different tracks for different people. <br /> <br /> Another truly incredible component of the film was the very rude teenage daughter of Diane Lane who became nice and understanding at the end of the film. Is a teenager who is so unhappy and irritated by her mother for not coming back with her traitorous husband about to light a switch and be nice? This film, in a nutshell, had some big names, but for me it was a big disappointment.
