I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed boring to me, as much as I liked watching Penelope Cruz, and often the details of the plot didn't work well. It also seemed an intensely sexist film: if gender roles had been reversed, almost all of them would have been in arms to complain that the film was intensely misogynistic. It is not only that both major males are portrayed as complete jerks and sexual predators, but also that women are portrayed as almost impeccable, forming a utopian community that has no conflicts of any kind and is based on inexorable generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously boring and this is no exception. But it is also interesting to note what happens (and here comes the tribute plot, even if it refers to a scene very soon) when the teenage daughter kills her father. (1) His mother rushes to take responsibility and (2) her daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and indeed her emotional life disappears from the film). It is not a glorified homicide, even though Aldomovar's camera lingers on the blood in a bloody way, as if he were making a beautiful painting, and then it is absorbed and hidden without bleeding neither the daughter nor the mother, neither materially nor emotionally. Later the film reveals another kill, still by a woman of a man, and once again it is a murder that the film implicitly supports. In short, Volver is a film driven by ideology with an unpleasant and indeed repugnant ideology, and therefore I write an ideological critique. But apart from that, it's not very interesting. It doesn't have the depth of, say, Aldomovar's Talk to Her, which I loved.
