Watchable but rather terrible. How shocking that this was Gregory La Cava's great credit for directing! Even in his best known roles, I don't care about Gene Kelly. I seem to be smug, hostile and self-involved. Here, paired with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, she seems to show off those swords features. <br /> <br /> Marie Wilson, who plays an heir who falls in love with a soldier, is exceptionally tough and unpleasant. The actors seem to work hard to overcome the hard and unpleasant core of the image and they do it well. <br /> <br /> The butler known to all is apparently destined to be fun but it seems like an extended riff on the perfect pieces for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and in which, despite their stereotypes, he was generally funny - a unlike this guy.) Phyllis Thaxter is as always very attractive in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.
