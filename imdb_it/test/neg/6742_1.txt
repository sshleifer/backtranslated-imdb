This film is so ugly that there are no words to describe it. If I had a camera of a monkey dancing for an hour and a half it would have been a lot more fun than that. The plot is so boring and unimaginative that it's not even worth mentioning. The best part of the film was when the credits went on stage and I had a laugh to know that the names of the main actors were James Bond III. Trust me and stay away from this pile of rubbish!
