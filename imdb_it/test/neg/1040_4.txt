Where do I start, is one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen because it makes a lot of sense from the point of view, but it turns out to be really stupid. A movie about a bed inhabited by ghosts ?? The first 2 minutes of the film show a black and white flashback of a strange looking fat guy who dominates a Fabienne of the winner of the Pulp Fiction look-alike contest and strangles her with a tie. This should configure how the bed factors in history. However, if you want an opening to keep people interested or send them away soon, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day, a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and starts unpacking their belongings, so far everything is normal. Then, one night while making the hippity difference on a single mattress, they realize that they need a bed frame. This is where things get hurt, why didn't they bring in or buy a damn bed frame before getting there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place does not open, but once the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They climb into the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to take it downstairs and their days of love are saved ... or so they thought. The rest of the film focuses on the fact that both are haunted by the bed frame. The female is an artist so she starts to draw the macabre images she dreams of and the male is a photographer, so she starts making sure that her models behave as tortured or tied (one of which has gray hair and appears above 50 years, worse) The female becomes increasingly scared and discovers that the house she lives in is once a refuge for murders and mass murders that lead to the end of the film. They find out that the beloved landlord is murdered (which makes no sense since the ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to pull themselves out to dodge. While packing, the husband goes up to the attic morally where he is possessed by the fat and crazy guy and the female hits him before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills a guy trying to hit her. <br /> <br /> Well, if you've read until now, you have to think about something ....... WHY HELL DIDN'T DO ONLY BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW ???? Seriously, they never said anything about the real house that is haunted, only on the bed ... so why not get rid of that damn thing and move on? This is why the film is so frustrating because it is actually a good storyline and the actors follow suit, but there are more holes in it than in Sonny Corleone at the exit. The couple tried to leave the city as it rises to all the other films that have the program "oh let this place happen a little luck", so propose to that. However, my friend and I watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes ... why didn't they throw the bed away? Especially once they learned that it was haunted it would be a good time to set it on fire or something. <br /> <br /> All in all it is an almost invisible film with a lot of porn as bed scenes and a credible plot (in part) but the solution is so simple that you are scratching your head at the end of the film asking yourself can the spouses be stupid? The highlight of the film is when her husband tells the 50-year-old model to spread her legs and her assistant tells him he can't shoot her that way. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (a low porn budget The Man Show would love it)
