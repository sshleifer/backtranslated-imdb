Have you ever noticed how so many really bad films attract so many votes? Not much of a Riddle as it happens, but that's not much. There are two ways to see it distributed in the Sunday mail. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can't complain too much. 2. It's free, so it can't be very good. <br /> <br /> My vote is number 2. The free DVD in Sunday newspapers is a recent trend and some great old movies have been given away. They are the ones who have been out for years and have made most of the money they will ever make, so it is the case that anything else is a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for the new ones, so you can guess how bad it must be to skip the TV and DVD rentals. <br /> <br /> The positive points are that Vinnie Jones tries hard and Derek Jacobi is as good as Dickens. Negative points are a longer list. Trying is not the same as succeeding for poor Vinnie and the other character of Jacobi is a proverbial chatterbox who has gone away. The story is very weak. The Dickens story has nothing to do with the murders in the movie and feels like another film slapped on the screenplay to make it look like a British Dan Brown without religion. The supporting cast is there for the money (Vanessa Redgrave must be really tough) or because they are friends or girlfriends of the directors. It is also very, very long for what it is. <br /> <br /> Vinnie who brings his priceless Dickens story with him into his jacket pocket is good for a few laughs, but that's it. Not fun and not very good even for free.
