After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget films "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Önsjön" and "It came from space ... and stuff" were involved in making this film, I decided to buy it unseen on DVD. I wish I hadn't. The other films were funny, ironic and a little stupid. While Kraftverk 3714 is devoid of any humor. And it's so terrible that I'm getting angry just thinking about it. The worst possible actors, the worst possible script, the worst special effects available. And the most heterosexual sex scene ever. Uhhh. And it all goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please never make another movie.
