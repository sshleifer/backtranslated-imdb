It is hard to believe that there are some people in the world who think this is a worthy Charles Bronson vehicle. <br /> <br /> Bronson is a good actor who can do more than a gun and eliminate the bad guys. He quietly moved into the TV movie "Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in the film directed by Sean Penn "The Indian Runner". <br /> <br /> In "The Evil That Men Do", however, Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and puts it in place with fists, knives and, of course, guns. There is nothing here that you haven't seen in the last five "Death Wish" movies. <br /> <br /> Wait, I'll take it back. This must be Bronson's most sadistic and repellent film that has ever had the disservice of being inside. Not only repellent in torture scenes or torture descriptions, but in the fact that these scenes were included in a movie selling tickets. And Jose Ferrer! What was he doing in blue flames here? !! I mean, he won an Oscar for shouting loud !!! <br /> <br /> Ok, I'm sorry for that outburst. Let me say that "The Evil That Men Do" must be one of the worst films I've ever seen based on a book. Yes, that's right. I wonder if it was written with Bronson in mind? <br /> <br /> No stars. Look instead at "Death Wish". At least IT was topical.
