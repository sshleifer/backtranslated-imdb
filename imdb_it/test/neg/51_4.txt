One of the last great successes of the screen of horror, Conrad Radzoff, dies and his body is placed in a mausoleum with television fragments before the death of the great Conrad who greets you while you visit. Unfortunately for him and his captors, Conrad's body is "borrowed" from a band of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge manor where they drink with him, toast him, dance with him, laugh with him and against him, and then they put him to bed in a coffin that just happens to be in a room upstairs. The news of the missing body reaches Radzoff's widow and her friend (who has experience in the dark arts) and holds a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life, so he can, in his own words, get "an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth. "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "film. Sure, it's cheap. The sets seem to be borrowed (which I'm sure they were). Special effects and blood and guts are made freely and with little credibility. Acting is average below average with few exceptions. Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator is famous, but in reality he does little in this rather ungrateful role of a teenager obsessed with the horror that needs to steal the body of a dead person for kicks. None of the "children" except the beautiful girl who plays Meg is good. Nita Talbot plays the "friend" of Radzoff with passionate interest. Also, look for the big - I mean the big one - who plays the cop. This is the same Porky of the fame of Porkys. But luckily for all of us, a performance exceeds the material. Ferdy Mayne, an actor often overlooked by Germany who played Christopher Lee and played as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does a commendable job as the ancient icon of horror in public life and a true demon of a man private life . Conrad Radzoff in an ugly human being in life, living solely for his pleasures and we see him killed twice before he even died (obviously none of the teenagers swinging at that point). Mayne is able to look very regal, speaks very elegantly and transmits the threat with ease. If for no other reason, you should see Frightmare for his performance. I want it; however, they believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff they used the Christopher Lee video (does anyone have any ideas?). However, you can guess what happens and really do it: Radzoff comes out and goes after the children who have disturbed his peace. Once again, the formula is trivial and abused. The acting is mostly anemic, and the direction is so ridiculous. But Mayne gives a good performance in a sea of ​​ineptitude. Definitely worth a peek. Watching Mayne continue to appear on the screens of her mausoleum, she always wore an ironic smile on my lips.
