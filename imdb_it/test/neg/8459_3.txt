Useless and rather stupid film that is basically a collection of clips of horror films, science fiction and suspense. There are unnecessary hits for an audience watching the clips and Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen are among the audience members who turn to the camera and explain why we love horror movies. It's not a bad idea, but all the explanations are obvious ("the horror film helps us face the real horror", "you're at the mercy of the director in a theater") and rather trivial. The clips are also shown very quickly and the changes are strident. And, shown out of context, these bits are not scary at all. And it's very short - I saw it in a theater in 1984 and I was indignant at paying $ 5.00 for an 84-minute movie! <br /> <br /> However, he is reasonably well looked after and Allen and Pleasance seem to be enjoying themselves. For people who have an interest in learning more about terror, this could be fun and interesting. But if you're a horror fan (like me) you'll probably get bored. Good idea, bad execution (no pun intended). I give him a 3.
