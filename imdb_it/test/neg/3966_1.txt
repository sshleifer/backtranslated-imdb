For those of you who have few kind words for this movie, I suspect you didn't see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror". <br /> <br /> It was a terribly boring film. He missed the mark in at least three ways. It wasn't good enough to be scary; it wasn't bad enough to be funny (although MST3K took care of that); and, even in 1979, the plot was not original. <br /> <br /> The previous contenders are "The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The film is fun and has had a refined cast. Another is "Dormiente" (1973). Yes, the Woody Allen movie. Remember the flattened nose? And "Cloni" (1973). The last two lots are not similar to Clonus as the first, but precede Clonus. <br /> <br /> They are also several fiction books from decades before that deal with the idea, although often, the word "clone" is not used.
