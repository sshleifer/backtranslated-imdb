I was looking forward to this movie. Actors worthy of trust, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? If you are about to attempt something that is meant to encapsulate the meaning of life. First. I know. OK, I didn't expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought they could offer crumbs to peck and treat to add fuel to the fire - Che! they almost did. Things I haven't had A woman wandering alone in dark places and lonely parking lots, unaware of the consequences. Big riddles that fell on the roadside. The promise of knowledge contained therein by the so-called original criminal. I had no budget problems and enjoyed the suspense. I understood and I can give lyrics to the madman and I found the role of Adrian Pauls crucial and penetrating and then ????? Basically the plot and the script were good up to a point and that was the last 10 minutes or so. What? Run out of ideas! It is a pity that this film had to disappoint us so much. It may not understand the meaning and I didn't really expect the writers to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual, ride, and I had an accident in the street
