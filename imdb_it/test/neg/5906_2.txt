He was praised for being a fast-paced comedy and the best German film of the year, so I made an attempt, even though I've already seen some Dani Levy films - or at least parts of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy, unless you think heart attacks are fun. It is a fine example of sloppy writing, with an implausible plot and characters, full of clichés that could be true, but certainly not even fun. <br /> <br /> The most annoying character is that of Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. He must behave incredibly odd to keep the plot moving. For example: she does not know a single thing about Judaism, but for reasons most likely unknown to herself she has the idea of ​​doing the charade that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey the Jews for her husband's family, which I really am, and of the very orthodox and hypocritical variety. To make it a little more complicated, he invites the four to stay in his apartment in the city, because they arrive from Frankfurt to Berlin without having booked their hotels in advance, something not a 60-year-old businessman, in reality not a adult German would ever do. This gives the viewer much to swallow, but still fails to produce jokes. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel haven't seen each other in forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now an orthodox militant - were once lovers and he is the father of the daughter. Samuel's daughter, a nymphomaniac, chases Zucker's gay son. Should this be somehow a funny parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? It's probably just a thoughtless way to add some "turbulent love action" to which every fuck comedy needs. And of course he can't even make jokes. <br /> <br /> The praise of this film is purely political. So only people who like to watch movies that should be "politically important" will appreciate this, even if "Alles auf Zucker!" clearly it has no importance whatsoever. <br /> <br /> For everything else: don't look at it without a "Fast Forward" option. I really missed it.
