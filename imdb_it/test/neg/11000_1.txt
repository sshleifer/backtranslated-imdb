This is one of the most stupid and useless films ever. It does not actually qualify for the status of the films. It is VERY cheap (apparently filmed on videotape), attacked horribly and simply rotten. I couldn't believe how cheap and inept this piece of shit was. It looked like a home video! I mean, I think a guy I know a little about houses must have dug his camera and made this crap in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. Did I notice the name it came from? Asylum ?? and I will NEVER rent anything with that name on it !!! When you rent a movie, check if it comes from this "company". One thing is true though - if you like horribly played amateur movies, then you might like this loser. It is absolutely boring and terrible !!! You have been warned !!!
