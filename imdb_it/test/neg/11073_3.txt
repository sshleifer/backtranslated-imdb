If it is true that the film costs only 150K, it explains a lot. But it doesn't explain why it doesn't have a real plot. In the middle of the film I didn't care if they made it or not. I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The ending was really stupid and made me wish I would have just turned off the film and gone to bed early. Pretty good interpretation considering there wasn't much to do. If you like really bad movies with horrible lighting (even for a cave) and a bad photographic work (even for a cave) ... then you will like this movie very much. By the way, if the boy's plane crashed in 1980 when he was about 10 or so, how could he have forgotten how to talk and built so much anger? Would he not want help from the first people he had seen even if it was 14 years later?
