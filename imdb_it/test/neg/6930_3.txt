This film should relate to the frustrations of making films. He definitely frustrated me with his endless boredom. The setting is an attractive Spanish seaside resort with its usual big cast. The script is written very badly or maybe there was no script. A film far superior to the frustrations of cinema is Francois Truffaut's "Day For Night", released in 1973. It shows all the delays and how the cast can behave badly in an intriguing manner. It does not bore the viewer and gains understanding for the director who must somehow complete the film.
