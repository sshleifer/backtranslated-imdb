Based on David Ignatius' 2007 espionage novel, Body of Lies tells the story of a CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) who is sent to Jordan to track down a mind of Al-Qaeda, while trampling a tight tight loyalty to his The Jordanian hosts and his manipulative American boss Ed Hoffman (Crowe). <br /> <br /> Anyone who has seen the trailers could be forgiven for thinking that the story revolves around the double agent action and the betrayal of Hoffman's Ferris, but the current story is much more banal. Instead we are served a warm broth of ridiculous subterfuge as the handsome white American guy Ferris moves with virtual impunity through the bustling streets of Amman Jordan with a worried look on his shoulders or the attraction of the attention of the locals. Only during a scene in which Ferris takes his new Iranian love for tea, the reality is intruded as the couple is bombarded by flashes from Jordanian men. <br /> <br /> Compounding the problems of the film are twists that seem designed like nothing more than padding. Ferris flies to Jordan, Ferris is expelled from Jordan, Ferris flies to Washington, Ferris flies to the UK, Ferris flies to Jordan, Hoffman flies to Jordan, Hoffman returns home to take care of his children ?? a come and go. This is the kind of thing you'd expect to see in an episode of The Amazing Race, not a spy thriller. <br /> <br /> In his punitive loyalty to his trade, Crowe earned 63 pounds of flab for portly Ed Hoffman, joining the small club of actors composed by Robert De Niro and Christian Bale as actors who have undergone a massive weight gain or loss to their roles. Too bad all the other participants did not share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, because if they did, we would have a much better film in our hands than this sub-par mess.
