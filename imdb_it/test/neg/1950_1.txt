I had noticed that this film had been on Cinemax very recently, so this morning I decided to watch it. I had just finished the Infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought this was nice too. From the description the cable had, at least. This film was terrible. It's slow, the pace is horrible, it seems to last 4 hours. There is no real plot to talk about ... Agh! How can you say something good about this film. Rickman is good ... but he always is ... the other two characters work well, but there is no real story to support any of these. After 2 hours, and you sitting there wondering what the hell is going on, where on earth there is the tram - ends with a surprise that frankly only made me sick. Do not worry about it.
