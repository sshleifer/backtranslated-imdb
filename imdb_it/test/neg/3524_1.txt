What can I say? This was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, some of my favorite movies are certainly horrible). The acting was amateurish, the sets were boring and the work with the camera was poor and sophisticated. The whole film looked like a final college project. I had to keep convincing myself that it was done by a teenager to make it look a little good. The most disturbing factor of the "film" is that it is not even a film - it is shot on video. He was extremely distracting. Besides all this, the dialogue is simply disastrous and the plot is so simple that it makes your eyes water. Not to mention the fact that they steal from at least four other horror films in the first 20 minutes or so. If there was something like zero star, this movie would understand. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's scary about this movie is how ugly it is.
