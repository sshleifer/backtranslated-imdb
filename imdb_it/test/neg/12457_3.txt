"Tart" is a pathetic attempt to make films that wander around and among a group of Manhattan teenagers who explore all the usual pre-teen things ... sex, drugs and classical music almost completely devoid of history, focus or purpose . Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes while Swain works diligently through another in his long list of dog movies. Nothing in this film works and Wayne should consider getting a real job. Not recommended for anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
