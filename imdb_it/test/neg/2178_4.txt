* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this aspiring satire, Chaplin has set his sights on the evils of German fascism, playing the twin roles of the Tomanian dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an involuntary First World War Jewish hero and barber. Through events inspired by both Adolf Hitler and the Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates contracts and declares war on nearby Osterlich, finding time for numerous oddly flat sets of pieces. The famous dictator's waltz with an inflatable globe is actually quite heavy, overwhelming and not very fun. <br /> <br /> Chaplin should be praised for looking at the Hitler lampoon and for having spoken forcefully on celluloid - his much-maligned final speech is actually the strong and memorable point of the piece - but the film simply does not he is neither sharp nor amusing enough to deserve the praise often gathered about it, nor to require repeated visions. The best gags are far from the annoying posture of Hynkel and involve The Barber in an attempt to avoid a large rotating bomb (a sequence that steals from the brawl of the gun in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, which accidentally moves away the board from the roof of his shop. <br /> <br /> Compared to the silent classics of the director, The Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent and completely unsatisfactory, while the uncertain intervals between laughter are often long and difficult to bear. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but even genes make disappointing photos and the Great Dictator is certainly the best.
