Yup! this movie has been hurt in every way in things like cast, effects, boredom, excitement and of course being fantastic and we know all four heroes in this have been a little more colorful than the new ones, but it has yet to go, A fantastic boredom like this was just a stupid junk that I knew no one would want when I saw it, I mean definitely with that budget on 3 or 4 GOOD movies could have been made but no. I'm glad the new version of this year showed everyone how the fantastic four with a good story, a very talented cast like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses would have been made otherwise it would have been completely forgotten, but fortunately no. The new one was excellent when I saw it with my friends at the cinema, but this old nuisance has to go.
