Lina McLaidlaw is a bright and lonely young woman who suddenly falls in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor with a weakness for losing money. They get married, but almost immediately Lina is subjected to Johnnie's addiction to lying, gambling and debt. Despite his faults, he is unable to resist his fascinating manner, until he begins to suspect that he may harbor murderous thoughts about him ... <br /> <br /> This is a good film, well done, with an attractive cast, a good script and perhaps the single most delicious final in the history of cinema. Ok, maybe it's going too far, but not by much. Many films change the end of a book (Great Expectations, The Shining, etc.). But the last two scenes of this not only manage to be horribly lame, but they also make the entire previous plot completely meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral lack - and what he knows about him - to kill her. It should end (as it does in the book by Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley Before The Fact) with its attempt to kill it. The reason it is not that the study forced Hitch to resume the ending, one of the first examples of the preview audience test preview process. Hitch was astute and did what he was told (it was only his third Hollywood movie) knowing that if he played, sooner or later he would get creative control of his films, demonstrated by his fifties masterpieces. But this still leaves us with a turkey of a finish. This is a real shame because it is really a good movie with an intriguing theme - does anyone really know their husband or wife? The script is excellent, with many off-guard moments (such as when Lina's father dies and Johnnie assumes he is crying for it), a finely judged performance by Grant (who has never played a villain) and fine photography in all , culminating in the famous shot of glass of milk. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although personally I prefer his confusion and vulnerability in his previous role as wife victim in Rebecca. I'd like to evaluate this film higher, but I can't really forgive this ending; this is what happens when the films are made for money, not for love, which I imagine is curiously the theme of the film itself. Look quickly for Hitchcock's cameo as a man who publishes a letter.
