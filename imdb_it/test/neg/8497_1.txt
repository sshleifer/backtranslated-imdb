This movie has made you crazy. I think the original of this film, "The Mask", was a fantastic film, which is worth buying and watching a lot. I strongly believed that they should have made a sequel, but when I saw it, I thought better of it. <br /> <br /> This film spoiled the whole idea of ​​"The Mask". Mask mode? A child flying in a room? My little brother, who is seven, did not even laugh, and it is in these childish films, but this was worse. A load of shit !! I'm telling you now, please don't watch this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead you could really enjoy yourself! Look at 'The Mask', but don't do it, I repeat NOT, look at this piece of garbage. Thank you.
