STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans cop Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme ) is reassigned to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico to help the police there with their efforts to stop a heroin smuggling operation in their city. The culprits turn out to be former soldiers, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase of East Enders) who is using a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has a more personal reason to bring him down, which draws the two men into an explosive final showdown where only one will leave alive. <br /> <br /> After Until Death, Van Damme appeared at the top, proving he could get the best out of video movies in the action market. While that was a much more drama-oriented film, with The Shepherd he returned to high-football, no brain action that made him famous for the first time and unfortunately produced his worst Derailed film. It's not even as bad as that movie, but what I said is still valid. <br /> <br /> A boring and predictable film, with very few exciting actions. What's more is some loose fight scenes, which try to look fashionable and trendy with some low-cost slo-mo / accelerated effects added to them that, unfortunately, make them seem more desperate. Being a film set in Mexico, the director Isaac Florentine tried to give the film a sensation of Robert Rodriguez / Desperado, but this only adds to the desperation. <br /> <br /> VD offers a particularly uninspired performance and since he's never been an actor of Robert De Niro, who can't be good. Like the villain, Lord shouldn't expect to leave the beeb anytime soon. At first he has few dialogues as he struggles to pick up an American accent but becomes mysteriously better towards the end. All supporting casts are equally insignificant, and do nothing to lift the spirits of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a pastor who is directly diverted from the flock. *
