This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is not a shred of historical precision, in fact the reality is inverted. Just one example: Morgan preached the few ethnic Chinese he met. The acting is exaggerated, the script is a badly written lie. I've never seen the worst fake beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and was said to have made the film only if the script was completely rewritten to be a hero. Since the script was composed of ten on the fly, it could explain how bad the film is and how disjointed it is. <br /> <br /> Any film about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
