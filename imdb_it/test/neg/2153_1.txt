Experienced actors in this know how to behave and have demonstrated it before, but the director, who also wrote and produced this parody, is incompetent on so many levels. OK. it's a low budget, but I know film students with lower budgets and lesser-known actors who can do much, much better. For example, since there were people involved who should have known better, some of the guns were totally out of place and never existed in those days. The work of the stunts was awkward: the stale and hokey story. If someone gives you a copy of this use for a coaster. Anyway, I love westerns and I met many stuntmen and I even went to high school with one of the actors, so I was looking for it to be good.
