I'm sure any legitimate submarine would happily be shipped to the USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...) Because, you could play all-out basketball in the torpedo room, it's so big. And speaking of the bow windows, is it better to see the giant squid or minefields that appear from nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess-cook with the parrot on his shoulder? And the admiral's cabin with what appears to be a loft? Big bleeping sub ... <br /> <br /> OK, OK ... will never win any prize for authenticity. And if the diver is ridiculous, the plot is even worse. Somehow the Van Allen bands of radiation, hundreds of miles in space, have "caught fire", making global warming look like a pan. The pompous admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon), together with his assistant Lucius (Peter Lorre, who seems appropriately uncomfortable) hatch a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile at his side. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a reborn survivor (and even his little dog!) two "ladies" who can never leave well enough alone, a passel of "red shirts" that are expendable, and plot holes large enough for Godzilla to cross. Thrill to the Seaview is chased by what seems like 60 miles an hour from another diver - there's no need for advanced sonar when you can follow from 100 feet aft. <br /> <br /> The film goes from one cliff-hanger to another; the payoff is so anticlimatic that it is useless, certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait. <br /> <br /> The technical consultant for this shipwreck must have been a 14-year-old boy with a stack of Popular Mechanics magazines. Worth a look, if only for riff on.
