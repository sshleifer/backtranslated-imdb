I always rate films on this site, but normally I don't write comments. However, in this case, I felt obliged to WARN OTHERS! This movie is bad! It is probably one of the few tens of films that I have marked as "1 (horrible)". I know people always say that, but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is easily on the bottom ten, however. <br /> <br /> When it comes to horror movies, I have very low standards. I will neglect all sorts of bad films for a good fright. But this film is embarrassingly bad. It looks like someone bought a Sears camera and decided to make a movie with his friends. (The fact that the name of every single crew member appears on the cast list demonstrates this theory, I think.) This film has lower production standards than the normal high school game. It's actually a bit shocking to see a movie that looks so badly posted on DVD. The special effects are quite effective sometimes, but at best they are still amateur. The best thing that can be said about the actors is that they at least remember not to look into the camera most of the time. I can't say for sure if they struggle to remember their lines or to invent them as they go along. All attempts at humor are lame. This film is a colossal waste of time.
