I'm willing to tolerate almost anything in a science fiction movie, but this was almost intolerable. While some of the special effects are very interesting (landscapes) this is not a "battle space", rather a strange mother / daughter relationship with science fiction concepts. Acting (in wood), framing and shooting (kindergarten) and with the funniest "melee" fight scenes of any Chopsocky Hong Kong movie, this movie bores. The plot is complicated and the tools used to move the plot along (narrator), inexplicable leaps and lots of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that the cum director writer is not a good idea. Save your love of science fiction for something else instead of losing some of this here.
