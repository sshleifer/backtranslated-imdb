I was encouraged to watch this movie because I heard about it well: it had to be this electrifying crime milestone, disturbing, shocking ... all that jazz. Well, I'm disturbed because I spent money on it, and I'm shocked that something so terrible has been released. It's all here. <br /> <br /> It is an alleged "new look" of the loser-drugged crazy family of Charles Manson and their murders. But if this is a "new look" then it is probably "new" as in "fresh and totally inept": just looking at it gave me a headache and I had to give up trying to figure it out or even understand what the director was he wanted it to be. <br /> <br /> I suppose I should say something about the plot, but the fact is that it was so stupid and inconsistent that I barely remember if there was even a plot. There was something about a "Manson tape" given to a radio DJ (or TV producer?), Then an hour of useless random sequences of "the family" in '69, then the Polanski murders (sounds like a bad joke scholasticism) and finally an idiotic part about a group of skinheads who get drunk and fight each other in an alley (I'm not kidding), and then it's finished (thank God) (Don't ask me to make sense of that, I'm just remembering what I saw!) The performances were terrible too. And how hard is it to make a convincing "Manson"? Take a small skinny little boy, put a dirty wig and a shaggy beard on him. Your Manson is there. But this "Manson" doesn't even seem right. He just looks, uh, a guy with a cheap wig and a stuck-up Santa Claus beard painted black. Or maybe that's what this movie really talks about: Manson's family didn't make sense, so this movie doesn't make any sense either. It's symbolic! (Yes, right) I am still so angry at spending money for this I stopped my normal lurking on this site and only registered to vote 1 for this movie and post this warning that hopefully could prevent others from spending their money on this garbage. Stay away from me, it's not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> PS. The recent American television production "Helter Skelter" got negative reviews, but I saw it last month (I also saw the original 1976) and let me say that, compared to "Manson Family", that new Helter Skelter is BRILLIANT and FLAWLESS. And I was disappointed! This is how the "Manson family" is very bad: it makes an imperfect and mostly disappointing TV movie perfect.
