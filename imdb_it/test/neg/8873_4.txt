The actors are so insignificant that it is almost impossible to distinguish them (Pauline Kael said of this film: "The actors have names, but they are really anonymous"), and the special effects are really bad. They simulate weightlessness with people hanging from cables and recycling the trick that allows Fred Astaire to dance on the ceiling in "Royal Wedding" (but none of these guys move well enough to make it look convincing). <br /> <br /> The weak point of the film is when one of the characters, an airplane magnate, is trying to convince other "industry giants" to come with him to a consortium of lunar rockets, and he shows them a Woody Woodpecker comic explaining how a rocket works at a 2nd level level! (And to think that Robert Heinlein worked on the script ...) <br /> <br /> The only advantage is that the design of the production manages to communicate a sort of "Amazing Stories" feeling, and this too is done a lot better in the next film by the producer (George Pal) "When Worlds Collide", which has a similar bad acting, but is much more fun. However, Pal's best science fiction film must be "The Time Machine".
