"Shuttle" is an indie thriller about four young adults taking a late-night ride on an airport shuttle to find out that the driver is a sadistic psychopath. <br /> <br /> Although some of the sequences of scares and is an interesting unconventional plot work, some aspects just not. Bad dialogue and unlikely characters give a good reason not to care. But often the suspense works and asks you the question "What would you do?" and usually what YOU DO is not what these idiots do on the shuttle. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting a senseless and bloody horror movie, you'll be wrong. This is a movie that makes you use your mind, but unfortunately, not until the end. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten.
