When one considers that Carson McCullers is one of the most important literary figures of the twentieth century, he seems to need a great lack of talent to be able to ruin one of his stories, but this film shows that it can be done! How do actors please their way of becoming directors? Wooden, unnatural, obnoxious, totally out of sync with the poetic compassion of McCullers' writing, my mouth dropped from the horror and disbelief that such a movie mash-mash could ever find funding and backers. The only positive features are a moderately good acting, (although that being said, Vanessa Redgrave seems to consistently make the same performance whatever the character she plays), and some good cinematography in places, but otherwise it is a bitter and bitter disappointment, and could, indeed should, have been a contemporary masterpiece. Simon Callow should lower his head in shame and stick to acting!
