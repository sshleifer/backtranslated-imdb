Sometimes I wonder if today's horror movies are based on human torture to scare people. If so, then there is a sad future for horror films. Dee Snyder tries to make you feel scared and terrified, this movie does exactly that but not in a positive sense. Now there are some moments in the movie where there is a chance that Snyder is saving this movie from the hole in a hole but let's be honest, this movie didn't fall into a hole, it was already in a hole and Synder doesn't make anything happen to get out of it. When you finish watching this movie, you're sick, depressed, dirty and crazy. I have the feeling that this was the intention of this film. What's lower than dirt?
