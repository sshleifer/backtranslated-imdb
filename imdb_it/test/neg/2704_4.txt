Although this film is overall inaccurate, there are some elements that can be true. Certainly, he was a character unleashed in his youth, having played pranks on his fellow cadets at West Point, almost expelled several times, graduating last in his class (34 years), and often reckless in his leadership during the Civil War. br /> <br /> But the story may have made him a scapegoat for Indian wars. Of course, he did his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? Furthermore, there is evidence that he testified before Congress (at great risk to his commission and command) that he discussed whether to break treaties with the Indians and that if he were Indian he would have fought rather than live on a reservation! <br /> <br /> As a character said in the 1776 drama when asked what he will say about the British about the loss of the Revolutionary War, the character claims that "history will do what it always does ... it will lie". Who knows how bad a Custer man was. Certainly he was not the nice character played by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt that he was completely wicked as he is later portrayed.
