this is a horrible movie. has passed mute. Firstly, the only thing the twins are interested in is their appearance and what boys like. I'm in first grade. not to mention I'm a prostitute or something, but it sends the wrong message to girls of all ages. being nice and popular is not everything. but this is what the twins have discovered. The plot is even worse. the girl's grandfather is the ambassador (sp?) in France. He has a colleague who accompanies the girls in Paris and meets two "cute French boys" with motorcycles. meet to meet the guys who really start to like ETC ..... meet a supermodel in the works and go around with foreign relatives who they think are cute. do i need to say more? this movie could be nice for 8 and 9 years old. twins play losing voice actors who want boyfriends. makes the wrong idea to girls. even the film is not exceptional. I do not recommend it to anyone I give the passport to Paris 2/10
