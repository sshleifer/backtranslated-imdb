This film is just as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I am not referring to acting, but rather to the premise of both films, which try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic figures. It also disturbs me when respected and respected actors like Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play these roles, because their status tends to give credibility to the director's intention to elevate the subject of the film, an outcast of society. <br /> <br /> I was in high school in the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his appeals for the death penalty and the books were very much in vogue. I remember that the main opinion was that the death penalty was wrong and that Chessman was the victim. <br /> <br /> Get some people. Read the story. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. He drove through the streets of Los Angeles at night with a stolen police light in his vehicle. He stopped the cars with attractive women inside on the charge of making a traffic stop; then abducted and raped women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience and many victims say they would prefer death for her horror and humiliation. <br /> <br /> Chessman got exactly what he deserved, it took a decade too long. No sympathy for the devil here.
