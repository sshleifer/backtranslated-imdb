Quite terrible, but not entirely unwatchable. Another review mentioned "predictable" - and this is almost an understatement. You can make a game to guess what the next line will be. Each character is stereotypical or archetypal. The good guy in a bad situation, the struggle between old and young priests for acceptance and discipline, the repressed, sexually / emotionally deprived woman who returns to the small town after failing in the big city, engaged to her boyfriend's hot and weak youth , the irreducible villains, two "lost boys" who seek a sense of family - they are all here, and none of them with even the most remote rotation of something new. From the first minutes you can understand exactly what will happen at the end of the film. The story is not completely lame, but the direction, the acting (even from a cast with some talent) everything is thrown together without skill. As for the plot, we've already seen it in a movie called "Sister Act". This is also one of those films in which inattention to small details manifests itself in an even more dazzling light. (For example: the nurse and our hero drive into the city but park several blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - but both pass through empty parking lots for no apparent reason, or the transition from morning to night during a scene what seems to be happening in no more than half an hour.The film is full of that kind of things and then the labels on an unlikely epilogue.
