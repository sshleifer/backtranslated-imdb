Once again, director J. Lee Thompson joins actress Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action film. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal film (a real feat for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). However, brutality is not alone for a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you had to take away his brutality, the film would have a precious little interest. <br /> <br /> The story is about a retired hit man (Bronson) who lives a welcoming life on a Caribbean island. He is convinced to come out of retirement to track down and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who is doing his vile trade around various holes in the South American hell. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we take care of some graphic torture scenes to show us what a bad job it was. <br /> <br /> These themes are actually quite serious. Torture continues in suppressive dictatorships in Latin America, and ordinary people are forced to suffer some rudely painful experiences simply to express an unpopular point of view. But the evil that men do - as much as he deserves, is not very worried about the plight of these poor people. He is only annoyed by giving Charles Bronson an excuse to wipe out some unpleasant plastic bags. It's just an exploitative activist who blocks his coat on real issues. The torture sequences make you feel spectator like a dirty and sick voyeur, rather like someone who enjoys watching "snuff" movies. The script is full of horrible dialogues, including some excessive descriptions of acts of torture. The Evil That Men Do can't explore his disturbing ideas ... he serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but it's wrong.
