Connery boarded the fool Moore in this foul movie. Launching everything that made Bond winning in the first place, this film further degrades the character of Bond, throwing him into the category of Inspector Gadget. Become smart this is not. There is no style here, only second-rate actors perform on low-cost sets. It is a pity that Connery did not lend an element of class here, but he does not find it. Everything here smells of mediocrity, including Connery's bad toupee. Perhaps if I had been snowed and had had the chance to choose between "Never Say Never Again" and "Howard The Duck" I would choose the first one. If you want the real James Bond, take any Ian Flemming novel.
