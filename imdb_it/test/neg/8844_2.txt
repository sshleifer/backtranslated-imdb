I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper. Sometimes I can get into intellectual romantic movies. This film did not touch me. It seemed to me that it was about an hour too long. Camille is interpreted as a very nice sculptor who loses almost everything. I thought the whole movie was just sad and downcast. If you like tragedies, you CAN be so. I thought it was too long, which means that it has many useless scenes, which eventually lead to about an hour of boredom. I would not recommend this movie. If you want to see a beautiful romantic tragedy go and watch Titanic.
