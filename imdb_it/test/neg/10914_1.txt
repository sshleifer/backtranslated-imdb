<br /> <br /> Friend, I can't believe this movie. I saw it all (believe me, I did it!) And the best part was the trailer at the beginning (and I hate the traillers !!!!). <br /> <br /> No plot, no acting, no nothing. I was watching the movie and thought, "When will it start"? It never started. How can people spend money and time to make such crap? <br /> <br /> The "plot": A dog is bitten by a bat and gets angry - Ok, so far no problem, nothing special but OK. Now the rest of the film will be - the Dog will chase people !!! that's all, nothing else !!! Now add some of the worst actors / actors I've ever seen, some completely unrealistic scenes (and some others really idiotic, like the baby can't breathe and the mother gives him a big, strong hug to see if he's better), very lame ending, here you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and create something more worthy, like hitting your head against the wall or playing chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> ZERO out of 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
