My Name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... For seeing this. <br /> <br /> This is something else. First of all, how is it rated so high? I can't understand it. This "show" is full to the top with annoying people, stupid or simply unlikely people. The "gags" are horrible. <br /> <br /> I saw an episode in which Earl's brother's wife wrapped herself and washed herself with dead fish. I'm not kidding. It wasn't funny, it's repulsive. Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother (and I mean stupid) had sex. I almost vomited. <br /> <br /> This must be one of the desperate attempts at comedy for a long time. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible "comedy". Earl is now in prison for this current season. We hope you get the chair just so this show is put out of its misery. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: This show would be fun for people who think the guy from Larry the Cable is funny. To the rest of the world, NOT A CHANCE. Avoid like the plague.
