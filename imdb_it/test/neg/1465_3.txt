I found it on the shelf and fainted with joy !! I danced up to the counter, slapped my money and ran home! You know what?! I fell asleep less than half way through! I tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the hell !?!! I couldn't watch it! I love all the other things he did (I haven't seen the one with the monster in it yet). What does it give? It's me? Or he? So sad. Boo hoo. P.S, I liked the camera.
