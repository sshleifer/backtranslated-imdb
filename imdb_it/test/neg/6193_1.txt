let me first say that I was a big Carlin fan in the past. I think George is one of the smartest people and the best comedians on the planet. what made George so exceptional in the past was his ability to look at things in his twisted way and give us his unique perspective on those things. It wasn't always fun, but you always respected his opinions, because they were so cleverly presented. but you're all sick it's just a long rant. does not give us any unique perspective on anything, it just gives us a long list of things that he is p.o. to. there is no intuition, no intelligence, only an old man who complains for an hour about things we all complained about. and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. you are all sick calls to stupid people who cannot handle anything more advanced than something simple and direct. I don't mind that the anger fueled the play, but George could have done a lot better. I really hope that George Carlin's next show is up to the quality that George has shown in the past.
