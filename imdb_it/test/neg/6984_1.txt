At the opposite end of the spectrum from RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK is the absolutely inferior adventure of David Hemmings on the rescue of a plane from the World War II era with a precious cargo. The assets include the beautiful settings in New Zealand, the energetic musical score of Brian May and some dandy helicopter flying and jet boat pursuits. Evil, however, far exceeds good. Donald Pleasence hams as perhaps never before; half of his dialogue is almost unintelligible. George Peppard attempts an Australian accent (I think), then abandons it halfway. Lesley Ann Warren is more irritating. Ken Wahl is, well, Ken Wahl. The dialogue is painful to listen to and Hemmings' direction is largely inept. The script is not only obvious but terrible. The beats fall flat, the scenes carry no punch and the continuity is practically non-existent. According to the credits, two men were killed by piloting jet boats during the making of the film. What a waste.
