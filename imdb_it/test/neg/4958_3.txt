I've seen many horror movies, splatters and monsters in my life. And of course also many monster films from the 50s and 60s. When for the first time I came across this I thought it was from the 60s until I recognized that it is from 2007. <br /> <br /> Actually the character of Jack Brook is interesting and the acting is a good splatter movie, but .... I was expecting a splatter movie and not a dramatic story about an aggressive roll. The film lasts 80 minutes and I think the first kill is after 65 minutes. Even if it takes hours to explain the story, the reason why the monsters come from at least 3 minutes ... we have another boring 20 minute dialogue and finally, in my opinion, not a well managed splatter sequence. Although we have Robert Englund starring here, I recommend it only to true hardcore horror fans.
