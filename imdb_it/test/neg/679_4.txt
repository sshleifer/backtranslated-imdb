Tamara Anderson and her family are moving once again, as her traveling painter father pursues his next landscape. Fifteen years, it is in its rebel stage. Already angry with her father for the frequent travels, her anger gets worse when her mother is suddenly forced into a tuberculosis sanatorium. The absence of her mother leads Tamara to hurl herself against her father and seek comfort in religion, the boy next door, Rusty, as well as the spirit of the dead teenager who lived in his rented house. <br /> <br /> History is modest because of fault. It is strangely stimulated, and even during its emotional scenes there is no tension. The actors that portray parents are doing well. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic like her sick mother, and Maria Ricossa is particularly effective as the mother affected by the guilt of the dead teenager. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateurish to wear the film. The dialogue is very natural and Boland can't get it out. She has her moments and when she hits them she can be good but there have been too many times she has gotten embarrassed. You see that he thinks 'ok this is what my line is and this is the face I should do' rather than react to the other actors. Not the only one, Kevin Zegers in the role of Rusty and Megan Park, as his sister Brenda also suffers from a sting, but at least they are in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done right, the script could have made it a striking film. And it has moments but a lot of it is bogged down with a performance of amateur lead and a flat direction.
