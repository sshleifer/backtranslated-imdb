First let me tell you that those of you who voted "10" are just kidding and trying to get the votes to a respectable level ... something that this movie doesn't deserve. (The only films that deserve a 10 IMO are the classics ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. Check out the top rated movies of all time for the complete list.) I also noticed that many people gave this positive vote to be like this realistic for what it is like inside a cave. Even if I should agree with them in the neighborhood, they simply don't classify the film as a whole ... they are infatuated with the surrounding environment but lack the overall review. It would be as if I were voting for a 10 for the movie "From Justin to Kelly" because I think the beach scenes remind me of what it is like in the Florida Keys ... although it may be true, the 10 doesn't deserve the movie because the movie as a whole it was rancid. <br /> <br /> I wish I could tell you that something has saved this film, as usually if something stinks in a horror movie, something else picks up or compensates for weakness. (Ex. - Bad actors are overshadowed by a fantastic plot and / or a great photographic and scenographic work). We started the DVD and it all started quite normally. We jokingly started to choose who would be the first to die ... after a short period of driving and trekking, they set up the camp for the night. At that moment, I typed in a few things that really made me understand the rest of the film. Two main problems I had: negative effects and an even worse plot. The first thing we all noticed is that the campfires weren't real ... you can clearly see the "cgi" or false flames on which they were all sitting. For a horror movie, having such a blatant flaw should have told me what to expect for the next hour. <br /> <br /> Only a few minutes later, I was shown how badly this film was written. I don't remember exactly how they got to the point, but basically, we find out that the "token Nerd" is writing a book on cave exploration, etc. Another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience, but hesitates stating "I don't want this story in your book". The author convinces and convinces the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him. (A direct quotation: "If I tell you the story, you would certainly want it in your book.") At this point, I was expecting a beautiful story of over 5 minutes, complete with flashback and heartfelt acting. What I got was a short, ill-said (and recited) statement. I say affirmation because what he said was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don't remember the exact quotation marks, but basically he says: "We were in a cave, the cave was flooded, a girl died while our friend watched her drown". You may think you are exaggerating and being really critical, but it is not far from a direct quotation, a line by line, from the movie scene. <br /> <br /> In the next 50 minutes or so, the film takes place in the cave and even if the lighting is what I imagine to be like in a cave, I could really do without the blurred / blurred appearance of the movie, and the shaking camera is just one that I didn't go for. (I have a really good vision, and after seeing the main parts of the film, I felt legally blind.) I was emotionally detached from this film, so the parts that probably should have been scary were not. Perhaps if I had been able to neglect the very slow and misinterpreted beginning of this film, I would at least have been scared, but I don't remember anyone in the dark room getting upset in any of the "action" scenes. /> <br /> The last scene was probably one I will never forget, and this is not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped in a bare room. The "monster" enters to attack / kill women ... is stopped when he sees a picture of a boy. A flashback occurs when we discover that the "monster" was wounded as a boy and spent his whole life in the cave. Reduce to the present time and take his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a buckskin shirt). Take a look at the photo and the two women seem to have found the weakness / weakness of the caveman. At that point, he stabs and kills a girl, then proceeds to rape the other woman, rather graphically. After about 30 seconds of watching the camera vibrate and shake while raping it, pulling the credits, the film is finished. <br /> <br /> Honestly, if I had to do it all over again and wasted money renting this movie, I could have saved an hour and watched the first scene and the last scene of this movie and stayed with the same thoughts I have now. <br /> <br /> How many of you compare this to Blair Witch are very out ... if any of you had read about how the director and writer would direct the filming of Blair he would have realized how revolutionary he was. .. giving each cast member a script the day / night of the shoot without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If IMDb had left me, it would have gotten a negative score ... I don't understand how someone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
