What's the point? Has it never been done before, better? It is again? Why is Werner Herzog wasting his talents and time with junk like this? Shouldn't shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? <br /> <br /> Everything seemed fake from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never have tried to make a film about the myth of Loch Ness - at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers - so the plot was not credible from the start. The actors who should act as if they were not acting were obviously acting. The story was not interesting, the "ordinary people" required in each mockumentary were invisible, the personalities were stale, the jokes were not funny, the effects were not convincing and the ending was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> I don't understand the point. It's a fake movie on a fake movie. Hah, hah. Perhaps if those who invented such a film tried to create one that mocked the people who were really looking for a real Nessie, now they could have potential. But Herzog is not a believer and never claimed to be one. A mockumentary on the cryptozoic crowd would have had much more fuel. <br /> <br /> It was a lack.
