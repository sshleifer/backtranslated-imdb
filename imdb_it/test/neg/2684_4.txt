Scott's 1980s icon collection can't save this youth disaster. But I suppose that's why it was just a TV movie and not an important movie. William A. Schwartz (scriptwriter) approaches something closer to "Stewardess School", except that this film is more boring. This film is not really stupid, just boring and completely devoid of plot. The only reason to see this could be to see Tina Yothers in a real role after family ties. After this film and equally stupid "Class Cruise", I imagine that Mr. Scott made a move and went back to directing sitcoms, which was his best move. 4 out of 10
