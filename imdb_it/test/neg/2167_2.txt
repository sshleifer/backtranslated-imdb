"Tales from the Crapper" is gory, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, intellectual and scatological. But that's okay, I was prepared for everything I had experienced in my previous Troma experiences. What I WAS NOT prepared for is that it is also boring, unpleasant, and boring. Very little of the genuine anarchist spirit of films like "Class of Nuke'em High" has remained intact; in its place, we receive ENDLESS playful jokes (to the point where you start to wonder if Lloyd Kaufman is becoming senile, thinking that adults find the strong fart so damn funny!) and a cynical and shameless exploitation of the viewer, who is essentially investing time and money to see a "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to know should never have been released in the first place. Oh yes, there is a lot of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn movie probably offers a better storyline, higher production values, more humorous humor and, above all, more RESPECT for its expected viewer than this atrocity. . <br /> <br /> P.S: Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (the blonde lesbian student in the "How to make your movie" segment) is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
