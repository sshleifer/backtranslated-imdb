Gruesome masks and slasher movies went together like cheese and chives throughout the long cycle. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who started the trend, but like many of the clich√©s of the genre, the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of a hooded maniac in a murder. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween cutting boards that deserve a mention. The Classroom massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend are clearly pre-dated to 1978, while Dreaded Sundown's The Town is considered one of the first films for teenagers. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film may not have been the real masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competition between filmmakers to unravel the most spooky disguise for their bogeymen. Over the years we've seen some memorable contenders, but my favorites should be: the My Bloody Valentine freak miner, The Prowler sadistic soldier and the copper-faced killer of Wicked Games. I am also passionate about many of the killer clowns who made an appearance in the whole category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row must be listed among the best and The Clown of Midnight also ranks among the greatest costumes of the mad. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type used in a slasher film, probably because they are largely related to sexual perversion, which obviously isn't exactly a fear disguise. But in the following years both the Blackout and this darkness decided that fear could certainly be incorporated with a complete gin. Here's how the second of the two went ?? <br /> <br /> The screen turns on with the discharge of blue sirens, while the cops run towards the scene of a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed gentleman has had enough of being chosen as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so he decided to keep his wife and child under the threat of a gun. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight with the gunman, but unfortunately for him he loses the fight to grab a loose gun and it seems to be the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, it is saved at the right time by a precision shot by Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the sexiest law writer in the California police department. <br /> <br /> His heroic encounter earns the brunette a promotion for the first-class detective, and it is a company that is highly envied by its male counterparts. Meanwhile, a maniac dressed in leather is shaking the rubble of the city and throwing their bloody corpses on street corners. Ryder and Shine are on the case of the homicidal criminal and their first interrogation is a squalid street photographer named Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is a first-rate inspector that the normal police regulations do not seem to apply to her, so in a short time she will go out with the cameraman even if she is suspect number one. When the bodies continue to pile up around the city, do you decide to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the crazy S & M ?? <br /> <br /> If anything, Zipperface effortlessly sums up everything that went wrong with the slasher genre towards the end of its redire. What began as a great springboard for filmmakers and emerging theater actors had been reduced to a sewer of cinematic feces for film with flat direction, zero or shock suspense and mediocre talentless actors. The boom years of the early eighties, the splatter gestures managed to hide their lack of strong dramatic formations with sticky special effects and exuberant exuberant directing. Unfortunately, at this point in the cycle titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and The Majorettes seemed to have been produced in a conspiracy to put the category in which many of the characters of the aforementioned feature ended. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams does not even vaguely convince herself as an officer of the law and her inexplicably idiotic behavior - which includes doing a striptease for a main suspect in a homicidal murder investigation - is more incredibly pathetic than how much can you ever expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could not direct traffic and the vast majority of cast members would struggle to get a second reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but I didn't find anything here of merit or note. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you can keep the TV running until the end, you might be quite surprised by the identity of the killer. To be honest, though, I doubt you will care about that at that point. And another plus point? Well, erm .... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means that you could use it as a matt to place your cup of tea on ?? Apart from that, there's really no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Evil bad and not in a good way, it's 90 minutes of my life that I could have passed more constructively by tearing my hair out. Abysmal.
