Henry (Don Ameche) shows up at the entrance to Hell and tells his life story to His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on her relationships with women throughout her life, and in particular on her relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we cut Henry and His Excellency for a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing else to say about the film because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story of a man's life and very boring. I looked at it with my girlfriend and my father and we all thought it was rubbish, despite the touch of Lubitsch. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good every time he is on the screen like his grandfather and there have been some funny moments of dialogue. The color made it a good show but it wasn't enough to save this plodder from the pile of waste. In the same mold as "Its A Wonderful World" and "You Can't Take It With You", and therefore, not surprisingly, was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of which is interesting and has no interest. Boring, sentimental and the biggest wet squeak of an ending that I can remember ...
