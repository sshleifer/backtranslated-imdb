In my opinion, the ending is what completely ruined everything. The initial idea of ​​having someone suddenly realized that they were the son of God and the second coming was a bit smart. People started to believe him and his friends became the new disciples. People got mad, demons possessed people, all kinds of fun. Of course then everything went wrong. It was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a great deal of writing to find the "third testament" in five days, but then it eventually became this ridiculous humanist fantasy. I will not ruin it, but I will only say that it comes off as if it had been written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology. I heard that they are making an American film version of this story, I just hope they change the final look.
