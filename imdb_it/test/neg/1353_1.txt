First of all, I must say that I saw the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialogues and read the reproduction of 1936, which is different from the 1939 and contains nuggets of its own gold. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie in adultery. There's a reason why you haven't seen an expensive TV ad campaign for this. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the playful tone of the original and the way women spent all their time going to war with each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a theatrical chat about gossip, adultery and biting in the midst of a series of worthy socialists in Manhattan. The crowd that created this new version did not intend to honor the original material. They take it oddly, putting half a scene here and a half scene from the first version. Bette Midler (which is in a few scenes and recites the old part of the Countess in a wide and grinning style) has no context in this version. He mentions "Buck", which is a key element of the original, so he never mentioned him again. This film is so boring that I won't overwrite it, but here are some things I found incredible:> Mary Haines boasts of her home staff: "I can suck nails from a table!" Right. Great writing Norma Shearer could have read a line about this and got an Oscar, right? > A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the film just faded. Claire Booth used Sylvia as a comic engine that went through the game. Described in an immortal way by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant and spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible, still classic and quotable dialogues. He was not above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The directors of 2008 decided that this character had to die. By killing her, they killed the movie.
