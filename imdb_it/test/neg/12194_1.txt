What's the point of this movie? It starts as a movie, then changes tracks, cheats us of a resolution for that movie and ends up like another film that is nothing but a pale pale imitation of many other horror schlock movies you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, directed by Rodriguez, two guys who have already shown talent, but who now seem to believe their clamor and assume that whatever they do must be good only because THEY did it. But it doesn't work that way. You're just good at doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing involved in such a useless misfortune? Clooney initially makes a nasty bad guy ?? absolutely ruthless and efficient ?? and it would have been interesting to see where he was going. But of course we never do it. And the vampire's movie Clooney turns into a completely different character. He is not intelligent or witty, he is just a bad, bad job. Keitel seems completely uncomfortable, and it's no wonder. Has anyone in the studio taken a look at the script before this project got the green light? Tarantino is absolutely unpleasant as a murderous deviant sexual (and because, as a writer, he thought we would find rape, the gruesome murder and the slaughter of a harmless hostage). At every level ?? except the technician ?? this movie stinks. To avoid.
