I'm a music fan and I was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to go out in the middle of the movie. I didn't identify with any of the characters, which meant that I didn't care about what happened to them and I completely lost interest in the story. On the positive side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so that made a part of the film bearable. Even the parts where they talk about the bridge have almost redeemed the entire film, but I couldn't keep myself until the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the script wasn't adequate to make it even remotely interesting. The motto on "lavami" was absolutely rubbish. I wonder how many actors have had to be actors on that (I wouldn't be able to say those lines without bursting out laughing). However, such a sin could have been much better.
