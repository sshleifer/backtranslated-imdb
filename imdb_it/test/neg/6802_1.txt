I don't know how this film received so many positive comments. It can be called "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but those things do not compensate for the empty plot that was full of sexual allusions. I wish I hadn't wasted time watching this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was an insufficient excuse to promote strange and obscene behavior. It was just another Hollywood attempt to convince us that that kind of life is normal and OK. From the beginning I asked myself what was the point of this film, and I kept watching, hoping it would change and I was rather disappointed that it continued in the same way. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money to see him in a theater!
