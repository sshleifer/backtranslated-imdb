A former policeman who was expelled from the force due to unconsciousness (and who probably could beat Chuck Norris in a brawl) engages as a private bodyguard; his first client is a worthless type of playboy. First, it takes half the movie to get it expelled. A lot of great fighting choreographies but the plot is strictly by numbers, and the acting is wooden like dialogue. Give this a miss.
