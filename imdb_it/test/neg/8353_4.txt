If I had never seen an episode of the original Avengers, with Blackman, Rigg or Thorson, I would have appreciated this series more. While the cast did its best to support the action and interest of the scripts, I was involved in comparing the episodes with the original series. There was an expectation that Steed was more involved in the fighting scenes, and the continuity seemed as if the writers were struggling to keep up with the actors. To be honest, I can't blame them for trying to resurrect fans of the original series, but it just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it lasted a season. Watching Steed's labor through this series reminded me of General Macarthur when he said: "The old soldiers never die, they simply vanish!"
