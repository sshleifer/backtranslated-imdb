This is just the fourth effort I saw from this director (whom I met and found rather ingenious at the 2004 Venice Film Festival retrospective) and perhaps even the worst. As was the case with THE BRONX EXECUTIONER (1989), which preceded it, this is a prime example of the Euro-Cult era queue: first because it shows the depths to which the previously invigorating style had fallen at this time! <br /> <br /> Here, in fact, we have a plot that revolves around - I'm not kidding, people - a killer phone! Pretty but insignificant Charlotte Lewis - in her third film after PIRATES (1986) and THE GOLDEN CHILD (1986) - she is a model who, apparently, has just finished a relationship; she expects the architect's lover to call her back, but every time the phone rings, everything she gets is static, accompanied by voices from the afterlife (or some shit). He befriends a new tenant in his apartment building who, conveniently, knows an authority on paranormal activity (William Berger) - which, exhilarating, explains that the negative energy that is unleashed, for example, during family arguments can manifest through household appliances a deadly force (I swear I'm not making it up)! <br /> <br /> Among the highlights ... er ... the lowest points of the film are: the surly grumpy from whose dingy place the heroine calls a couple of times (it seems that the chain of events can only he breaks up by having Lewis, EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) - style! - hand in hand, the enormous variety of phones with an absurd appearance on display, the heroine photographer's friend who sneaks up on her before of the killing, the sarcastic policeman who greets Lewis in reporting the strange events ("And what is the toaster used to do, I wonder?"), the would-be rapist killed by a barrage of coins coming out of a phone booth, and death bloody of Berger (with the phone it influences the pacemaker of which it is endowed and it makes the doctor's heart explode)! <br /> <br /> The climax of the film is rather confused and, apparently, finally sees all the "lost souls" who inhabit a flock of doves and fly out of the window of the "possessed" office (a solitary service !). For what it's worth, the score - of the former Goblin Claudio Simonetti - is quite effective, despite the inclusion of heavy metal numbers dated on the soundtrack.
