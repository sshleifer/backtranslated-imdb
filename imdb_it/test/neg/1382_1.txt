Ok, I like to give the benefit of the doubt. I saw his show. <br /> <br /> It's not fun for me. All I remember was a lot of "strange" noises and screams. I don't think I even broke a smile. The only thing that looked a bit like humor was his piece by Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston. I think you can be more stupid by the minute looking at it though. <br /> <br /> Also, what is it with "Ask Whitey?" section? Is it a reputation for "Ask a gay friend? / Black man?" from the Chappelle show? Isn't it so obvious? But when Chappelle did it, he was exposing the subject's ignorance. Like Borat. But what happens when choosing white individuals at random and shouting things at them? It's not funny, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I'm pretty sure I heard certain "jokes" of his elsewhere ... it seems a bit like "cutting" pieces and pieces, throwing some "loud" shouts. <br /> <br /> However, it wasn't fun. Seriously. Don't waste your time either.
