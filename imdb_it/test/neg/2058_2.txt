This movie is just crap, I can't say it differently. From the beginning we know that it will be crap. <br /> <br /> The plot, the dialogue, the acting, the special effects, the make-up, practically EVERYTHING sucks. I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winners, but it's not even worth seeing, I can't believe how anyone produced this thing. <br /> <br /> It's not even about vampires, it's more about a dream / reality. The development of the film is inconsistent, the motivation of the characters is ... It doesn't exist, everything seems like a big joke. Maybe that's what they tried to do, but I sincerely doubt it. I would like to know what they tried to shoot but it just failed, it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (and I've seen many bad movies, but nothing compared to this) Please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT watch this . <br /> <br /> P.S. It is also full of clich√©s! Post scriptum 2 Bad Script, bad direction, bad cinematography. Post scriptum 3 I was concerned to comment on this as a favor for everyone.
