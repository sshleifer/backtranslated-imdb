This was to be set in the "Belt Bible" of Northern Ireland. Well, like someone who grew up there, and was a child in the era represented in the film, he didn't play as true! The accents were everywhere - far from County Antrim / Derry. The church doesn't look like anyone I've ever seen. "The Church of God" is a Pentecostal denomination, but that of the film was certainly not Pentecostal! The elderly minister was initially dressed in the robes of the Church of Ireland (Anglican) - and no C. of I. would have been called "The Church of God". The minister was often called "Reverend" - they could do it in some parts of the world but I never heard it when I lived in that area. The ministers were addressed as "Mr ......" <br /> <br /> This film was very poorly researched and the cast - quite typical of Irish cinema - annoying! A film can have a fantastic plot, but if it doesn't look authentic, it's rubbish.
