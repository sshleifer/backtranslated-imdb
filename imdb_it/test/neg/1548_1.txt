I remembered this horrible film I bought at Camelot's music store in the summer of 1989 when I was visiting my grandparents. It was a time when I had just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genre I had to offer ... or so I thought! At the time I was only 12, so I don't remember very well. I remember a psychopath who ran with a corkscrew that killed people, and a couple of policemen (I think) who were riding in a car that didn't really move, but who let themselves be rocked from side to side to look like it was. .. true cinemagic. I also remember that it was the worst movie I had ever seen up to that point and I immediately threw it in the trash. <br /> <br /> Something made me think of that movie tonight (I can't believe that I actually remembered the name), so I jumped on imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise ... IT WAS! And 5 other people saw it ... Incredible. Even though I remember hating the movie, at the time I wanted to keep it hidden somewhere because I'd like to see it again for a laugh (it would probably be a good game to drink). Anyway, I'm happy to be part of the elite of a few who saw this little "treasure". I'd like to take it somewhere for a couple of dollars .... but be careful, this is not a recommendation ... it's horrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
