Choose a stereotype, a stereotype (racial, sexual, cultural, etc.) And I bet you will find it in Wassup Rockers. Do you think all Hispanic teenagers are stupid, furry, inarticulate and dirty? Are Hispanic girls sex sluts, crazy, easy to fuck? Do all blacks want to fight and bear arms? Do all homosexuals organize theme parties with pink drinks and ask young people to shape for them? Are all white teenage girls rich and annoyed princesses who are bored by white teenagers and are looking for something a little more dangerous? If you answered "yes" to any of the previous questions, you, my friend, are a bigot, and AMERAI Wassup Rockers. <br /> <br /> Director Larry Clark loves to amaze his audience (I was 15 years old the first time I saw children and I think that's why I'm still a virgin), but Wassup Rockers isn't shocking ?? it's just bad. Try to be edgy and realistic with his minimal dialogue and close-ups on the body, but these characters and this story are completely unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Wassup Rockers is a teenager's fantasy. What 14-year-old boy does not want to be a skater who gets into trouble, makes the holidays fall, he drinks 40 years, and is told by the hot, rich and white girl that his uncircumcised penis "looks dangerous?" Besides the demographic, I really don't know who will enjoy this movie.
