This is one of the films that killed western "spaghetti". Not only does it lose something in translation, it is also a total chaos of editing. Both blocks have been modified and modified for an English version. In any case, it has little or no sense, period. He compares the films of "Trinity" and Eastwood "Man With No Name" as John Ford / John Wayne. Nothing in this film is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a means and (finally) an end. Except for the end, not everything is exactly in this order. Robert Wood looks quite attractive. The rest of the cast, especially women, should have made better career choices.
