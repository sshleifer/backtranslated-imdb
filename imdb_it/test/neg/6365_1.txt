When I heard that the film had to be published and the theme of what it was about, I felt very curious. But when I saw it it was the biggest deception of my life. From a technical point of view, the sound is poor, you can say about the dialog boxes of the men that have been redone in the studio and that have been poorly made in the final mix. According to everyone, photography is mediocre, some of the films show some soldiers wearing night-vision glasses, and the way the filmmaker achieves that "dark night" is lit up by everything as if they were in a real military base with lights , there is no reference used in the moonlight, my god! But not least, most of the works are really poor, the role of the wife of one of the soldiers is absolutely not credible, her performance is rather poor. <br /> <br /> Big disappointment, shame of the jury who chose to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
