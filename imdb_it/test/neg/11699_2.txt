Maybe it's because I read the wonderful book by Peter Straub before seeing the film, but I was terribly disappointed with this film. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common Hollywood-style elements. <br /> <br /> Too bad also because this film has an exceptional cast, particularly Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and the then largely unknown Alice Krige. They have not been given much value. <br /> <br /> Actually, I was all about leaving halfway, but a friend convinced me to stay until the end, because he was sure he should have done better. He apologized to me during the closing credits.
