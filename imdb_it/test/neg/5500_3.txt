this film has great potential: it is a great story and has the potential to be very disturbing. but, of course, Tim Burton does not actually make disturbing films, he makes bizarre and comics films. and I usually like Tim Burton's things. but I thought this movie was really weak. the best thing about the film (and it's really worth seeing just for that) was the art direction - the film has an incredible intangible quality to it. the script was not good. it was boring in some parts and confused in other parts, and there was no construction of characters. I never really cared that people had their heads cut off from a headless being. I thought johnny depp had a good thing about his approach to the character, but since the script was weak he couldn't go too far with him - and I was very irritated by the slight emphasis on his and Christina Ricci's parts. <br /> <br /> in any case, unfortunately it is not a great film and it is not worth seeing if you are not interested in the artistic direction.
