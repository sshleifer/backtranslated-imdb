A horrendous and completely ridiculous horror, a haunted house horror film that has an out-of-place place Anna Paquin who plays a neurotic teenager who fights "things-that-makes-them-in-the-dark" that are afflicting her and her family shortly after having moved to their new home in Spain (?!). Little more than a geographically re-stocked repechage of "The Shining" and in particular of "The Others", the dark "Darkness" is basically the typical B-horror run-of-the-mill characteristic with some predictable lame fear that can be view from the public one kilometer away (so to speak)! In retrospect, I suppose I shouldn't have set my personal expectations so high for this film to actually be good considering the well-known fact that it was set aside for almost three years before finally being released last Christmas at US cinemas last year across the country to what in the end was a lukewarm ticket sale and very hard reviews from critics. When will filmmakers ever learn that there is more to making films (be it horror or otherwise) than the simple possibility of a small financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
