The weakest of the "old" Star Trek films, this film suffers from a terrible script and obvious budget constraints, particularly in the poorly managed end. The bones of a good movie are here, and Shatner's direction is not as bad as it is commonly made, but the characters end up talking and acting out of the style that the previous 3 films had accurately established. Lawrence Luckinbull is convincing as the renegade Vulcan with mysterious and mystical powers to influence people and these powers are responsible for some of the best scenes, especially for Deforest Kelley who shines like "Bones" McCoy in his latest film. However, like those scenes, in the end they don't advance the plot and end up feeling more like a distraction. A large score of the always reliable Goldsmith and some funny scenes in Yosemite between the three main ones are not enough to cover the depths of the plot, and the frankly embarrassing attempts at humor serve only to alienate even the hard trekkies. All in all, a wealth of possibilities that although it fails to provide, has its moments. Watch out for the pool table in the bar fight scene ...
