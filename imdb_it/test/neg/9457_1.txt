Nothing but the director's youthful imagination comes to life. This "film" is nothing but an excuse for the director / actor to play kissy's face with an attractive young woman who otherwise would never give him the time of day. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, the direction is non-existent and the film draws while the actor / director / writer / narrator tells. Don't be fooled by the "X" vote, there is no nudity and tiny blood.
