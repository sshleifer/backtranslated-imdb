I wrote this as a two-part review. The second part contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, it's not about sex with car accidents. This is the one on racism in L.A. You know, the one where everyone is racist, and race is the topic in everyone's mind at all times. Race. <br /> <br /> It is like the film has a form of turret syndrome in which race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Breed relations. Relay race. <br /> <br /> Paul Haggis made a film that took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnection of people who are tangentially connected, and then turned it into a mental vomit of about 1 '53 "Racism in America RACE In the 24-hour period we have 7 stories that run parallel and all about race: the first hour, people say ridiculous things and do absurd things in an attempt to be sincere about racism in America. <Br / > <br /> For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is raised directly by The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cold and talking about foot and religion massages, the characters talk about race and racism, CONSTANTLY. <br /> <br /> The other good thing is Mexican history when the Mexican is talking to his daughter gives her his invisib the impenetrable cloak to protect it from bullets. Decent writing, but it is only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would have said in its place. <br /> <br /> The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene in which he is trying to fix the lock and the Mexican tells him that he needs a new door is short and stupid. Why would anyone behave like that? Is it realistic? Nooo. It reminds me more of the Doom Generation grocery store clerk. "Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly." If you look at the second part of the film, I hope your head is shot and your head without a body starts to cough nicely. <br /> <br /> I did not mention the breed in a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RUNNING FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks handsome and does nothing, and various other bad actors who act badly with a bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon harasses the wife of black producers, could I help him if I got in trouble? When Philippe is secondly guessing his writing of his racism partner, can I help but not create me? The film is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you. <br /> <br /> Now, mind you, this film was nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, plus a nod to Matt Dillon who actually tried to make a decent film job. Those who have been repaid for that, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Don't see it if you don't feel like being preached about racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script by 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with the real society in any way form or form. <br /> <br /> D- <br /> <br /> Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the lines of the story in the first half ... and spits them out new in a kind of redemptive, conclusive, the world is a great kind of coincidence. And it's actually one of the worst ways to do it. <br /> <br /> Take the 1999 Magnolia. People were not conveniently tied together over and over again. They were simply connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something where you knew someone else was involved. Crash takes this job to an extreme extreme. <br /> <br /> The stories are lined up so that everyone meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working in strange shifts? Dillon and Philippe were late compared to one of the first the next day? And why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't he have had more emotional tension than realism if he had been someone we didn't follow from one day to the next? As Phillippe takes only a casual hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everyone's freaking out. <br /> <br /> Finally, in the second part, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to convince the Hindi to shoot his daughter. It marked me and made me feel dirty. Not that Hindi shot their daughter, but they created a beautiful and moving scene and then they got the direct cause of the people who tore themselves up. It really marked me. For writers, not for the scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally unknown. There are too many coincidences and they require extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia, which was blandly connected, it had connections over connections over connections that were simply so exaggerated. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. You don't die though. You should have. I rejoiced when it fell. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is that it pulls a Magnolia. Not only in the structure, but has a montage on the song In the Deep where you see that everyone is depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern comments about it making all the characters sing with Wise Up by Aimee Mann. Unfortunately, Magnolia was released in 1999, while Crash was released in 2005. It is difficult to comment on a film that will not be made for another 6 years, but it has happened. Somehow. <br /> <br /> Total waste of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: the lowest rating ever; Overall: F ---
