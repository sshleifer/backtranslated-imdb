Especially if you love horrible movies. When I first started looking at it, all I could say was "I hope there's a dance sequence in it". Imagine my joy when not the two main characters danced, but the main ghost also started dancing. And on top of that, Sherman Hemsley sings the break dance song (not to mention the theme song). It makes me a little sad that he went bankrupt because of this movie, but I never liked him as an actor and really should have known. Not even the director will take credit for this film (and you should take a look at some of the other films he has directed!). <br /> <br /> A note of warning, though, the writer seemed to really love the jokes about, um, lower male regions. For example, one of the characters discovers a book called "Groins of the Darker Species". I'm not kidding. And this, to me, is the most disturbing part of the film. In addition to this, find the darkest video rental store in your city, take the movie, invite all your friends and laugh until you cry with Ghost Fever.
