Spoiler !! Bruce Willis, the part-time cartoonist and a funny guy plays a Hispanic assassin nicknamed as an African scavenger prairie dog? I imagine all the good Hispanic nicknames like Sicatriz (Scar), Scorpion, Viper, Cobra, Snake, Tarantula, Latigo (whip), Navaja (llama), etc. Weren't they available ?? And why would a South American hit man know a terrorist from the Irish Republican army ?? The last time I checked, the IRA is not trying to open a secondary office in South America. And why does an Irish prisoner as tough as a prisoner and tired of battles look like a middle-aged Richard Gere? I thought maybe this movie would be a parody of "The Crying Game" when Gere's character was introduced as the person who was chasing "The Jackal". What an ugly casting! And why would the FBI hire depraved terrorists to track down murderers? It seems that a terrorist goes for mass destruction, and a murderer usually strikes a target in a non-spectacular way. But Gere is the only person who has ever seen Willis alive, according to the FBI. I thought this film should have been a remake of the great movie "Day of the Jackal", but this film is just a darker version of "Assassins" with Stallone and Banderas. Both of these films are really stupid, and part of the nonsense is the fact that, given the audience, we are forced to watch Bruce Willis follow his routine and we should say "Wow! Isn't he smart?" THE PROFESSIONAL with Jean Reno was a much better film about murderers. "The Jackal" is just a movie about two big middle-aged millionaire actors who could be paid to stand around looking beautifully and pretending to be smart! "The Jackal" is so poor, I expected to see Sly Stallone, Dennis Rodman, Mickey Rourke and Jean Clod Van Dumme making cameo appearances as "other" assassins or FBI. Needless to say, "The Jackal" has escaped the FBI for twenty-five years, but as soon as Richard Gere gets the job, it's only a few days that "The Jackal" is kaput! I imagine the positive message of this film is: "Thanks to the terrorists, our streets are safe from the killers". Overall, the "Jackal" has no redeeming qualities.
