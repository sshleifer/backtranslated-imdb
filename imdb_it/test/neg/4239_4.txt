First of all, a warning. "How to marry a millionaire" is preceded by an apparently random five-minute orchestral performance of "Street Scene", a piece of Gershwin-lite treated with all the pomp and ceremony of, well, Gershwin. Sitting down takes a little patience. If you have the DVD, don't worry, you can jump forward. You will not miss anything. <br /> <br /> The film itself is one of the perpetual disappointments of 50s Hollywood, a film so supported by big star-powers, opulent mise-en-scene and perfect high-concept that failure seems inconceivable. The title alone is perfect. Generation after generation, however, they are forced to ask themselves: how is it so limping? The script is an albatross on the production's neck, a dead and smelling thing that suffocates everything and everyone before they can really trigger life. There are no comic situations, only isolated moments that play to laugh. Whenever a real comic scene threatens to develop, the film quickly switches to other, less interesting things. A case in point: the scene in which the three main women each bring a date to the same luxury restaurant. One of them, short-sighted, refuses to wear glasses out of vanity. One of the dates is married. A classic Hollywood farce, surely, complete with a mistaken identity, an angry wife and probably someone's cake? Well no. Instead, we cut the three dates while women react "comically" to the things their partners say. Hit the punch line and cut the next limp joke. If in doubt, let Marilyn enter a wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? <br /> <br /> The three stars are almost a perfect diagram of the life cycle of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. This was one of Marilyn Monroe's films, and the camera only eats it, even if the script gives her nothing. It is so luminescent that it seems almost newborn. Lauren Bacall, on the other hand, had been an important star for almost a whole decade, and knows how to dominate the screen even when she is framed with Monroe. He gets the one thing that passes for a real role and delivers the few good lines with a cynical shot - given the right material, he could have brought this to life. She is a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, she is not immediately ridiculous - and much less childish than her co-stars, giving her convincing authority. Betty Grable was far from being ageless and had eight good years with her co-stars, putting her close to the end of her Hollywood career. There is an air of desperation about her, sometimes stuck on the screen with nothing but a toothpaste smile and some fragments of comic timing, unable to interpret her true age, but not to make fun of anyone as a contemporary of this new, more acute generation of actresses, relying on the same old slap that had served her during her career (for Marilyn-skeptics, seeing the two juxtaposed in this film helps to focus on the subtlety and intelligence of Monroe in a kind way). She is also forced to bond with dead wood in terms of male co-protagonists (although all men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); he is unable to hit the sparks of the comics. Better to have given his role to Monroe, underutilized, which could be fun alone, and left Grable with Mr. Magoo's repetitive routine. <br /> <br /> That the film is as enjoyable as possible by fooling around with the succulent Hollywood production, the one that makes the tweexes of "By the Light of the Silvery Moon" recognizable. But somewhere, buried under jokes and limp professionalism, lies the outline of a sharp and cynical comedy about the wedding affair that Bacall could have sung - and the new generations of cinema spectators will sit down with 'How to marry a millionaire' in waiting for that movie, ready to be disappointed again.
