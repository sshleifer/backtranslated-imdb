Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Probably the person who shot this film never learned to film directly in a bright light. You can't see anything in this movie. It is dark. The parts where you can see something that the camera is directed directly at a light source in order to get large slow glows. So you can't see yet. This film should have been a radio game or something. Some parts of the film are actually mounted upside down due to some kind of crap effect. Low-budget films can be made much better than this. And the low budget isn't an excuse for this. An editor should have said something when he started editing and saw that nothing could be seen. Perhaps the producers would have to spend some of their small budget on a preview monitor so they could see what they shot. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so dark you can't see the horrible acting. It also covers the lousy sfx. People in film schools for beginners make better films than this. Movies shot with comfortable cams are better than this.
