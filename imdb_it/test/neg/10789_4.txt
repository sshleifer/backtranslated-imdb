I must admit that I am at a disadvantage here; when I learn something more about a film than other reviewers rather than watching it alone, then it's a problem. Although the plot of "The man who knew too much" seems generally simple, the film allows too many cryptic elements to hinder what could have been a satisfying mystery. When we get to the scene where a bewitched-looking woman establishes the secrecy of "the first degree of the ray seven times", I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something. <br /> <In retrospect, the cryptic note retrieved by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the handle of a shaving brush was a craft-written message that led to a dentist named Barbor, and eventually to Albert Hall, a place, not a person indicated by "A. Hall". But despite all the intrigue, the reason why the murder target was eliminated is never clarified. Ok, so Louis Bernard was killed because he knew of a plot to assassinate a diplomat named Ropa, but why was Ropa a target? Come to think of it, why was the note written and fixed in the shaving brush? Did Bernard have to refer to it from time to time to remind himself what would happen? <br /> <br /> With its disconnected scenes, "The man who knew too much" is difficult to follow and a little confusing, however I will credit Alfred Hitchcock for this first effort. For perspective, I will have to look at some of his other works of the same era, although this film certainly cannot compare with his later works such as "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
