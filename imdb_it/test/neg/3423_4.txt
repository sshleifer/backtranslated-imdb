Macbeth is one of the most told stories in cinema and has been translated many times in numerous theater and celluloid scenarios. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600s, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal between the royals and the pursuit of power by one man. The director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries to update Macbeth by inserting it in the underworld of Melbourne. A film in which the characters replace the pistol swords (wing Romeo and Juliet by Baz Luhrman) and royal vassals for the gangsters, Macbeth is a violent, violent but critically imperfect film. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being elevated to the Thane of Glamis by the King (as was prophesied by Macbeth by three witches), Macbeth begins to lay his eyes on the throne. One night the king comes to Macbeth's house and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) convinces him to kill the king to take power. Macbeth kills his master and then takes his crown. But success has the flip side, as Macbeth soon discovers, when he has to go to horrible lengths to protect his deadly secret. <br /> <br /> OK, first thing. The main fault of the film is Sam Worthington. His portrait of Macbeth is in a word ... boring. I honestly didn't care about Macbeth while watching the movie. I had more sympathy for Lady Macbeth than Victoria Hill because she was concerned about acting at least. Worthington sits grumpy and with a wooden face throughout the film. I felt like he was making his best impression of Johnny Deep's George Jung character from Blow ... but without the charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie before so I'm not sure if it was his or the director's fault, but in any case the glue that should have tied it all together in one cohesive unit is weak. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good, but when paired with Geoffrey Wright's Australian Gangster Motif it seems a bit out of place. Frantic action sequences mixed with long shaksperian reflections create a viable conflict within the film. I understand that this is Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But hard and fast action scenes after a three-minute soliloquy tend to become annoying if not a little pretentious. <br /> <br /> Camera work is very stylized and, for the most part, works well. One thing that I found annoying was the way the camera slowly moved back and forth, almost constantly. I don't mind shots like this is simply overdone. He goes beyond the realm of being cool and elegant and becomes irritating instead. In addition to this, the art direction and cinematography are quite well done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities that Macbeth possesses; elegant direction, Shakespearean dialogue, a strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (the strange sisters), and good help of brutal and bloody violence. All these strengths are forgotten when one considers the unimpressed portrait of Mac Worth by Sam Worthington. The role of Macbeth was essential to link everything together and in this sense Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, making Macbeth a forgettable incursion into Shakespeare.
