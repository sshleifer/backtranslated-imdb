OK, we got JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck, well Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty good based on the reviews, and had a pretty high start on my movie scale, but halfway through it I was dragging it out for so long that I kept losing interest. I'm really bored, probably because you can see right away what will happen in the end; the story is actually pretty naked, I skipped over 15 minutes and didn't miss anything! This film should have been a short job, maybe from about 45 minutes to an hour at the most. It starts well and ends well, too bad the filling is tasteless, boring, boring and missing everything except time. Some people say they like music; I don't care for jazz and I don't go to see films for their soundtrack, I go for the story and when it is pulled out ... well, the evaluations go down in my book. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good, open, very close, boring filler. The story was beautiful, but if you don't know what will happen a quarter of the way, you haven't seen too many thrillers.
