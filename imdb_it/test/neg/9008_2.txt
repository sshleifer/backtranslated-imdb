I had the odd chance of seeing him on Mystery Science Theater 3000, four years ago. I have to admit that it wasn't as bad as other sci-fi / horror movies of the time. The plot revolved around an astronaut returning to earth with alien embryos inside him. Now the plot is pretty weird, well, if you can even call it a plot. (Seeing a space program run out of a building and an old pickup truck is really fun!) I admit it's horrible by today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I can see myself 43 years ago looking and being fascinated by this film. It's not even close to the nastiness of Invasion of the Neptune Men, Manos: Hands of Fate or Future War. <br /> <br />
