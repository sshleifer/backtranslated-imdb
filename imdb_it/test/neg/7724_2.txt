When Uwe Boll, the cinema with the extraordinary man, released the first adaptation of House Of The Dead to a completely deserved hoax, it was generally accepted among fans of the original videogame that it would have been incredibly Moorish to contemplate the making of a sequel . The per capita ratio of Hollywood idiots has to be really high, because not only do we have a sequel, it has been distributed in the antipodes by Sony, a company that is not normally known for its taste in expensive felling. Released directly on television in America, the sequel improves the original in many ways, but in doing so it becomes more bland than interesting. The scale of the scenario is enlarged, with the action taking place in a deserted city that simply happens to surround a university where experiments have taken place in a virus that can revive the dead. In particular, the action is widespread throughout the university, where the first infected inhabitants are found. Simply put, the film differs from the original in that it actually occurs inside a house where dead people can be found. <br /> <br /> The cast, on the other hand, is a real step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specially created to look like a cheap Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the level of a slumming: it is Jürgen Prochnow. In fact, the only name that stands out from this cast is a Sticky Fingaz, who probably didn't want to be recognized easily by the people he faces at home. Simply put, these people could not convincingly order pizza on the big screen, even in the best possible direction. Say what you want about Boll, but at least he inspired actors like Ona Grauer to fight against his ineptitude. That being said, the people involved here seem at least to be aware of the fact that their movie sucks and that they might even have some fun. Much of the problem with the original was that the director thought he was creating a sort of misunderstood masterpiece, and he took it seriously. Unfortunately, with actors who don't take their characters or situation seriously, the least dramatic tension that could have been had been weakened. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is concerned with finding a zero-generation victim of whatever plague is causing the death of the dead. Or to translate into more practical terms, they are trying to find someone who was infected right after the virus turned into a form that was threatening humans. How this can help when an unmutated strain is usually required to create a vaccine, nobody knows, but the way this research is stimulated suffers from its own problems. The we-have-to-go-back weft device is used to compensate for the execution time, but the actual times of the extra search are also problematic. At one point we are told that the city will be canceled by cruise missiles in ten minutes, yet the heroes return to the university, identify the sample they are looking for and fight enough zombies to eat the Chinese army, all in this space of time. Filmmakers take note: it only pays to be specific with the time it can serve rather than hinder dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> The special effects used in House Of The Dead 2 leave those of the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the deaths of characters using idiotic gimmicks, Michael Hurst instead uses all the graphic details his budget can allow. Necks are bitten, arms are cut, heads are fired. All this makes a much more convincing throughput, but also prevents the mockery of obvious falsity. Photography is also much improved. As DVD Crypt says, the fact that it is focused in everything makes it an improvement over the original, but this also deprives us of something to have a laugh at the expense of. Writing is also an improvement and a setback. Throughout the script, references to other horror and survival horror films are offered, the most obvious being Run Like Hell. The first couple of times, they work because they offer smart ways of working titles in ordinary and everyday dialogues. After the eighth time, however, they become nervous because they remind players of the things they would rather do with their time. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that House Of The Dead 2 costs only six million to bring to television screens throughout America. Since Tom Savini alone would cost more than this to work on a movie nowadays, I have to say that I'm somewhat impressed with the visual results. In contrast to the very insulted original, the zombies here look like real zombies, rather than appeared in bad photos. In a further contrast to the original, the actors seem to have the faintest idea of ​​what they are doing. Sealing the deal is the fact that, apart from some real zingers scattered everywhere, the characters speak like real people. However, history is nothing that we have not already seen thousands of times. When Aliens, the real Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released to cheer, the praise came from the fact that these films did something we had never seen before, or they did it so well that we didn't really care . House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough not to mock him, but he brings nothing new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we end up not worrying either. <br /> <br /> For this reason, and many others, I gave House Of The Dead 2 two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too ugly to be good. Unless you're as interested in sucky movies as I am, it's best to avoid doing it.
