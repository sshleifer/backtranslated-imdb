What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man struggling with a garden hose? The acting, especially that of the protagonist Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. Dialogue is so invented and little fun that it makes you shudder. The idea of ​​control is not really bad for this genre (adolescent infantile comedy), but, in some way, the director manages to make the least of it. I consider it a 2 out of 10.
