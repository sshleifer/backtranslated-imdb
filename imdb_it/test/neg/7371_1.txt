A film about an interesting and sensitive period in history, shot in a beautiful environment, has managed to present a terribly banal and obvious production, a grossly clumsy script, a lack of continuity, intrusive slushy music, sugary casting and pale acting. <br /> <br /> It was a shaky one between the script and the acting which was worse. Probably the script won: the historical dialogues, the background and the descriptions of the characters were explained with painful details in the dialogue. .. in reality the words are not able to describe how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> In a pre-release screening there was a massive exodus for about thirty minutes. At about an hour many of those left were laughing loudly. I must add that I am a Francophile, I am fascinated by Canada and I love the historical film. This was really an out.
