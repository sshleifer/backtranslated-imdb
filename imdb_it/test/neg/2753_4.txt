If you like the Three Stooges you will undoubtedly like this 17 minute short. There were certainly some funny moments, but like all the Stooges' works, it revolves around their particular style of slapstick comedy, and I must confess that somehow the Stooges never really did it for me. Their slapstick always seemed angry rather than amusing, and even though it was obviously fake, their antics seemed increasingly likely to cause pain rather than provoke laughter. In this short, the slapstick revolves around attempts to find a wife (who is a professor of music in this), because he has just inherited half a million dollars on the condition that he will marry within 48 hours of reading. One of his students is interested, but once the word of the inheritance comes out, suddenly there is a long line of potential brides, and a good fight between cats emerges between them. Stooges fans will appreciate. For me, it has all the elements that drive me crazy for them. 4/10
