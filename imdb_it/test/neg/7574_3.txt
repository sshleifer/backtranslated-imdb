Amando DeOssorio has never let a lack of budget prevent him from telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started off great, but had some really ridiculous moments, like the blows of a small model boat in a water tank for "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent", it hits the bottom and brings with it some remarkable actors, telling the story of a silly monster that brings the terror of Google's eyes to a few aquariums and miniature aquariums. <br /> <br /> A vague opening sequence prepares the ground and demonstrates an aborted military mission in which American pilots, for an unknown reason, launch an atomic bomb (incidentally drawn in the frame of the film) somewhere in the ocean off the Spanish coast. The military commander gives this order from an office that features a prominent American flag and a portrait of a deranged-looking Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that really makes this movie the eighties. The other two are the hilarious and inept subtitle that declares the year as "1,985" and the outdated Sheena Easton hairstyle of Tyria Power, which would have looked very beautiful next to some torn neon sweat. <br /> <br /> One of the most kookiest monsters you will see will emerge from the depths, disturbed by the explosion caused by the bomb. We learn that the wandering atomic bomb has killed a large quantity of local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Snake, which descends rapidly on the coast of Spain for miniature chaos. <br /> <br /> Now, when I say that the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerating. It's not just a kind of "fake look". I'm sure the filmmakers did the best with the ten dollars that seem to have been awarded, but most of the time it seems to have been made with Crayola markers, a ping pong ball and an old sock. Not only that, it has this disturbing music that accompanies it everywhere, music that sounds so much like the "Jaws" theme which is a wonder that no one has been sued. <br /> <br /> Together with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland were surprised to stagger, and the dialogue could not have been more dismal. Through a series of plot tricks, our main actors are put together in a search for ... well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power must show that the snake is real to save their butts (he is accused of a shipwreck caused by a snake, is stuck in the asylum after a sighting). None of this is important, because at the end of the film nothing has been solved. No one admits that the snake is real and is not even dead. Furthermore, Power and Bottoms are still far from the law. <br /> <br /> As illogical as it may seem, no one but our heroes knows that the snake exists (despite the numerous disappearances, a trashed lighthouse and a crushed railroad bridge), and they undertake an extensive non-adventure trace down and chase the monster away ... don't kill it, since they know they can't compete with it. Their plan is to use flares to scare them. Although their scheme has failed, the snake causes a large explosion in the water after it has attacked a support bridge (don't ask), and the giant sea serpent is so scared that it swims away. The critical viewer will wonder why the snake was not frightened before in the movie when it caused a couple of large explosions after crashing into a pier. But it does not matter. Swim away, and our heroes are sure that it will be gone forever. The end. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine the horror the stars felt when they saw the complete movie they just worked on. A lamebrain script and a couple of dim reaction shots could never have prepared them for the embarrassment of sharing time on the screen with a puppet in marionette / stop motion. At least the supporting characters had fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed up by a giant snake head. I'm not sure what was happening when they made this film; the monster is cheap, but there are some rather elaborate miniature sets, so someone spent some time doing those, not to mention the stop-motion animation in question. It seems to have worked properly, although perhaps the sense of humor in this film went through my mind. In the end, the film is nothing but an easy target for a drunken comment. Watch it at a party for the best results.
