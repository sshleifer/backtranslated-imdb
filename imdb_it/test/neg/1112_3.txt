Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: the empty house next to the abandoned mine in the woods with a tragic past; the family moves into the house and strange things begin to happen; creepy little kids start popping up here and there doing creepy things, little kids. But that's where the intelligence and potential fun ends. This group of children was sealed in the mine many decades before, and now appears to wander in the woods (poor makeup) with weapons in search of meat to eat. Oh, I see, this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm .... while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre, this didn't work. What was the children's motivation to try to devour the meat? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine that the directors had gathered around the daily movie giggling because they thought it would be a cold / scary movie? I discovered that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation that I had just wasted time in another modern crap. While the acting was good, and the setting / cinematography of good quality, the script itself suffered from what appears to be a lack of knowledge of the supernatural horror genre of the whole. A group of children walking along the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly masked rodents. <br /> <br /> This film is not scary, and while I appreciate the story, maybe I even liked it if I had read it instead of watching it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more precisely called Wicked Little Turd.
