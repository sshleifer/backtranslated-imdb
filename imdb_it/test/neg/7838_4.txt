The film career of Jean Claude Van Damme seems to have gone to hell in a handcart so ironic to see him play a character who meets the same fate literally right at the beginning of the film! It is also interesting to note how very, very similar are the plots of his films, regardless of who the producer, director or screenwriter is. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France, but due to a series of circumstances he is in another part of the globe where he has a brother who dies and it's up to Van Damme to get revenge helped by a character he has just met. Watch AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films with the title "Protagonists of Jean Claude Van Damme" and all present almost the same type of narrative structure. This does not mean that they are identical, of course, only very similar and if you've seen a Van Damme movie, you've basically seen them all. It is the same with the MAXIMUM RISK
