San Franpyscho: 1 in 10: so you want to make a serial killer movie. But your budget is non-existent, your photographic equipment is old and your stars are Joe Estevez (Martin Sheen's younger brother and a base film in the really bad movies) and Todd Bridges of Different Strokes. There are probably ways to pull at least one watchable movie. The Quiroz brothers have no idea. <br /> <br /> First of all most of the cast seems to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Oscar-sized actors look like Bridges and Estevez. Really how difficult is it to play a priest or a bully mother? Certainly a city the size of San Francisco has few professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and a credit on the screen. Clearly Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger acting in these roles have other talents like the landscape architect or the maid that should be fine-tuned. <br /> <br /> Joe Rosete as the killer (yes, the serial killer is simply known as "The Killer" ") is also quite horrible in a way of mentally ill method, but I'm almost willing to give him the benefit of doubt because his character is written with zero style or personality, an almost boring and almost ridiculous serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the Quiroz brothers seem to have initially planned this film like an ABC family movie of the week.There is no nudity or violence to talk about and the R rating is clearly for adult style pacing.This move unfolds like an 85 year old woman driving with wraparound sunglasses and its turn-on signal The only occasional horror comes from lighting up Estevez's face with a glow that makes his lower jaw appear to have been removed. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a great movie when I rented San Franpyscho but I do not expect I was both the mind that numbs boredom.
