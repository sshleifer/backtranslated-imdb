I didn't like watching DS9 compared to other Star Treks, even Enterprise, but I didn't like Babylon 5 and now I know why. I'm the same show. I have just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from the creator of Babylon 5, but chose not to sue for a reason I don't know or worry about, but to see how a Star Trek series is based on another show even more nerd only in very bare, now I will condemn anyone who also talks about the DS9 when it comes to the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorites in this order. I didn't understand why everyone thought DS9 was great and I didn't, but I know I know. It is also because the captain has a real problem of anger, and I hate people who behave well, but freak out of the blue; and it seems on every episode.
