Ghoulies IV starts in a storage facility of the museum where the blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) in PVC and leather is looking for an ancient jewel, after challenging several guards she summoned the demon Faust who she loves and wants to have sex, unfortunately she has lost the jewel so she is not very happy and orders her to get the last one left ... Who belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who has experience in demonic possession and things like that after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra decides to find the jewel so that she can bring Faust to Earth permanently on the other side, well I don't really know. Erm, this is really ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski whose very name gives me chills down my spine when connected to a movie I'm about to waste 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV is as I expected full, complete and complete crap from beginning to end and it's so simple and simple. The, ahem, 'script', cough, by Mark Sevi has practically nothing in common with the other Ghoulies movie, except in the title and they managed to convince Liapis to resume his role which also has the advantage of being able to use filmed from the original even if it has no relevance. The story is almost non-existent, the whole film is a real struggle to watch, it's incredibly boring and boring, it's slow, it's predictable, it's perfectly clean with regards to blood or blood and has two goblin comedians that I assume are I was supposed to fill the share of the Ghoulies even though they didn't look like the previous films at all and in fact they are simply embarrassing to watch, in fact I think they were practicing to become ventriloquists during most of the film like when they speak their mouth from don ' ... You know, I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore so please believe me when I say this is a huge piece of elephant size proportions, don't waste your time or your money. <br /> <br /> Dirctor Wynorski turns into a really bad movie on almost every level, the special effects are terrible like the whole movie is. Apparently Ghoulies IV is meant to be a sort of horror comedy, but it misses both goals for the proverbial mile and is neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this film is the actress Randall in her pvc and leather dress that goes around trying to find the jewel and hardly worth sitting in the middle of this garbage to see. There is a decent and half decent car scene with some crashes but it seems to have been edited from a completely different film and given Wynorski's track record I'm sure it was. Forget any gore because there is none. <br /> <br /> Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious that it has a low budget but that it's simply not an excuse to be so bad, right? Liapis is back in the cast although he probably wants him to stay away, Randall, the girl dressed in PVC, is easily the best thing about this movie that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is crap, there's nothing else to say really. I honestly can't see anyone who likes movies getting something from this, I can't. I can't believe I'll recommend the original Ghoulies on anything, but now it's going to happen because even if it's shit, it's much better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people and you can thank me later. The things I sit like this you don't have to, honestly ...
