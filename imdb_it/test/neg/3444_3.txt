this show disturbs me. takes the slots on the nick at night that could be reserved for the fresh prince or George Lopez. also full house and Roseanne. they are all better than home improvements. first of all, mother Jill bothers me so much. she is a plaintive and insensitive child and I really despise her. Brad is a fat toad and he's boring too. and the younger brother, I don't even know what it's called! I don't notice it at all! it's probably not the actor's fault, it's probably writers. Tim is just a stupid ass. although Jill is DEFINITELY my favorite, I don't like any of them. the only reason I gave this stupid three-star show is that a star goes to Randy. like the middle child, he is still an annoying little brother, but an older brother, and I like his funny character. the other star goes to Al. like the chubby friend, his character is nice. apart from Randy and Al, this show sucks.
