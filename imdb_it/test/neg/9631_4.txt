By 1971 it was becoming increasingly clear that Hammer's film studios were on the verge of extinction. HANDS OF THE RIPPER is a case where even the idea smacks of despair - Jack the Ripper's spirit owns his daughter! Yes, okay, no one expected a documentary, but this plot seems to scrape the bottom of the barrel for silly premises and you find yourself wondering why the producers brought Jack The Ripper into history. Was this to give the film a snappy title? <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not impressive and the cinematography gives the entire film a feeling of cheap TVM, but you know that you won't be watching a classic Hammer horror film as soon as the title starts because the music is ridiculous inappropriate. I think the composer is trying to make the melody of the theme disturbing and touching, but the music looks like something from a romantic romantic movie. I will give the cast a little credit because they take their roles seriously in what is a film that is anything but serious <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie very much and immediately remembered the Phantom Raspberry Blower Of London Town from The Two Ronnies I was laughing about in the weeks before I saw it
