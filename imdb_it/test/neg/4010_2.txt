This useless film was a complete disappointment. None of the characters is pleasant, so watch what happens to everyone without really worrying. The worst thing was to rent this movie in a gay-owned place only to find that this story of male pushers was full of young homophobes engaged in numerous straight sex scenes and not a single gay sex scene.
