"Stick Around" is one of the short film series that accompanied Bobby Ray with Oliver 'Babe' Hardy before Hardy's immortal team with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - the gormless little man and the overbearing big man - were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but this is simply not true. Ray and Hardy play each other well, but in reality they are not a team; in each of these films, Ray has multiple shoots and is clearly destined to be the hero, while Hardy angers him in a very different way from his treatment of "Stanley's" character ". It is very clear that the relationship between the small Bobby and the great Babe was inspired by Chaplin's previous films, in which the little tramp was bullied by the huge Mack Swain or burly Eric Campbell. <br /> <br /> However, in "Stick Around", Hardy wears a bowler hat that is identical to his next headline "Ollie" (albeit with a full whisker), and he and Bobby - after spending most of it of this film as opponents - they end up drunk comrades. <br /> Bobby is a paperhanger for the firm of Matz and Blatz, with Hardy as his boss. When the late Bobby tries to pretend to have promptly introduced himself, there is a clever physical work between the two men that reminds me of a routine performed by Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton in "The Garage". A little later, Bobby Ray - whose brief acting career never developed a character on the screen - performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel, when he pulls a long ladder from a tool kit much smaller. /> <br /> The paperhangers go to work in a sanatorium, and there are the usual unrealistic representations of mental illness: a resident insists on sitting on a piece of toast because he thinks he's a poached egg! There are also some strangely racist (and insipidly rude) gags involving a black man who kindly lets the inmates break the nuts on top of his head. When he sees an * image * of a lion - not even a photograph, mind you - he behaves cowardly as if he were a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Attacking" is pretty terrible. Most of the pantomime and acting is much broader than it should be for a slapstick comedy; even Hardy, already a very thin actor in 1925, played badly with his over-acting here. There are several bad examples of matching shots. I was impressed by an unusual camera set-up, when a fat pawn is dirty and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand-held mirror rather than his real face. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COMING. During their brief mating, Hardy generally played Ray's boss or opponent or both; here, for once, they end up as friends. It's a nice ending, but it doesn't compensate for what is really a poor movie. My score for this is only 4 out of 10.
