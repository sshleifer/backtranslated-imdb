Love and human remains directed by Denys Arcand is an abysmally pathetic film in that it is completely different from the type of film he has made throughout his career. Making a different film is not a questionable issue, what is problematic is the fact that if a master's film is incomplete, then it is really a bad event. The film begins on a positive note as some suspense is created. However, as the film progresses, what is shown is only a futile attempt to create something meaningful as Arcand shows us half a dozen extravagant and bizarre characters whose lives are intertwined. Homosexuality and lesbianism are of no consequence. What is even more annoying is the feeling of guilt associated with the characters who are rather in a correction about their feelings towards each other and sexuality. A film might interest those who want to see a different Denys Arcand movie. all, there would certainly not be many buyers for this film.
