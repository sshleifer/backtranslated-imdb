Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow plays Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (Rhymes with kick!) A karate instructor who helps a Cash (Jolie) escape from Pinwheel, its creators who try to detonate and destroy a rival company. Along the way, Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd show up to move the duo, while Jack Palance is there to provide a guide to the fleeing duo. One of the things that is pretty shocking about the Cyborg franchise, is the way the series has managed to have fairly prolific and off-beat cast actors. The original had Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon (don't they know it? Well, she was in a group of pornos from the 70s), this one has Jack Palance, Elias Koteas, Billy Drago and Angelina Jolie. The third has William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, the Cyborg 3 cast isn't that impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I've seen it on the Sci-Fi channel and I have to admit I wasn't impressed. In fact, Cyborg 2 is a film with an often lovely look, it is shot with an excellent style and its visual detail makes it easily visible. However Cyborg 1 was the same way, in fact the film was directed with a certain amount of style, in slow motion and music that made everything easier to view. Unfortunately like the first one, this one has no new ideas or anything that looks like plot or plot. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons the film doesn't have much to offer besides its appearance. Another aspect is the terrible acting. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are doing well, but seriously Palance plays a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I imagine that on the positive side, Michael Schroeder cannot be accused of not being ambitious with casting. The film is still boring and I for one have lost interest in the story for fifteen minutes. Also why did they tie him up with Cyborg anyway? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which manages to be worse than. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
