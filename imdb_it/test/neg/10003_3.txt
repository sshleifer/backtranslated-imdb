The brass photos (films are not a word for them) are really a bit brassic. Their seductive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-end commercials. But unfortunately the photos of Brass are films with the pretense of wanting to entertain the spectators for over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flaccid than they do bear erotic and smoky qualities. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of a film by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of love and lust senseless in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass shifted the action from the 19th to the 20th century, 1945 to be precise, so there are murals by Mussolini, men with black shirts, German uniforms or the torn dress of the partisans. But it is only the window dressing, the historical context is completely negligible. Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls in love with her amoral friend SS who always wears too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well trained and clearly above the material Italian actress. Its wide range of facial expressions (signaling boredom, disappointment, delight, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to look at this image and deserve two stars. It endures this fundamentally trash material with a surprising amount of dignity. I wish some really good parts came for her. She really deserves it.
