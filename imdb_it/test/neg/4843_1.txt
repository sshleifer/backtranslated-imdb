Sure, you can see some tits, but if that's all you're looking for in a movie, you get more miles from YouTube. I just paid a dollar from Redbox because I saw the name of Val Kilmer. Wrong move. The plot was not thickened, the dialogue was poor, the characters not fully developed. Someone said that cinematography was fine, but don't expect too much. This film moved very slowly and ended without grace. Blacklist. I spent most of the film wondering if some event or color scheme of things was symbolic. In reality I never rewound to understand it because in the end nothing was explained. No twists. He also left many questions that apparently I didn't want to hear an answer. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
