I took this for my birthday in a casket with the name of Broke Skull. Well, after seeing one on the DVD and being pleasantly surprised, I let in this sucker. It was worse than I expected, and I didn't expect much. This film is basically a twisted story of a boy who dies and comes back to life with the crowd and other crap. There were some interesting ideas in this that were never followed. Now everyone said there was a lot of blood, can anyone tell me what they were? I saw a bad effect of a crushed head, brain tissue (or something ...) and blood coming from the penile area twice. I have to say that the part where the boy was biting his hood made me retort, that was the only good thing about this film. And that gay sex scene was just thrown out for no reason. The acting in this was atrocious, really, it blew. That Asian girl was annoying, then the annoying Mexican boy who comes to be killed. I say that if you take it in a casket, that's fine, but don't spend money for nothing.
