Unfortunately, Koontz seems destined to die without seeing a decent adaptation of his work. Whispers follows the original book very closely, apparently until the production company has run out of money. All the sets of the first half of the film have been meticulously recreated from the book - something that has been missing in many other Koontz films. Despite his other (numerous) falls, I continued to look forward to some really great landscapes. Mistaken. When the detectives show up at the crack head apartment (in the book), the film is without funds and one of the most suspenseful scenes in the book is ruined. Where the book offered gruesome discoveries, a search and a hunt through the boys 'apartment, the film offers the back seat of the boys' car. <br /> <br /> Let's face it - Koontz writes without a budget in mind, because imagination is free. If a Koontz novel is ever turned into a decent film, nobody will see it, because they have been disappointed so many, many, many times before. This is why Dean Koontz's Frankenstein is now just Frankenstien - if you had seen your work slaughtered so many times, you would go out early if it seemed to happen again!
