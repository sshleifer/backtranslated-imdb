If it were possible, I would have given this sorry excuse for a ZERO star movie. It was by far the worst I've ever seen. It was as if it were a film of origin that some bored students decided to play as a joke. The "acting" was horrible. The "actors" did not even react to the fact that they were killed. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I bought this movie by mistake. The Spanish title said Jeepers Creepers 3, so I thought maybe it would be ok. Mistaken. It was honestly the worst ever. I didn't spend 20 minutes of the stupid movie. I skipped the chapters and nothing interesting ever happened. <br /> <br /> The cameramen were also terrible. It was like a home movie. I would not recommend anyone to watch this. Terrible terrible movie.
