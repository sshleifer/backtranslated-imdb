Let me tell you a story. <br /> <br /> One day, in the streets of Athens, a director came across a prostitute and decided that the world only needed to know his story because ... you know ... it's private ... and he takes off his shirt a lot and ... so on. <br /> <br /> This film is the result of its revelation. Repulsive, depraved, homophobic, misogynistic ... but obviously full of nice guys with their breasts they show. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie then have fun, if not avoid it like the plague. <br /> <br /> It has discouraged me to go to Greece, that's for sure.
