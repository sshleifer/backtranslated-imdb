"Chupacabra Terror" is saved by a "1" from the presence of the Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as a heroine, is a delight to watch, from the front, from the back and from the side, otherwise what you have here is your standard monster movie, playing as a low-cost and on-board version of THE RELIC, John Rhys-Davies plays the captain of the ship on which the monster is transported, and the non-rude monster is simply a man in a suit and tie. , bloody killings, at least, so the number of people that count in this episode is really fantastic .. Formula, to say the least, I love the moment when Simmons menacingly tells someone what chupacabra means: goat eater! oooohhh ... scary!
