This film deviated from the Bible and thus fell under the bar of the 1956 film. I hate that they replaced the 2006 film with respect to the 10 traditionally seen commandments. Moses looked like a criminal in this film, not like the kind man Charelston Heston in the 1956 movie. I won't waste my time watching this movie anymore. They tried so hard to modernize this film to keep you on the sidelines that it was more like a soap opera (and not a good idea). I'm pretty sure that the younger ones out there who never paid attention to the original 10 commandments might disagree with me, but with each his own. Furthermore, it took 10 years to realize the first 10 commandments, it probably took 2 months to make it happen. The special effects weren't as surprising as the first and after all these years with so much technology, you would have thought they would have done better now.
