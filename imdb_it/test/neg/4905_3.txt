This low-budget film about a writer who goes to work in a London casino has a horrible script, wooden shows and not much to recommend. Obviously it is aimed at intellectuals for whom "mainstream" is a dirty word and who automatically add 20 IQ points when listening to a British accent (apologize to Jeff Foxworthy). <br /> <br /> The script is full of holes (has it already written a book, or not?), clichés (relationship problems: it works days, it works evenings), and it provides so little insight on bases like character motivation which requires an off-screen narrative just to move the story together. <br /> <br /> In an attempt to prevent the public from snoozing, it includes a street fight scene that is as realistic as Giulio Cesare's high school production. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​sparkling dialogue is "I'll see your ten, and I'll raise twenty", then RUN to see this movie. Otherwise, save your money. <br /> <br />
