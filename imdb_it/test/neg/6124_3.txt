The dominant conflict is between a couple of good actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the horrible script. Evidently, the actors have lost, since the director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the main couple to follow this useless piece of sick imagination to the letter. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Huppert and Dutronc greatly improve the overall quality of the film, which miraculously achieves depth and humor. As for Chabrol's perseverance in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches its climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you'll wonder what pills it was taking while directing it.
