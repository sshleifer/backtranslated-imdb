Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer films that somehow make me worry about the people inside. I don't care about anyone in this movie. Was this supposed to be a comedy? Perhaps the humor was too subtle for me (up to the dwarf level). The fact is that he has lost so many things. There were characters that could have been fun, but they weren't. There were characters you could have wished for, but you didn't. For example, the guy who thought the Beatles tore his songs. There was so much potential there, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how they screwed him. Haha. And the previous poster spoke of the "I am the Walrus" scene as if it were special. What? He played "I am the Walrus" on an old piano and sang out of tune. Is there an internal joke there? Definitely stank of face value. This film gives me the feeling of a movie that people say they like because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" to say you like it, that you get the whole metaphysical message of art / garbage that the artist is expressing. If you want to be entertained, stay away.
