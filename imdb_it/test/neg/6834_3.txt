I couldn't wait to see Bruce Willis in this, especially since I remember being hypnotized by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This film is a perfect example of how film companies can make a very beautiful and silent story until it is just another frigate formula of the fabulous American law enforcement system / army VS, (the Russians ... I don't mind that the cold war is over, do it with the Russians) against the terrorists, probably similar to 50 other films. <br /> <br /> It also treats its audience like a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapon is good, simply ridiculous, did we seriously expect to believe that the most feared and experienced assassin / terrorist would choose this for a murder? <br /> <br /> The central point of the original story was the double stretch of intellect between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who creates a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his goal and then leave. None of this has survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA / FBI / army against the plot of the evil terrorist, whom we have all seen 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But of course the film company's MBAs have realized that here a new intellectual angle would lose their revenue from the band of short attention, so the answer is ... Bruce Willis, BIG explosions and a paralyzed plot. They assume that the American public is not able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesman (where France is on the map after all) so he is an American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a film contaminated by the boardroom.
