It is painfully obvious that the people who made this "movie" have never seen such fantastic parody as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This film is terrible, as are the actors. They wouldn't know how to act even if they hit them in the face, as it seemed to me to do while watching this pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> The film is stupid and has no humor in what ever. I'm sure I could make a better movie with my friends. It is incredible to me that a film can fail so much. Not a single smart or fun line. No trace of intelligence behind it. It's a pathetic film and I'd like to meet the person who really likes this movie. How disgusting!
