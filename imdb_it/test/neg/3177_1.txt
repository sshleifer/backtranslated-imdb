The action was episodic and there was no narrative thread to link the episodes together and advance the story. The plot limps. With few exceptions (eg Graham Greene) the acting was not inspired, and at most the pedestrian. The actors seemed to have something in their heads, apart from the scene they were in. It is tedious to watch a man drive a car through the semi-desert country of the setting of this film, whether he is driving badly or well. These scenes are typical of the voltage level in the video. So there was nothing in this video to engage or attract the viewer, to make him or her worry about the characters and the outs. I am doubly disappointed because I rented this film based on the reputation of the executive producer (Redford) and the writer of the novel on which it was based (Hillerman). I note that the jewelry box states that the funding is provided by PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, in addition to Carlton International. I hope this video was as disappointing for them as it was for my wife and me, to the point that they do not finance other disasters from the same source.
