Is it a bad movie? Don't believe me on the word. Consider the following press releases from people who have tried to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 路 While he was watching this film, the brain of Mr. Harold Faber of Sandusky, Ohio, was forcibly expelled from his skull 200 km / h and preceded to wriggle on the floor screaming at NOOOO NOOO NOOOO. <br /> <br /> 路 Mrs. Louise Robbins of Enid, Oklahoma, a 69-year-old retired housewife, committed a ritual seppuko with a butter knife while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> 路 Ms. Janine Hosmer of Columbia, South Carolina, gave birth to a severely deformed child while watching this film, even though she was not pregnant. <br /> <br /> 路 While watching this film together, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence Wells of San Franciso, California spontaneously exploded with such force that Wells' left shin was later found embedded in the wall of a house in Marin County. <br /> <br /> There have been many similar incidents. <br /> <br /> Of those who have not suffered more serious effects like those described above, at least 75% have become incurably, violently and understandably crazy after seeing this film. Of the remaining 25%, most had already been crazy before seeing the film; the rest was blind and / or deaf or in a persistent vegetative state. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying don't rent it, if you wish. I'm just bringing back what was in the newspapers.
