I only gave this movie a 4 because I saw it in 3-d. If you don't see it in 3-d, I give it a 2. This movie is so ugly that it's not funny. Anyone can make a movie like this for a week's pay. Bad acting, effects and history !!! But it was nice to look in 3d. Why can't they make good movies in 3-d format ???
