I come from Bangladesh, and here, C.C.Costigan is a goddess of fantastic sex. Jokes aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night, watching movies on the Encore: Action channel, when we came across a series of science fiction films. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd, (Stalone almost ruins his career) and then a film called Lethal Target. One might think that the "Lethal Target" title could only be awarded to a really cool, and really croaking Rambo knock-off. But no, what is delivered is what I'd like to call a "semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action movie, semi-sci-fi" ... actually, I think I can say that this isn't even a movie in all. If it were not for the hotness of the main character, my friend and I would have turned the film off while the credits were running. <br /> <br /> I have some questions for people (I wouldn't dare to say "professionals") who made this film. -One, In the future, why are they using the weapons we used in 1999? Oh wait, I understand, that's all they could get their hands on ... right ??? ... well then, .. because the main character wears what looks like a normal linen shirt and a jacket, a bit like what people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... I understand ... in space, it MUST have been a fashion statement .... well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY the main character pulls out a 3.5 disk in a point in the movie so that you can load some shit ?! wtf !? ... we have progressed so much that we have space travel, but we have not yet exceeded 1.44megabytes of space ..? <br /> <br /> I suppose I'm just asking too much. <br /> <br /> Question two, Let's just say ... that yes ... this is a softcore porn. So why is there only ONE real sex scene, and why does it last for 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you're taking REASON people are standing in the middle of the night to see this shit (dare I say "movie" more?) ... and reduce it to 2 minutes. Hell, they should have taken that sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they'd STILL earn more money from this "shit" than they had. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is warm. And no offense for the actress, but she acts as well as me. and I'm mentally retarded, and I only have a testicle ... (C. Cortigan, ... send me an e-mail ... we'll have lunch) I'll write more, but I've run out of space.
