I saw this movie last night. Usually I don't comment good or bad, because I think that movies are like books because there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes vary, yadda yadda. This film was bad. In the end I thought, oh my, this is testing my patience. How many women really seem to live this way when they touch their asses and if I could borrow some money from my mom and bring my dreams of fashion design to life - God, life would be great! I was out for a good movie with my girlfriend (my dear husband loves watching movies together and I knew it wouldn't be his genre), something light and easy in the senses, but this was a bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting film observers and this film was not that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she held her. Bad. Bad.
