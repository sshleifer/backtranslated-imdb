A film very, very, very slow, aimlessly, about a young man in trouble, adrift. I don't know who was more lost: the flat characters or the audience, almost half of whom came out. <br /> <br /> The attempt to reach the point of view of black and white and of the intelligent camera angles, the disappointed film, has become even more ridiculous, since the acting was scarce and the plot and lines almost non-existent . Very little music or something to talk about. The best scene of the film was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that goes through his head. He goes to a record store used to buy it for his lover and has to sing the song for two salespeople before finding the album. The cute scene promised, but it went downhill from there. The rest of the film lacks art, charm, meaning ... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty. I lost two hours.
