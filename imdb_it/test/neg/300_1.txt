Jefferey Dahmer was a sick boy. There's not much to say about him that hasn't already been said, except that the many documentaries and films made on him are probably better than this. It's ridiculously cheese. It's so poor, a guy who posted the entire movie on youtube added some notes to make the viewer laugh. <br /> <br /> Carl Crew (Who's he?) He plays the serial killer Jeffrey dahmer, who is killing the homicidal madness in 1978 with a young dahmer boy, he just wanted to be friends, finally in 1991 with a man he wanted sex and eating. <br /> <br /> I didn't bother watching the whole movie. it's basically a documentary that shows all the attacks that Dahmer made before being discovered. And since this film was released in 1993, a year before Dahmer was shot to death by an inmate, Dasher's death is not shown. but it probably would have been a cheese like this cheese festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
