Reading most of the other reviews, I tend to agree with most of the comments. The only thing I would like to add is the disjointed way in which the film was directed and produced. I think some of these new wave film producers believe they are smart using unusual camera angles (sometimes jerky) and fluttering from one scene to another. It goes very well with these film festivals, and with some of these Indie type critics, but it ruins the film for me. I noticed in the reviews, a comment that said that none of these film makers has become a success. This would perhaps prove my point, since the film has that 'hurried to finish' feeling that makes you wonder why such a beautiful film seems to lack a regular flow. As for the comment on the fact that Kiefer Sutherland is a big name to put on the poster, I would bet he was hurt when he saw the finale. This is a story with real potential, ruined by the attempt to be different in its production. It is worth looking at, but not many would return for a second viewing.
