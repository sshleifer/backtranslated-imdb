I don't think I've seen a horror movie so bad since ... hell, I don't think I've ever seen such a bad horror movie. Acting alone was enough to make one shudder. Bad acting has gone far beyond the horror genre. It was just awful. And did you see those terrible special effects? When the demon (who looked more like a cheaply built puppet) came out of the wall, I couldn't tell if I should be scared or fucked. Being a big fan of the horror genre, this film was more than slightly disappointing. I couldn't help but notice that the director is from Portland, OR, which seems to be my hometown. I must say that I am deeply ashamed. If I could, I'd give a negative film at 500.
