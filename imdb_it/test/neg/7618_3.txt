Once I saw a bit of this film, and I was interested in seeing the whole thing just to see why the critics gave it two stars, the result is that I agree. Basically the film starts with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) who tells all his muppet friends that they have lost everything, and ends up sitting depressed (and perhaps thinking about suicide) on the bench. Meanwhile, in another world (Heaven) the angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been in Muppets from Space) visits the "Boss" (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason I wanted to see the film) to show that Kermit really needs help. In flashbacks, shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and best Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared one theater show for many people to see in the Christmas holidays, and everything seems to be going well. But the real meaning is that Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to close the show or the theater, and Kermit is doing everything she can to make sure this doesn't happen. Of course, Kermit fails the last time, and Bitterman tells him they are finished and that he can officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's guardian angel to try to help him, but Kermit is not in the right mood and ends up saying "I wish I had never been born". Obviously, you can recognize the parody of It's a Wonderful Life, with Kermit in the role of George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, of course, Kermit understands how much it means for everyone and goes back to looking for the theater saved as a historical landmark . He also played Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Bar as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only character that looks similar to the Oz version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is spoofing on the stage of the Moulin Rouge, in addition to the one and the faces known in it, not fantastic. He was named Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". The Muppets were number 47 in The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Adequate!
