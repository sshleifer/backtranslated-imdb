Dr. Chopper begins shortly after Nicholas's (Robert Adamson) mother died, is still cut, but every cloud has a silver lining and in this case it appears that his mother owns a cottage on Lake Tatonka, the self-proclaimed ' friendly place for happy people 'she didn't tell him about. So Nicholas and his girlfriend Jessica (Chelsey Crisp) and three friends, Jimmy (Butch Hansen), Reese (Chase Hoyt) and Tamara (Ashley McCarthy) leave for a fun weekend. Unfortunately things don't go according to plan, the cabin turns out to be little more than a ruined warehouse and their neighbors turn out to be Dr. Chopper (and the brigadier) and his two nurses who go around killing anyone they meet to use in horrible experiments ... <br /> <br /> Go-to-video / DVD Dr. Chopper was edited and directed by Lewis Schoenburn and this film seems to have difficulties in IMDb on IMDb hard reviews, while I think that Dr. Chopper as a horror film is rather useless, I don't think some of the criticisms I've read are entirely justified. The script that takes itself very seriously is attributed to Ian Holt (whether he likes it or not ...) who has a role in the film as Detective Crocker according to the IMDb cast list although I don't remember any character of that name, maybe was he one of the policemen at the beginning? However, the basic story is fine, I suppose that, even if it's a bit boring and lasts too long, it's a typical racing pot with some kind of evil character that goes around destroying our annoying American teen cast, now you know the drill. In addition to some brief and undeveloped nonsense about Dr. Chopper who uses body parts to reconstitute his deteriorating body, there is not much history here and the script seems to exist only to invent situations where girls take off their shoulders, there are the inevitable sex scenes, there is a sequence in which some girls have to complete the initiation of the house of topless sisters and even here there are also a couple of lesbians, one of whom is seen without her complete compliment of clothes. Oh, and when I say topless, I mean they don't wear tops but keep their bras, so you should keep in mind that there is no real frontal nudity of Dr. Chopper. So you really do have it, it's a medium story that has a slightly surprising touch at the end, which is wasted, it's populated by poor dumb and bad characters that exist only to show some cold-blooded scenes and girls in bras. To be honest, I expect a little more from my films, but then again, I'm just a little fussy. <br /> <br /> Director Schoenburn does really well, this is by no means the worst movie I've seen even though it still seems cheap. There is no style here, I didn't think it was scary and not even the atmosphere. The blood is limited and limited to dead bodies and cut limbs, there is nothing new here or particularly convincing special effects. Dr. Chopper is also one of those films in which the characters' decisions and motivations are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Technically this is a bit rough, but it's reasonably well done on what was probably a really low budget, the forest locations are appropriately isolated, even if the cops' office looks like a room on the in front and the two nurse's uniforms at the beginning look like stripper dresses. The acting is fine, it could have better but I have definitely seen worse. <br /> <br /> Dr. Chopper actually has a doctor who runs around on a chopper bike but unfortunately it's not enough to satisfy me, despite being a reasonably competent production, the lack of a real blood, nudity or plot decent sinks without a trace.
