Looking at the evaluations one might suppose that this is a classic, but once again it is just another example of poor independent filmmakers trying to arouse interest in their film. Are they not even smart about 10/10 in the votes? I imagine to cancel the curve and compensate for all the 1/10 you will get. Is it better than any decent zombie movie? No. <br /> <br /> Acting, banal and garbage. <br /> <br /> Sound effects, cheap and unpleasant, if it were not for the place where the actors looked at you, you wouldn't know where it was coming from. <br /> <br /> Cinematography. These people behave as if they had borrowed their daddy's camera immediately after seeing the matrix. Less is more, but more than this team is absolutely crazy. <br /> <br /> Even zombies are rubbish. I do not doubt that most of these people will never be heard again, and it will be for good reason. I hope the zombies eat their eyes since it's 90 minutes of Dad I'm not coming back. <br /> <br /> And the falsification of the votes makes it a million times worse. <br /> <br /> Has a reviewer said that it was one of the best horror films you've seen in the last 30 years? I can only assume that his recent corneal transplant was a success. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer as a warning about how bad this movie is.
