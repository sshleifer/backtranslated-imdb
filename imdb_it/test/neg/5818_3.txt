This is the story of a news investigator who hates his work - which shows why the actors - even weak ones like Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors aren't! <br /> Tell us this though - the best moments show some basics to be really fun (not just extravagant), to keep trying, maybe take lessons and use the time to continue learning how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's My Car" and the "Scary Movie" sequence have all this ... college attempt.) <br /> <br /> Lighting no; production was not; and the script had moments (the conversation from space - very nice, try with unconvincing execution). (This reminded me of "Dark Star" - which means being "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost. <br /> <br /> The talent was the bartender (he said "dog" so annoyingly that I knew that he had to act ... isn't he? ... he's acting now!), Mark Hammond's boyfriend and Marty, I think I gave the film a point for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> < br /> -LD <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
