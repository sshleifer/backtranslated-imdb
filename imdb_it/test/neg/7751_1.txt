This film is a bizarre fantasy story, which I am sure nobody likes more than 10, but it's too weird for kids. The plot is stupid and acting is among the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 25-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who acts like a 9-year-old girl. It seems he got his character's voice by listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. His high-pitched, shrill voice becomes annoying the moment he starts talking. All the other acting is bad, but actually Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The plot is also terrible and is a sort of mix between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussemm (Ireland) receives a letter saying that her father, who left it a long time ago, fell into a bottomless pit in Africa, and when he goes to look for it, he falls into an underground world full of strange accented Australian characters. It's one of the bravest movies you've ever seen, with terrible lines everywhere. <br /> <br /> The effects that this film uses for character development are annoying. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who will do nothing or go anywhere. She flies to Africa .... wow, what a development! She drops her glasses and then doesn't need them. Because dropping your glasses represents them by not becoming a nerd. It should represent his descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I can think of is that there are semi-good special effects and camera work, and the musical score sounds good. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will appeal only to those who don't expect anything from a movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 on ****. 84 minutes PG for violence.
