Exhilarating inept - like "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon" redone by five-year-olds. <br /> <br /> Forward Spoiler: Despite the title and the large number of people, "Slaughter Trail" is actually a musical with Injun battles instead of dance numbers. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood could have done with a budget for B movies, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions may have been bad only in retrospect, such as the filming of the short-lived Cinecolor process, which caused the change of tone within the same shot. But there was certainly some inconsiderate skimping on the main set of the film, a cavalry fort that appears to be partly a Norman castle. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Bare Necessities" for Disney's "The Jungle Book", provides a score full of original songs that would have been wonderful for a cartoon, but that suited the Western action like a fuzzy slipper stuck in a stirrup. A song tells how "the horses' hooves beat, and their melody sounds, like the serenade of hooves" ... during a scene of a seriously dead cavalry patrol. Other songs literally narrate the story taken, introducing characters, describing their moods and their gestures - as they happen on the screen - and even stopping to publicize the Cinecolor process (!) <br /> <br /> <br /> The script sends fierce Navajos the war path to avenge the killing of two of their band by an outlaw trio. At the end of the film, what looks like a hundred Navajo and cavalry bit the dust (thanks to the repeated shots of the same characters dying again and again.) But the head is satisfied when he sees the trio of villains being killed. While the singer helpfully informs those of us who were not paying attention, the Navajos leave, their battle has been canceled. The cavalry captain, surrounded by the corpses of his fallen comrades, cheerfully greets his appreciation. <br /> <br /> The management could be more charitably described as wood, or more precisely, Wood-en. The Navajo are constantly slaughtered with their horses in pairs - never just one. Virtually every red man on foot dies throwing his hands in the air and climbing over. The film also employs the most cautious Hollywood stuntmen, who squat before leaving a one-story roof (and still can't hold on) or turn to look behind them as they slip "dead" down a rocky slope. br /> <br /> The star is Brian Donlevy, who certainly deserves an Oscar for not blushing. After the interminable final scene of the battle - "climax" is barely the word - scan a list of dozens of his soldiers killed and shrugs, "It could have been MUCH worse." The soldier Andy Devine arrives to sing and the thief / assassin Gig Young laughs at the antics of Andy ... who leads a character who had been held up by masked bandits to Rat out: "I could laugh anywhere!" <br /> <br /> And if someone forgets what could be a bad job Howard Hughes remembers that as head of the RKO, Hughes was the first in line to blacklist star Howard Da Silva when HUAC denounced him. Hughes would have taken another six years to finish the once celebrated studio on the ground, but he didn't help things when he insisted on reprogramming every scene of Da Silva for this film, replacing Donlevy. <br /> <br /> It was almost a decade before Da Silva could return to work in Hollywood. But all in all, to get him out of "Slaughter Trail", he would have to send Hughes a thank you note.
