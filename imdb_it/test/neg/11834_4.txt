The script of the Broadway success in the comedy "The Gay Divorce" (a title considered too scandalous for American viewers, although used in the UK) concerns a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) who meet in embarrassing circumstances while you are in the process of divorcing your spouse; they dance, quarrel, make up, dance, argue again and dance a little more. Betty Grable is very attractive in a short distance (singing and dancing in the "Let's K-nee K-nees" issue with Edward Everett Horton openly sissified), but the pair of stars seem distressed and unhappy all the time. The surroundings are sophisticated, but the characters are no more than one dimension. * 1/2 from ****
