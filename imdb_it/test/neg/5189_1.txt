About 20 minutes in this awkward excuse for a movie, I realized that it reminded me of one of those annoying people at work who always say jokes or jokes or extremely unpleasant things, because they think it's funny and they're trying to entertain everyone. <br /> <br /> This film is played as played by Traci Lords, not so bad as an actress, but her lines are not funny and NOT THE STAR <br /> <br /> Acting is a bit the most terrible I've ever seen, except Lord, the girl who plays Casey and maybe the Colonel, who looks strangely out of place. I can't imagine why a retired military colonel wants to start a SNOWBOARD ACADEMY. Does anyone even exist? <br /> <br /> The budget would have been better spent, prompting these women to make a full porn movie. <br /> <br /> "Freddy Got Fingered" currently has a score of 3.5, "Frostbite" has a 2.7. I am baffled that these two films are located at a distance of 1.0, FGF is "The Godfather" compared to this garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars
