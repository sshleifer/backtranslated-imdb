The film is about a day in the life of a woman who is going crazy. To prove that she is mentally ill, she stands above her and the narrator tells us that she is "going crazy". Along the way, he goes out with a fat boy who seems to be the brother of Orson Welles and later takes the headline of a building in one of the only interesting moments in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a strange little film that is very cheaply made - and it certainly proves it. The film was shot without audio (probably using 8mm or some other kind of cheap film) and had some sound effects and a bully narrative added later. In fact, the narrative was the most intrusive and unintentionally exhilarating I have ever heard and is said in such a foolish and exaggerated way that you should just hear it to believe it. As a result of these cost-cutting actions, it is not surprising that the film is bad, although the idea of ​​trying to make this kind of film was quite original. Furthermore, it is VERY difficult to get past the entire film.
