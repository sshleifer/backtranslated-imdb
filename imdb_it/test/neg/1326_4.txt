People judge this film a lot because it's a foreign war movie ??? <br /> <br /> For me it is nothing but a bad Hollywood war movie in German. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad on so many levels. It is even absurd to talk about Platoon or Full Metal Jacket. The battle sequences are pathetic, the dialogue and recitation are atrocious. <br /> <br /> This so-called group of "assault troops" is regularly visited by the Wermacht. Not SS troops There is so much wrong with this film that it is sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It has everything. <br /> <br /> The film goes on and on and on as if the audience were suffering as much as the soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that this film has a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> Really? Where was it spent? In the train sequences of the false train? In the pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. <br /> <br /> As a fan of World War II history and fond of WWII movies, I found this film a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie, take a look at "The Beast" ". (Not a WWII movie, but still pending) <br /> <br /> Not worry about this.
