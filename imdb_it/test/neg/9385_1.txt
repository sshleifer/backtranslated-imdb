THANKS TO GOD YOU ARE HERE it is painful, positively painful. The title is suitable, in a sense, if it is aimed at the large audience of the studio paid to laugh as if they were looking at the second coming of the Marx brothers. And believe me, they are paid. <br /> <br /> As creatively sterile as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that the NBC brasses really trust this turkey. Rather, I think that THANKS TO GOD THAT YOU ARE HERE is what you get for those who did not look, or did not appreciate STUDIO 60, who had previously honored the Monday night lineup of the peacock net. You want to raise your nose against caviar, well. Here are some delicious Alpo directly from Menu Foods to let you slide inside.
