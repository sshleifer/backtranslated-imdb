The science fiction channel thinks this is science fiction; it's a shame. Big Bugs, Snakes, Mythical Beasties, and so on, persist. <br /> <br /> Someone at Universal had the brains to include BattleStar Galactica (the new, good one) and Firefly for a brief moment in their line up. I know they know the difference between total garbage and high quality science fiction. <br /> <br /> A few years ago they were about how they were all going high and powerful, producing productions that weren't just for us mere, lame or trekkies. Thank you so much, Science Fiction! You know, you make films so bad, even Trekkies won't look at them, so you've reached your goal! Fire Snake, Ice Spiders, Manticore, Larva, etc. And a vast and relentless storm of crap afterwards, and they're still churning out just faster than the latest flu virus! How they do it is beyond my comprehension. Because they do it, I just don't know. How they can ignore these reviews, comments, blogs and e-mails, I don't know, but it's clear they don't think much of their audience or care about our opinions! They seem to think that this is what science fiction fans want! You would think that one or two good productions with a certain sense would creep when anyone turned on green lights, this stuff was on vacation. At least they are using the Misfit toy collection; many of the sci-fi films of the week, the actors were in science fiction shows once and now they need money. I love you, and I hope you can get a better job!
