"Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for a movie. I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen "Because of Winn-Dixie" instead. I have to say that it's partly my fault, since I agreed to go and see him with him. Being a fan of the first movie "Mask" (Jim Carrey was hilarious) I had hoped it wasn't as bad as all the critics said it was. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes into the film I knew it was headed for disaster. Disgusting and useless attempts to be funny, seven and eight-year-old children screamed with laughter, but the rest of us remained staring at the incredulous screen. <br /> <br /> Finding the film as repulsive and unpleasant was surprising to me as well, as I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two films that many people I know have found crude and offensive. But the fact is that "Son of the Mask" is not fun unless you are less than ten years old. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a lot of CGI, but it can't save this piece of junk. Anyone who allowed this film to reach the big screen probably thought it had potential, considering the success of the original. Unfortunately, he has none of the laughter, fun or excitement of the first, creating a mockery of the original film. I recommend renting the original "Mask" to anyone thinking of seeing it. 1 out of 10 stars is generous with this terrible mess.
