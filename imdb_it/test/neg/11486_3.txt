throughout the history of cinema, there have been some films that have deceived the viewer, such as hitchcock's "stage fright", "abre los ojos" by alejandro amen√°bar, "the game" by David Fincher and this "ausentes" (" absent"). for a start, I don't like this kind of film, I feel like someone was trying to rip my leg off. <br /> <br /> moreover, after seeing this film you don't know what happened, it's such a confusing movie. Kubrick's "shining" could be a better or worse film, but it is certainly more honest than this load of pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> technically it is beautiful: good photography, good performance and so on, but the script is so poor that I wonder what the producers have seen continue to shoot this scene. <br /> <br /> and this film notes that the 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the cinema trying to make a masterpiece -or trying to do something to satisfy the stomach, waiting of more personal projects.
