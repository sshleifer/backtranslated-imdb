Masters Horror: Sounds Like is set in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as director of a computer software call center, having lost his 6-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) in a rare heart condition, he discovered he had ultra-hearing -sensibile. Larry hears everything in ten times, from the people who type computer keyboards, the people who whispered across the room, the people who touch their feet on the floor, the dripping taps and finally even the people who breathe become unbearable for Larry while he is constantly bombarded by penetrating noises. In the end Larry decides to have had enough and if he can't stop the noises alone, then maybe he can stop himself from listening to them with the help of a great intelligent flesh ... <br /> <br /> This American Canadian co-production is It was episode 4 of the second season of the hit TV series Masters of Horror, written and directed by Brad Anderson, who thought Sounds Like was a real shortcoming. The script was based on a story by Mike O'Driscoll and I am genuinely surprised by the amount of very positive comments he has here about the Annual right now, to begin with it would be very difficult to even describe it as a horror movie and it looks more like a bizarre drama sentimental until the last 5 minutes when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the KNB effects guys can really do some work. Larry has this strange, inexplicable ability to amplify sounds and noises from the start, so this episode ends for 55 minutes exactly the same kind of repetitive build that leads to a bloody ending even if it comes late to save the episode. This is rather slow and, although it is well written, it is not meant to be horror-themed and I'm a bit confused about who should appeal to this? <br /> <br /> Director Anderson does OK but he just keeps repeating the same things over and over again, until the last 5 minutes there's not a single drop of blood in the whole thing. There is no horror, there is no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically this is very well done, has good production values ​​and does not look like a cheap made-for-TV program. Actually, acting is very good and it's a shame that the story is a bit limited. <br /> <br /> Sounds Like is one of the worst episodes of Masters of Horror, many people seem to like it and it's okay, but it's definitely not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
