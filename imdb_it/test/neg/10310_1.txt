Oh boy! Oh boy! On the cover of the worn VHS has a picture of Sandra Bullock and her name written above. I think the only reason they got the chance to sell the movie in the nineties was because of the name of Sandra Bullock. Bullock fans don't have to disappoint. Sandra is the only thing to see in this film and her performance is the only one you can call acting. Rest of the movie ?? It's fun to watch it in the first fifteen minutes because it's ugly, but then it's worse. Much worse. Directing is terrible. Acting is terrible. The script is terrible. The dialogue is horrible. The action is terrible. The music is actually pretty good. Typical score for action films of the eighties. This film is so bad that it comes close to anything that Andy Sidaris has ever produced. It is so bad that there is no appropriate word to describe this poor attempt to be a film. But still, there was Sandra Bullock. And super cool (sarcasm) Jake LaMotta who tried to be Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> I think they can now bring the movie to DVD. It could be nice! And they should write on the cover: ACADEMY AWARD WINNER SANDRA BULLOCk IN HANGMEN <br /> <br /> 1 in 10
