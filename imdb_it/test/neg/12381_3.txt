This is how cheese they come ?? the concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too laborious for words, but wait until you get a load of the stupid creature as it appears on the screen! I tell you, did I laugh so much through this thing that I missed out on some of the exhibition dialogues ?? then again, the second is often so heavy for scientific jargon and the laws of physics and the like (in which I've never been good, despite my love for science fiction films) that absolutely didn't matter! The bird ?? first depicted as a simple fuzzy shape darting through the skies, but later shown in all its oppressive glory ?? it's so incredibly stupid that he wouldn't be wrong in a Looney Tunes cartoon (testifies to the series of intermittently taken photographs that start with the creature in the distance and end up in an extreme close-up that splits his side)! <br /> <br /> Director Sears went much better with his other UFO film, the beautiful EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS (1956) ?? with special effects provided by a master, Ray Harryhausen (speaking of this, I have just given away my copy of the latter pending the acquisition of the recently published DVD SE); moreover, it seems to me that some of the images that illustrate the fury of the bird in New York here have been removed from the destruction of Washington seen in that classic sci-fi! Once again, the protagonists are interpreted by genre regulars ?? namely Jeff Morrow (from THIS ISLAND EARTH [1955]) and Mara Corday (from TARANTULA [1955]); as with the aforementioned FLYING AIRCRAFT, are these titles much appreciated and loved by fans? consequently, they are far superior to this deplorable addition to the prevailing alien / monster animal cycle during the period of sci-fi glory and beyond (incidentally, other flying threats have been reported in THE FLYING SERPENT [1946], which I have not seen, and Larry Cohen improved his version in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, THE GIANT CLAW can't even achieve a decent climax ?? which is so hasty as to be "a wash-out", to name a jet pilot of the same film whose rocket assault on the bird proves to be completely ineffective (ie, before Morrow realizes he is protected by an invisible barrier and then to understand how to be able to penetrate it). Ultimately, apart from the intractable (and frankly boring) technical arguments, one perceives "so bad, it's good" looking at this: after all, it only lasts 74 minutes ?? and, in any case, the bird is a creation so ruthless that it goes crazy to make you smile every time!
