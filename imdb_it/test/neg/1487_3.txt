The presentation is VERY dreary. (in my opinion) as documentaries often are. The "documenatria" of Michael Moore - Farenheit 911 is much more convincing but has FAR too many media and political influence. I look forward to Saturday to see the docudrama "The game of their lives". IFC goes to the right of the center. I started a collection of IFC movies from the Internet due to "TGOTL" *** on ********** on "Decade". Want to see good documentaries? Follow the chronological channel .. Or try docudrama. You can't go wrong with their friend of mine. I can't go wrong. The seventies were ten years of replicas. Or so the old days should have made you believe. Disco is dead and disappeared forever. When Elvis died or yes, we were all saddened
