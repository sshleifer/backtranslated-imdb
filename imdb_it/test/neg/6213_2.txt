This film was recommended to me so we went to see it together. I wouldn't call it a movie, it's more a combination of 10 different unfinished and illogical stories, which aren't all that funny. There are several characters in the film that seemed important in the beginning, and they simply disappeared from the story. He's just trying to adapt to everything in two and a half hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy. <br /> <br /> I think this film is just an extended version of "Hitch", full of characters and dances. <br /> <br /> If this is the best film that this pair has ever made, then I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in any of its previous ones.
