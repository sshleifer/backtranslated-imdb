And it's a not very good documentary or the American MOVIE seems to have confused some people in thinking that this is a smuggling documentary ("Mockumentary") and also some newspaper TV ads describe it as such, because it's easy to confuse this documentary as a great wing shot THIS IS SPINAL TOUCH <br /> <br /> What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary focuses on the budding director Mark Borchardt who is .... How can you say that yes, but it is not necessarily a bad thing, because if we had no dreams, we would still live in caves and the fact that Mark is obsessed with horror movies should not be taken as a criticism since it is Sam Raimi ( Yes that one) that Peter Jackson (yes that) have both started making low budget horror comedies, so again it's not a criticism. It's not just that Mark Borchardt (yes that) is a parody of American trailer trash. > <br /> Remember HERE IS SOMETHING BUT RY Ben Stiller gives a ride to a deceitful hiker ("Come to my office because you're fucked" fired ")? Well, here's who Mark looks like most of Jerry Springer's guests, so it's very easy to see why some people thought this wasn't a real documentary. Also, it's not a good documentary since Mark and Co give me the creeps. Did you know that someone thought that Mark would become a serial killer? Does anyone else think there's a long time left for this?
