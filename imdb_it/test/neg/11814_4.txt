If you find the acting hopelessly amateur, the story uninteresting, the fake blood and all the senseless disappearances bearable, then you could really spend some time watching this poorly exploited and cheap movie. You might also want to take a look at a pretty good catfight sequence that is offered, even if it's not good enough to get the rest of the movie through. (**)
