Before starting, let me take something from my chest: I'm a big fan of John Eyres' first film PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, a B-level cross from THE TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a film genius, but it is an extremely entertaining action film that has become a cult (and has generated two sequels and a spin off) . br /> <br /> Judge and Jury begins with Joseph Meeker, a convicted killer who was sent to Death Row after his capture after the so-called "Bloody Shootout" (which seems a poor name for a murderous madness ??? kills three people trying to rob a grocery store), being taken to the electric chair. Is there a funny scene where Meeker talks to the priest of life by sex, but meets his only true love (who was killed during the shooting), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her ?? Michael Silvano, a football star who spends his days watching his son Alex while he plays soccer with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach). But once executed, Meeker returns as a revenant (or as Kelly Perine calls "a hamburger without chips"), whose sole purpose is to get his revenge, which basically means making Silvano's life a misery. <br /> <br /> Let me emphasize the fact that Judge and Jury is not a real horror movie. It is a supernatural action movie, with Meeker chasing Silvano, using his ability to change shape (which is equivalent to David Keith who disguises himself as an Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with a bad accent like his mustache) ), a drag queen, a clown and a stand-up comedian), a shotgun that fires explosive shots and an invulnerability to death (even if this does not prevent Martin Kove from shooting Keith with a desert eagle), to repay Silvano for killing Meeker's wife. br /> <br /> Director John Eyres does not seem interested in characterization, focusing instead only on action scenes, which the film has in abundance. But this is the main flaw of the film, since there is nothing to link the action scenes together. The acting is surprisingly good, with Keith offering the best performance, ably supported by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays the washed cop quite well. Kelly Perine is as annoying as the taxi driver who tries to help but makes the situation worse.
