STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br /> <br /> Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal - not so bad as an actor like Kevin Costner but ....... aaaaahhhh, you understand) is a modern Robin Hood (listen closely, you can hear the music of Brian Adams in the background ... no, not really), the kind of boy who steals money from illicit blood coming from drug dealers and using it to keep shabby orphanages open. But now he has been contacted to drive a van escape in a Las Vegas robbery in one of those last things before retirement jobs. But of course, everything goes wrong and he ends up with patsy for the big boys on top and in prison. Here he meets a boy named (although you wouldn't know how to pay attention to the film) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he makes a friendship and ends up leaving prison. Once free, he is out to prove his innocence, locate the missing money and, of course, get even those who set him up! <br /> <br /> Of all the recent Seagal films on video, Today You Die has that look more than anything that belongs to a cinema, even with a rap star as co-star as his previous films Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, it seems that when he's not making films about environmental care, he's pretending to be black and co-starring with rappers. But TYD is not a cinema film and this is a luxury The Great One will never have fun again until Under Siege 3 materializes (if ever!) <br /> <br /> The film opens with a smooth look and polished that commands attention but everything goes downhill quickly from there. Once Seagal hits the prison, the plot quickly loses its consistency. Indeed, the character of Treach seems to pop out of nowhere without any introduction as his helper and from there he quickly loses interest in it. <br /> <br /> Done. I know I said it before, but I think I want to say it this time. I don't think I'll give more of these films straight to Seagal at any time. Honestly, I have no enthusiasm for watching Shadow Man. In fact, I can honestly say that until now I have never enjoyed ANY of his STV movies, and Today You Die is certainly no exception, a boring, apathetic, all in all, avoided effort from everyone. *
