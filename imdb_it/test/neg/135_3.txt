I loved the first 1/3 of this movie and thought it would be one of Truffaut's best films. I loved the plot in which a pen pal marries a man of half the world - the unseen sight. Especially when this woman turns out to be a fraud and was responsible for the death of the true pen pal so that she could take her place! He then cleaned up her husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really passionate and wanted to see more, ... <br /> <br /> And then, the film fell apart and became simply stupid! Although she comes from New Caledonia (a Pacific island) and he from Reunion (an island in the Indian Ocean), when she travels to the south of France, she runs off almost immediately. Hmm, .... the odds are 187,000,000 to 1, but he finds it. Then, instead of killing her or giving her to the police, she forgives her - even when she recognizes what she did. Okay, it's hard to believe, but okay ... but then help hide it from a private detective by killing him !!!! No one is so stupid! Yes, the character played by Catherine Deneuve is quite beautiful, but come on, guys, this is simply silly. Furthermore, if he wanted it only as a sexual object, then why would he do it for a woman who is often frigid, completely selfish and evil. <br /> <br /> This film, because of its very ridiculous plot, does not deserve such high marks! Unless you're an avid Truffaut fan, try another movie - even Truffaut's - just NOT that.
