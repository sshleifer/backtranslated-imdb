No that he is sick. He is not sick. It made me want to vomit because I spent 2 dollars. It's boring, delayed and annoying. I didn't see the MST3K version, which sucks because I bet the MST3K version was fun. It's sad that people waste money on these types of films. I'm surprised it's not in the "100 worst movies of all time". <br /> <br /> TromaDude's Rating- 0 outta ***** stars
