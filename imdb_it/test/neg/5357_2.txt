What can you say after watching this movie? That is, if you had the interest and concentration to see it until the end. I was speechless, because of the incredibly boring story, the annoying situations in which an American was equal to that of a fifty or more Iraqis and a boring dialogue. I think if this movie has something to teach, it probably says "Don't mess with the United States, or we'll kick your asses." Furthermore, this film really encourages and votes for the killing of masses of foreigners, in the name of war. I got the picture of facing chess on the board. Except that now it's fast and there's not much to think about. And what's more ... no character has a spirit; then, how can you take care of everything that happens to any of them. Excluding fans of war movies without taste, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There should always be something more interesting to do.
