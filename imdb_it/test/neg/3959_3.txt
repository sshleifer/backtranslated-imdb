The word honor should be erased from the vocabularies of all nations. It aggravates male stupidity and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. Anyone who disagrees should not worry about continuing to read this comment. <br /> <br /> As can be expected of these writers, Yakuza is a thrilling crime thriller with a certain respect for the ethnic background against which he is acted. Even friends of blood and violence will not be disappointed, but above all towards the end violence becomes somehow useless, redundant and even foolish. Unlike other reviewers, I found that Robert Mitchum's performance is not very good. This is an actor who certainly has not improved with age. He looks like a tired janitor (he doesn't do very well with the part), and his air of detachment that made him such an impressive film presence in previous years goes through confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as men of honor and young, intelligent, who feel like punks respectively. <br /> <br /> The best way to play this film is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by Mitchum's character who asks Takakura's character for a favor based on wrong assumptions. The mistake soon becomes clear, but the sense of honor requires that they should not retreat. So they start running furtively, shooting in all directions, wielding their swords and destroying their friend's artistic apartment (even if the guy begs them, please stop "through the corresponding fight.) The bodies start to accumulate and the story ends with Mitchum character who makes his point: If you give him your little finger, I'll give you my MINT, well, it's the least you can do, isn't it? So take out a knife, take a resigned breath start sawing off the end (out of frame, thankfully) It was a moment that probably should have been solemn, it just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of locations is very good in I particularly liked the scenes shot in and around the International Conference Hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachio Otani (the Kyoto protocol was signed there) For me the presentation of the arc hitettura looks better here than in Sydney Pollack's most recent documentary Sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.
