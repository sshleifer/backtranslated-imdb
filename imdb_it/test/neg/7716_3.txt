If you have not seen the first one, you must at least know someone who has and you must know that it was painful to sit down. There was nothing good to say about it. So what's different with the latter? Why bother creating a sequel to a movie that was unhappy? This is not taken too seriously. He knows it was created for TV and doesn't try to impress with big or serious dialogues. There are times when you try to become "serious" or "intense" but these moments are so trivial that you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately it is all elements of Uwe Boll and every indication that this was born from a video game (besides the title of course). Don't go in this movie waiting for something worth mentioning to your friends unless they are on the pitch, zombie zombies or they are interested in making a drinking game of this movie. Make two shots each time the Ed Quinn character mentions his dead brother! Take a shot every time a bullet would have been a better place in a zombie's head instead of pumping three in the chest! etc. etc
