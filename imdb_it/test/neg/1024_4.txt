Honestly an effort that achieves some success to adapt the classic story of Odyssey to a period piece of nostalgia for the 1930s. The adventurers this time are escaped prisoners, wandering through the Depression that afflicts South, which makes its way into trouble. <br /> <br /> The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful soundtrack, effectively evoking not only the era that is set in, but the spiritual references that are rampant in the film. In addition to its value for the tone of the film, the music is simply fun to listen to. <br /> <br /> What paralyzes the film is that the characters are not so nice. In a comedy, you need that element to have fun with them in their misadventures. Instead, we have a bunch of selfish, arrogant, soulless, petty noblemen, who actually have no positive point. They are not impressive enough to make you hate, so it's hard to identify with them. They are offered as clowns, but like people who stage clown makeup and parade in parades, they are not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Like the story that inspired it, the film takes these kids on an "odyssey", meeting a variety of symbolic characters (some even mystics). All are imprinted with offensive stereotypes, the operative term is "stupid". People are derided left and right, and as a result, no one is left particularly interesting or attractive. The film doesn't like its characters, and you don't like them either. <br /> <br /> Baptisms on the river, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fistfights, radio preachers, people whipped with sticks; all of them are launched separately. Some evoke some laughter, others confuse or bore. I laughed when a nerdy boy beat the snot of a particularly hateful lead character. But there were many unnecessarily free scenes; an example: a Dillinger type from the 1930s tears cows with a machine gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; only senseless violence, which takes away the intellectual nature of the original material of which this story is inspired. <br /> <br /> Other adaptations of the Odyssey are much better. If you are not a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy the CD of the soundtrack; the music is fantastic.
