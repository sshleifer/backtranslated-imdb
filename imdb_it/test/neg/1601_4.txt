I couldn't wait to watch "Wirey Spindell" since it happened in Schaffer's "Fall". Unfortunately, I found the "WS" as a bunch of wandering, non-engaging and boring claptrap, put together with what is apparently Schaeffer's signature, a mixture of history, storytelling and poetry. The film tells the sexual experiences and other experiences of a man from Manhattan about to be married through self-narrated flashbacks. Like beads on a string, Schaffer seems to have put together all the little experiences of sexual life, while neglecting the beauty of the necklace. The result is a rambling untidy story of a boy who grows up and who fails to generate empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, dissatisfied and with a bad taste that fades the mechanical ending. A mediocre indie and a step backwards for Schaeffer.
