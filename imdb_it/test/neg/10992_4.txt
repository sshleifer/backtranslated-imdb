You know, this is one of those "Emperor's new clothes" movies. It is so, so out of the wall and strange that you are supposed to like it if you are really interested in cinema. Well, I think it's some mortadella. Films like this that hide under Dada's cloak or surrealism make me mad. Someone has this bad dream, perhaps brought to eat the aforementioned bologna just before going to bed, remembers most of it (unfortunately) and then puts it on film and we should all marvel at their creative genius. I too have bizarre dreams at times that absolutely make no sense, but I don't feel the need to put them on the film, expose them to everyone else and call them art. The strangeness itself means that something is interesting. The true Dadaist or surreal expression has some intent and intellectual thought behind it. If other people do not understand, this does not make it profound, it simply makes it incomprehensible. The oddness for the taste of the bizarre, for me, is not good, if not exceptional, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" to "Delicatesen" is like comparing "The Godfather I & II" to "The Godfather III" --- the same genre, NOT in the same league.
