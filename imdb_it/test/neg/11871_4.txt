Let's just say one thing: I really like Snipes' work. Unlike his other high-level peers (Seagal and Van Damme), he can actually act. However, this film does little to improve its reputation; it's not exactly unwatchable, but I'm not even in a hurry to see it again. In fact, if you had never seen it again, it wouldn't bother me - there are just a lot of better movies out there to waste mine! It's a shame because with a little imagination and some small changes this could have been a remarkable film. Instead the director has chosen to try almost to hit the public with too many exaggerated violations and with very little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with Snipes co-star, Silvia Colloca. It baffles me that the producers of this film had all the hassle of assuming a splendid beauty (for my money anyway) and a talented actress like Miss Colloca and then giving her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with. If she was hired to simply add a little "glamor" to the film, she doesn't do it very well either; there is no nudity in the film or even sex scenes worth mentioning. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this film, it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. Are we living in 2007 or 1957? What the producers of this garbage (and probably the actors) have forgotten is that the films are meant to be fantasies. Like most of the inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I would like to be on the hunt for terrorists, be able to handle myself like Mr Snipes and make friends with a young and beautiful girl like Miss Colloca. This film does not satisfy these fantasies very well. That's why I'm giving this negative review!
