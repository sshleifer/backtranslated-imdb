The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" to 2 instead of 1 is because the two main actors are good, and it wasn't shot on VHS. History, dialogue and plot are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Speaking / guiding the zombies who return to vote and influence the political wave against the war! Give me a break! What then, zombies returning to parachuting? Perhaps the zombies who return to host QVC shows? <br /> <br /> I have never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful as it mocks the TRUE horror of war. <br /> <br /> With the mass-produced zombies in today's market ... this is the SPAM of entertainment related to zombies. How "Homecoming" has become "Masters of Horror" is beyond me.
