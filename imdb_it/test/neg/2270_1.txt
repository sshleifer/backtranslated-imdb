The comparisons between the 1995 version and this are inevitable. Unfortunately, this version is very short. <br /> <br /> The casting is not inspired and the acting cast. One gets the impression that the director did not read the book, so he did not understand the characters. <br /> <br /> Sir Walter Elliot is portrayed as pompous, but his unconscious foolishness that Redgrave brilliantly captured (in the 1995 version) is nowhere <br /> <br /> The Musgrove sisters are so unlikely, it is not clear why Wentworth or anyone else could give him a second look. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wentworth and Anne is devoid of feelings. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, Hinds and Root succeeded in conveying the depth of emotion that the two felt towards each other with their body language and facial expressions. In this, it is difficult to understand that Anne spent years mired in regret unless one read the book. <br /> <br /> This production does not capture the emotional complexity of the relationship of the main characters. <br /> <br /> In the scene where Wentworth enters Anne and Mary having breakfast, it seems to the viewer, as Mary thinks, that they are only a few acquaintances. <br /> <br /> In the 1995 version, when Wentworth enters (the first time he has seen it for years), the tension is strong. Resentment is coming out of Wentworth, while Anne is almost outdated. <br /> <br /> In this version, while Wentworth is courting Lousia, it is as if it were really invested, there are no underground currents. In the 1995 version, the viewer sees Wentworth's anger over Anne. He is showing off his courtship in front of Anne, as if to say "look what you gave up, I don't need or I don't want anymore". <br /> <br /> However, he still cares if he suffers, as the scene in which he asks his sister and the admiral to bring Anne back home illustrates. In the 1995 version the viewer perceives the shock of Anne who would care if she was tired, we also feel Wentworth's discomfort that he still cares about. In this version he walks with Lousia as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> The key scene in which Anne is conversing with Harville about those who love longer, man or woman, is totally messed up. Actors only recite sentences without emotional investments. <br /> <br /> When Anne reads Wentworth's letter, it's like she's reading a shopping list. <br /> <br /> Against the 1995 version, in which the spectator perceives Anne's joy at her second chance. We're there with her reading the letter. The director had both actors who read the letter and heard both their voices. Wentworth is full of frustration, passion and hope, while Anne is at first incredulous and then evolves towards joy. <br /> <br /> This production has more scenes after the revelation, probably because it was necessary to explain to the viewer what just happened. The 1995 version needed no explanation, we knew and rejoiced for the characters. The only thing that this production has in its favor is that Mrs. Smith's sub-plot has remained intact, while the 1995 version is not. <br /> <br /> The 1995 version however included part of the original Austen finale. The scene in which Wentworth is commissioned by the admiral to find out if Anne and Mr. Elliot will want to return to his house (which he and Mrs. Croft are renting) after getting married. <br /> <br /> This is a production to be avoided at all costs.
