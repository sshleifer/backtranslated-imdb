This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while I got into the habit of watching awful movies, including "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All these films are cinematic gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> There is not much point in summarizing this piece of junk; I think it is more useful to summarize my reaction to the film, which is as follows: I become furiously angry and I want to rip the tape from the VCR and burn it after about (about) 80 minutes of play. <br /> <br /> I consider this film a 0, but IMDb does not allow to vote a movie less than 1. I give it a 0 knowing perfectly that I am saying that any film that has a score higher than 0 is infinitely (indefinably) many times better than this - It's really that bad.
