Opie, Tom Gilson, was my brother, so I went to see the movie and never looked at it all these years again. Sorry! it was bad They told me that I have to write 10 lines, so I will put some curiosity. Tom and Tuesday Weld had to be "presented" in this picture and Tom was told to take Tuesday at the premiere but Tom said no to Joan Collins, and he did and because he only did Weld Tuesday was introduced. I found this very funny then and I still do it. The movie, while the concept was fun, and the actors were awesome, but some didn't come out funny. The continuity was abstract, at best, it was like looking at two different films at the same time, each one running in the other. I'm sorry, Bob Gilson
