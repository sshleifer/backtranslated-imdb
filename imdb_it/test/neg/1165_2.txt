I have just seen this movie and it turns out to be rather lame, as mentioned by other user reviews and the only thing that bothered me most was the southern accent that some of the characters had, it took place in Wisconsin, not in south. As already mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a great guy, so why does the guy who plays Jason and Leatherface portray him? <br /> <br /> I have taken a step forward in most of what is that there are many slow parts. <br /> <br /> We hope that someone will do the homework on Ed Geine and the city and make a more accurate film
