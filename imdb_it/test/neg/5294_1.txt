I went to the cinema a bit apprehensive, I came out seething with rage for the garbage (going through a movie) to which I had been a witness. Actors, particularly Travolta, should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this. Clearly the only thing in their minds was the control of wages, not to mention the devaluation of their talents and us. Travolta needs to go back to making more movies "Look who's talking" while he's back on the level of his pre-Tarantino work. This is something when LW Talking sequels are better than this. Travolta is no longer the king of Cool, but the king of corn. Michael Caine himself has admitted to having made bad pay movies, Trvolta should follow suit if he has respect for himself!
