This was the most terrifying abuse of the word "comedy" ever seen. It's simply not funny and the writers have obviously tried to use the name of the TV series to make some money at the box office. This film makes it seem insignificant regarding sexual insinuation (it's not a small undertaking), and has all the charisma of a corpse with rigamortis. I'm afraid of a complete washout !!
