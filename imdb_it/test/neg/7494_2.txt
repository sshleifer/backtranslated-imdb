Perhaps it is unfair not to love a film for what it is not, rather than for what it is, but I approached it hoping that finally a director would make a film about gay men and women from small rural towns. Instead, the focus is mainly on the eccentric bigotry (important news!) Of the locals (and those in the peripheral areas) and on the macabre torture / murder of a young gay. <br /> <br /> So much time dedicated to stupid people who complain about AIDS, sin, hellish fire and perverts. So much time dedicated to the macabre preacher who complains about the Bible and gay people get what they deserve. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see more people coming to the "small town gay bar", not the ones I opposed. Moreover, the young man who was murdered does not even come from this city. <br /> <br /> The whole film works as a warning rather than a celebration and is very suspect.
