If this film had been in English, all the critics would have trashed it. The language is extremely negative, the scenes are terribly direct and it's not funny at all. After the film I thought that this film could have been written by a student 8, at least considering the lack of credible characters and the fixation on some parts of the male body. (oh, even on dogs ...) The story is simply meaningless compared to the more mature Vingar glass that debuted almost at the same time. Obviously the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar av glas had little attention. <br /> <br /> What was really scary for me was the fact that the movie was really bad. This is probably due to the fact that the director Josef Fares, who worked for the first time, used equipment for really cheap cameras and then decided to play with it, for fun, I suppose. The result, however, is a film that can be easily divided into 12 shorts with a new directorial style in each of them. This was very frustrating. Perhaps Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films, since it seems to be the only art form he can master. <br /> <br /> Another disturbing fact is that history does not hold. Several times in the middle of the film, the story must go on very quickly and the characters cross paths with each other in a way that is simply too incredible. <br /> <br /> And then I didn't mention two-dimensional characters, especially those in support roles. <br /> <br /> Although I consider this one of the worst Swedish films of the 90s as well as one of the most overrated, it is understandable that the public enjoyed it. I mean, bad taste has always been the trademark of the masses ... <br /> <br /> I am more surprised that critics enjoyed themselves. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Grade 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
