The redeemable quality of this film (besides Ator's loincloth) is the hilarious acting by the villain, Zor. This wonderfully exaggerated villain has a certain ... oh, Shakespearean presence that made this film bearable (hence 2). I just chuckled every time he twirled, raising an incredulous eyebrow at a henchman or a hero. A true example of someone who is not paid enough. (And the BEARD one!) <br /> <br /> Now, actually, what was with the 12-minute hang-glider scene? Really, really, really bad. I cannot stress this point enough. <br /> <br /> So seriously, if you even like to see this movie, check out the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With those expensive silhouettes, a horrendous film was tolerated.
