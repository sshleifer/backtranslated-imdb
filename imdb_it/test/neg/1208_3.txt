This film is the proverbial 1980s film that shows the viewer that, as long as he or she is looking for something, they can be better than professionals. The main character, Doug, showed his skills in piloting a Cessna aircraft, which somehow amounted to being fully capable of flying a jet and being able to kill people. We all want to have a few million dollars to play with ... maybe make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this film have decided to do Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice ... not even three times; yes, four times. The thing to look forward to is the multitude of "hollywood finals" in this film. Just when you think the film ends after a rough end, there is another approximate ending sequence. Then another Definitely a film to watch for believing ... and maybe just to remember how fantastic the 80s were.
