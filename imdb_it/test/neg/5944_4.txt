Summary: a gang of five young Americans, all that remains of a platoon hit hard during the Ardennes offensive during World War II gets the post of forward outpost and look for enemy activity. They are in very bad condition, both physically and mentally, and think they have reached gold when their outpost is in an abandoned, once luxurious villa full of food. But after a while there is some enemy activity, and it's very strange. Not hostile, but strange. There seems to be a German team out there, in equally bad conditions, who want nothing more than to give up. <br /> <br /> Comments: Based on a novel and I suppose the novel is much better but the story does not seem to translate very well on the big screen. In fact it is a different war movie, much more about mental pressure during the war period than about fighting and battles. But I can almost feel that the scenes that must have been full of suspense, full of uncertainties and unknown elements, have simply fallen into the film. It's not suspenseful, it's just different and in many ways absurd. Many times people simply act crazy, and the reasons are not clear or at best mentioned. <br /> <br /> So when this mental pressure fails to come, the main piece of the whole story, I thought the story would fall through. It wasn't good, it wasn't interesting, it didn't keep me on the edge and it didn't really send a message. In reality he did nothing. <br /> <br /> The cast is interesting, many young actors who then became protagonists at the beginning of their careers. The acting is good, but not stellar, and some characters have fallen into the absurd area. Even in this I feel largely due to this story, these characters need the time, space and rhythm given in a novel, which cannot be given here. And going halfway is not good enough. <br /> <br /> 4/10
