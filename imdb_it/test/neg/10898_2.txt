I've never done one of these before, but this film was literally so bad that I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> They are all for independent cinema as last year saw the worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood screenings, the mainstream seems to have lost contact with what makes movies good. Having said that, films like this really give the independent film a bad reputation. <br /> <br /> The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plot is horrible, the plot itself is horrible, you stay far, far away. Just a brief scene with the bare breasts of a female, and even that was not worth taking a second look. <br /> <br /> The scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ​​having to watch it again. I gave a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it earns a point for each of these traits.
