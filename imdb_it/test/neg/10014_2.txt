At the bottom of the apocalypse's scale is this piece of pisch called "The Final Executioner" .. at least from where I come from. A guy is trained by a former cop to seek revenge on those who killed his woman and friends in cold blood ... and that's it. A lot of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. It has one of the strangest sets of costumes I've seen in a movie for a while, and a massive fortress apparently run by only 7 people. Great job on dubbing guys too (!) Best moment: when our hero loses a sword fight and is going to be skewered through the neck, he takes out the gun and BANG! Why not do it first? It's a mistery. This is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. I'm still baffled about that same time .. 2/10
