I don't care what anyone else says, this film is the worst piece of garbage ever made in the film. What was John Landis thinking? <br /> <br /> I know it's based on a series of children's books, but come on! Even the kids hate this movie. It's useless and boring. Tom Arnold proves once again that his only talent is wasting money on production. <br /> <br /> I think the only reason The Stupids hasn't appeared in the 100 worst movies of all time is that only twenty people will have it admit to watching this junk At least the Hobgoblin have it made on MST3K.
