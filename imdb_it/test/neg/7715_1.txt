I worked in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it home as a free night rental. <br /> <br /> This film was really horrible, there is no quality that redeems it, because in reality it requires a well-respected subgenre of the film and limits itself to destroying it. If the first film was not cheap enough, then this film really takes the biscuit, hosted (mostly) indoors and at night ... thus avoiding the cost setting of the first film In the first 5 minutes of this film a college lecturer comically comes across an attractive student. Rather than being mortified, the teacher apologizes in half and the girl says that, despite having been thrown sideways on the hood of the car (she hastened closer to her) there is nothing to worry about ... attack with a crowbar and kill it! If this isn't strange enough, he wants to experiment with her, taking her away from death ... and so she feels the need to remove her clothes to do it. <br /> <br /> Soft core female nudity (and pubic hair) spread throughout the film and it is, to tell the truth, the only real thing to take into consideration the interest of the male spectator media .. ... like the swimming scene in the first film ... but also having said that this film goes from bad to worse with its bad acting, disgusting dialogue and absurd plot .... why introduce a key character who survived 29 days after the zombie attack just to kill them within 10 minutes ... it's just a very ugly movie
