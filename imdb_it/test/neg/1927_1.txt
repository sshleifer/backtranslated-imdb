I saw this movie to see the direction in which one of the most promising young talents in the movies was going. Unfortunately, with this film, Leelee Sobieski chose a path not only well worn, but completely devoid of any significant destination. This film used every hack in the book to leave the screen, touch you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have the heart strings so that it can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left to feel the love portrayed on the screen. During the emotional climax of this film, I laughed. From the heart. To save you time and money, I would suggest, instead of seeing this film, to have a meal with Karo and Velveeta syrup. It's almost the same thing.
