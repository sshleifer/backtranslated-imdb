Have you ever seen a really bad movie and you get angry? Even a movie for which you didn't have high expectations? Well, I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the video title of the United States for "Interferencia". Now I've seen a lot of bad movies and I've seen a lot of "B" titles, but this is in another league of his own. It was released on the label "The Asylum", and anyone dealing with a large-scale direct horror film knows this label. When you rent one of these, you know what you get. A lot of marginal low-budget acting, but usually still pretty good. Not this one. The acting of the three protagonists was extremely bad. Fast forwarding also could not help. The tag line on the front of the box says "... in the tradition of DePalma's Double Body. The courage to compare it to that classic movie." The only real comment is "The screams you'll hear are real". what you scream if you entrust it.
