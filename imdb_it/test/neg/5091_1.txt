For weeks I couldn't wait to see this movie just to feel enormously disappointed after the wards. In my opinion, the only good thing that River Queen had in mind was the fantastic scenery used as a backdrop. The plot was everywhere, the character of Samantha, Sarah, was very difficult to understand and for what the hell were the close-ups of her face? It brought absolutely nothing to history - if there was one! A better actor for the part of Boy could also have been selected, it seemed to me that he read his lines directly from the script while shooting his scenes. Very pity because it could have been such a beautiful film.
