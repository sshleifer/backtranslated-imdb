As another review, my wife bought this film as part of a package of 20 family films. I imagine we can say that this was a decent movie made for TV for 1980, but it's super-predictable and the acting, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is generally under-par. The football scenes are nothing special and seem primarily to serve as a filler for the film. The film is very dated now, but a decent remake could make it a good movie. However, is it really necessary? I mean, how many "underdog sports teams work together for the big game with unbeaten kids", do we really need movies? This is probably a good movie for your younger children if you find it in the business basket, but a fan of sports movies will find it lacking.
