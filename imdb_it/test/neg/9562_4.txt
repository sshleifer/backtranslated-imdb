The reality of the mafia environment is absolutely a dog-dog-dog in which a gangster is killed to show any sign of weakness because it becomes a responsibility. I have no problem with the human side of gansters' being portrayed, but Bugsy drives too far in the direction of soft and comical men. The film is fun but it's just light entertainment and it's not a biographical film about a man who, while exciting, is extremely dangerous and terrifying. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and the direction is very solid. The places and the era are very well represented and the themes are very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
