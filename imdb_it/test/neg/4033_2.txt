Watching this movie really surprised me. I've never found myself stopping to watch a movie in its entirety because 3 dollars to rent a movie is a good sum of money and a curse, I should at least look at the whole thing and claim my money. I did about 30 minutes of this absolutely lousy movie when I thought to myself, now I'm a little more stupid after seeing this movie. I can't believe that the director and the actors in this film have had such respect for themselves to let this movie be released! <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can say that has not been said by other reviewers, but even in the worst of the films there are usually one or two decent shows ... not in this piece of pathetic garbage . I have seen better acting in school plays. Everyone, and I mean that every "actor" is bad, beyond imagination, and what is really surprising is the uniformity of the wickedness ... oh, it must have been the director. Where did they get these people? <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Although funny in places because of his ridiculous script and even weaker acting, and I use this term very freely, it's a shame that this film wasn't delivered to the hell of movie B for eternity. What could have been a good idea was ruined by a very low budget, poor sounds and effects, and actors who probably gained wings in children's television, and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please, STAY AWAY from this movie. It's not even worth a minute of your time.
