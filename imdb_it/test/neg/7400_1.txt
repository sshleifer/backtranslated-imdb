What a damn bother! You can't go on topics like these with TV budgets and some smart director who can't understand the difference between a Lanc I, II and III. All the silly clich√©s are well positioned; on the character and on the human level the story is so schmaltziana and incredible that it hurts. And all the managers let themselves be carried away by the joy of the brilliant evaluations. Technical details: garbage. Lancs flying so close would kick each other for dozens. Single propulsion night fighters attacking the stern line: ridiculous. As I said: composed by a director I bet he never even heard of the name Lancaster before that project and some 3D kids who turned Lancs into ducks that swayed. But these are minor things compared to the overall mediocrity of this film. Although it may be too harsh, I dare say that this hurts the memory of those who died on both sides. Shit TV, entertaining the stupid masses who don't care anyway. Too bad for those responsible. Use your brain next time. And enjoy the profit you got from it.
