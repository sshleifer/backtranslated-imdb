This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that sucks. The film's low ambitions are clearly exposed when the terrorists hold the vice-president hostage and must call the White House to implore the transfer of some money. In most films of this genre the President is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with his finger on the nuclear button etc. Etc. Would most Americans really be worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is - probably not. Because the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to carry out their operations and because, despite the numerous explosions surrounding them, the public inside the hockey stadium does not realize the situation, they are unanswered questions. Let's just say that this movie is really fake, not hockey. Those who liked the film and found it exciting should have a life.
