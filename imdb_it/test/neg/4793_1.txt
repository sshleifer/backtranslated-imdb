Insignificant for being "brought by the digital effects team behind Independence Day", Coronado is even more a spectacular failure just to be juxtaposed to ID4. This ridiculous mess of a movie starts with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there. A rich, soon married in Beverly Hills are the subjects of this idiotic story. Claire's girlfriend left for a business trip right around Christmas, so she decides to fly to Switzerland to spend her holidays together. I especially like that the initial reason I wanted to go was that he had left some documents at home that he thought he might need. He grabbed them and yelled back as he walked away, concluding that his best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in a villa as cavernous as they were not aware of the existence of mobile phones. <br /> <br /> So, up to this point, the film is incredibly bad, but look at this, THIS is where it starts to get bad! He arrives in Switzerland and when he can't find his husband, he receives a cake and calls his friend to complain about how unjust everything is. This woman is not an action hero, and is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones, for crying out loud. She's a grown-up cheerleader, a spoiled half-sister whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels off the ground when she becomes tall enough to roam the lawn during a wine and cheese party on the cliffs. <br /> <br /> He has a tip that his girlfriend is in South America, so, like her, he flies totally there to get it. Once there, this idiot thinks of going into the jungle alone, sniffing the enemy base and saving his poor helpless boy. He laughs at a comment about the danger of entering, then gets scared later because he discovers that there are battles going on. "You never said anything about the battle!" <br /> <br /> There is a point where Claire and some journalists she met guide this huge truck through a bridge hundreds of meters high and hundreds of meters wide. suspended from two to four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with string, and these idiots decide to pass over it. Not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck, but Claire manages to break away from it, falling hundreds of meters and landing on her back in the lower river below. Later she remembers the event, laughing at him like, oh maybe it was only a hundred. At least he wasn't twirling the tires on his fingers. <br /> <br /> What is really sad about this catastrophically bad film is that they even managed to persuade a terrible performance by the terribly talented John Rhys-Davies, a true Indiana Jones veteran. There is a lot of nonsense about a revolt at the end of the film, where we meet an extremist rebel leader who, when we meet him for the first time, has such a strong accent to roll his as if he thought he was in a Ruffles commercial, then later he talks like a guy who pulled down the streets of Venice Beach. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The special effects are negligible. The team that brought you Independence Day, by the very fact that they were involved with ID4, was simply going through the motions, throwing together some dull and blue screens, I have to believe it because they had nothing better to do. The story is incredibly bad, and Kristin Dattilo, who many other IMDb users mention as the only reason to watch the film, does not put the slightest effort into her performance. Perhaps he thought the digital effects team behind Independence Day could overlap some meaning to this mess. <br /> <br /> And given how much they fell, maybe they thought they could do it too. <br /> <br /> They could at least have tried.
