This mess starts with a real tank running on a car, interconnected with the images of a toy tank. This is followed by a family driving from a birthday party without saying anything. The unexplained tank and the untreated family take, I swear, over 10 minutes of film. In the end, the family sees a car after being in a wreck and decides to report it to the competent authorities, only to find that the citizens of the city are hiding in their homes and the cops are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Almost. When the people of the city come out because of the presence of the family, we learn that both the writer and the publisher are conspiring to replace the suspense with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hope that the inability of the public to say what will happen in some way brings discomfort to the public. and it works! ... but not in the way they thought it would happen. I was very uneasy about how bad this movie was, but not at all scared. Dialogue is composed of things that make little sense. Not in a way, David Lynch, but some kind of boring conversation in the middle of a boring conversation. Over the next hour, we learn that filmmakers try to bore us by showing us fearful showing boringly mundane scenes combined with the aforementioned "what's up?" type scenes. <br /> <br /> The plot involves something along the lines of kind-looking old men who put children into a trance through the power of Satan and then take them to a party to play with toys, and even more sinister intentions , and it is up to a group of white men (all white in the film) to grab their weapons and save the situation, and a woman cutting a knife who dreams of a drop of her hat. They look for kidnapped children by looking at random places and shouting children's names. <br /> <br /> This is a great horror film for anyone who has never seen a horror movie because that person is frightened by the simple thought of Satanism, paganism, Wicca, or even Catholicism due to a lifetime brainwashing diet by the Trinity Broadcast Network. This represents Satanism as old people in Halloween costumes with candles mixing at a party, in front of an Ankh. Replace it with a priest who makes absurdities completely invented about Satanists, while he calls them "witches". The message that all that is not Protestantism can be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. <br /> <br /> About 30 minutes of footage is wasted on showing mediocre actors and old people who are shaking awkwardly to make a Goth teenager blush, almost always in Old English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be invented. <br /> <br /> The highlights include a guy who laughs at the idea of ​​little green men for a solid 3 minutes, a family looking out the windows of their car without speaking for 10 minutes while listening to the muzak elevator . A priest who studies Satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-scary drawings of demons to scare the crowd of the Church. Random shots of dolls. Random shots of children. Paint instead of blood anyway. Sequences of dreams at the film school level. Presents unimportant characters who do nothing before they leave. Sometimes, they act as if the Nothing they are doing is a big problem. <br /> <br /> The direction is rather sloppy. An example of direction includes a scene at the beginning where a man and a woman are kissing and the man walks away to look at her lovingly in the eyes and a dark red paint falls on his cheek. Looking up, they see that it is not blood, but droplets from a snowcone of a girl. Snowcones are ice and colored / flavored water, and would not have produced droplets of the same consistency as paint, not to mention the fact that his snowcone was a bright orange-red. The writing of Hackney, certainly, but made even worse by the bad direction. Then he cuts an alternative shot of the man, the woman and the girl and shows that he is standing about a meter away from them, so the snowcone would not have dripped on the woman even if he had kept his snowcone on the woman face. Way to go, publisher! Of course, acting is blah. The acting of the whole cast could be put on a scale and perfectly balanced between the excessive and the undertone. <br /> <br /> The director's most offensive technique is not to give the actors any motivation and then go out for lunch like the impassive eye of leer cameras while the actors make fun of themselves. <br /> <br /> And finally, we come to a final that would have been great if it had been run by competent people and not by Jerry Falwell.
