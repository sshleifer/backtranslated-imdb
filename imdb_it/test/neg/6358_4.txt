* Spoiler - sorry! * The first word that came to my mind while watching the film is "Gremlins". It's the only critters movie I've seen in the four films, but I liked it. It wasn't too complicated because I hadn't seen the past two, but I thought it was still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Critters start with a man, his son and daughter stop on the road for a vacation (even if it turns out they end up in their house - that I have no idea what the hell went on) The girl he meets with a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they go around in a nearby forest. They meet this strange guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the creatures. He looks a little psychotic and if I were in that situation, I wouldn't talk to him. The animals steal a ride from the girl and the boy's car and end up in their flat thing. They hide in the basement and end up killing this lazy idiot. So they almost kill this fat woman and the girl's dad. They are pursued higher and higher until they hide in the attic. The creatures eat stuff in the kitchen (a parody of the gremlins kitchen scene ???!) And I can't remember (it's not a good thing) but I'm sure they have to come back for something / someone. However they end up going out and saving. The psychotic boy returns and before he kills the last two idiots he is told that he cannot because they are in danger and therefore sends them home. <br /> <br /> The ending was disappointing and it bothered me that only the lazy guy died because there were some annoying characters that I would personally kill. It is an exciting and exciting film that is worth watching. But, if you're looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend the gremlins movies. Sorry!
