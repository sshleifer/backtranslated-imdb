End of Days, start well enough, Arnie plays an unscrupulous cop (a character very similar to Riggs in the lethal weapon) and the story seems like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment. <br /> <Br /> Unfortunately he can't deliver, Arnie is as good as we expected, but as for Gabriel Byrne I expect him to choose his roles more carefully than that. cast like the devil; this is probably the weakest portrait of the lord of darkness. <br /> <br /> This film becomes a bit too silly for me, and the final sequence, besides being very weak, is visually one of the worst. In recent years, CGI has been better than this since the early 1990s . <br /> <br /> Simply not good enough. 4/10 (Look at it if you have it too, but don't expect too much, because it won't deliver it)
