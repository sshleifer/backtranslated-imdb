I thought that I could make some laughs from this long film, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This film is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a positive vote without even trying to open a book or do something. The film also starred masters and the principal, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs Stark), "Labor Pains", 2000 as complete idiots. I know this was supposed to be a comedy, but it never made me laugh and I thought the whole movie was a LOW TIME COMPLETE! However, all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this movie a fun and entertaining movie! Simply studying and getting good grades for college is the only way to GO!
