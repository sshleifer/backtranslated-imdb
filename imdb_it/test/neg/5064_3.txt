I have to admit that I chose this film only for the cast, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers, the rest of the film was disappointing. It seems to have been created by a group of teenagers with low-level scripts, namely scripts without depth, horrible photography and editing, and a hilarious score! I can't believe I was able to see this seemingly long film to the end ... the sad thing is that this may have been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a success; that is, there are two main ingredients: a great story of national conspiracies and a great main cast (although many other actors are practically soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it was not worth more than a 3 in my opinion.
