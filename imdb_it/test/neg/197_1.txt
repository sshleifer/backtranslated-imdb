I was a 22-year-old hippie in 1965, I saw the game 5 times, I have 2 versions of the music and I read the script many times. Perhaps taken as a separate thing, the film is OK, but as an adoption of the comedy, it is terrible. <br /> <br /> The beauty first. The songs are sung well and the production values ​​are pretty good. The homosexual implications in Black Boys, White Boys are cute. The Claude / Berger switch was interesting. Hair is a fluid production, and constant changes are intrinsic as long as the basic spirit is maintained. <br /> <br /> But the basic spirit was very distorted. It seemed that the whole producer wanted to sing certain songs and adapt the plot regardless of what he did to the original intent of the play. <br /> <br /> Claude, Sheila and Hud were presented as selfish brats who could care less than anyone else outside their tribe. Claude destroyed Sheila's parents' party (it's hard to believe he smiled while his parents were injured), and he repeatedly stole cars. Sheila stole the soldier's clothes and the car. Then he left him in the middle of the desert, where he would surely burn his burns, probably would be arrested in rank, and he would probably die on that lonely Nevada road. Have fun. And Hud found it okay to break his son's heart as he screamed at his ex. It is not what the hippies were, not what the game described, and it is directly opposed to a generation of love. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a hippie ask for money. The point was to be self-sufficient outside the capitalist system, not begging. <br /> <br /> After Berger was thrown into prison for ruining Sheila's party and Claude offers to save someone, Berger insists on being saved. , without a better plan to release the rest than to hit Sheila's parents, and then hit her mom. <br /> <br /> "Be In" has always been a very spiritual point, but wives floating around are wasted here. Although this is part of his journey, it ruins a beautiful song. I know they are fighting "Floating In Space" with the army. But again, it totally ruins a beautiful song. <br /> <br /> While Sheila and Claude are thin, Berger steals their clothes, laughing "he was a funny man" even after seeing both were very annoyed. Then a little later, Berger does something that no hippie ever does. It affects Claude. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Then they have the perfect opportunity to sing "Starshine" at night in a nice place in SF with shining stars, perhaps working on an inventive duet. Instead, the entire tribe sings it in the scorching sun that hurtles along the road in a convertible (obviously stolen). I was deeply disappointed in the film in 1979, and I like it even less now. I think it would have been possible to make a reasonably close adoption of the show, but this is not it.
