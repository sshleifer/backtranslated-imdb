I bought this movie from a market stall three years ago .. I have to deliver it to you when I sat down to watch it .. I thought 'OK! This will be another great action movie on B .. 'Obviously I was wrong ... While watching this movie ... I started to understand that this movie was taking me to another planet .. full of cr * p! <br /> <br /> I started to get bored and bored with this movie .. Although I wanted to see what would happen in the end .. I really felt like I was really getting nervous .. <br /> <br /> The people behind the film may have brought some well-known actors named in this project .. But what were they thinking ..? Even these actors failed to save this film .. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film .. It seemed to me that this was a waste of money .. simply by buying this sucker of low-life films for a small amount of money. A few months later, I sent the tape to charity. I didn't want to see it again .. <br /> <br /> Sorry! But if you're thinking about watching a movie and then falling asleep sleeping ... I can highly recommend it to you .. Me? I prefer to go to Pro-Plus and watch something decent ..! <br /> <br /> Disappointing 1 in 10!
