As someone has already said that the Living Dead Dolls were nice and if they came out as a new series of little bad things, I would buy one or two. Well, basically this film was obscure, not in the scary sense, but in the sense that I don't see a way. And it was boring Three females in one house, the youngest said she didn't enter the woods under any circumstances (although she didn't sink) and it would have been better if that council had implicated their death. And nobody does cleaning or whitewashing or anything like that, you would think a lot of coughing would result. A sexy young mom where to waste your time trying to calculate her age (with my calculations 34 or 36.) And it seemed like it had been more than 20 years since someone lived there, so what was with photos of young adults of the father on much older album? I'm so tired of clichés that it's just lazy writing, and here they come so dense and fast. You guys get drunk and drunk in the car and you know where it leads ... death and apparent deafness also because Tim seems oblivious to his screaming friends. I mean, I pushed a lot of cars where the driver didn't shout and I heard them. Cliché strange man in the woods that nobody believes. Plumber who has lived in their parts for years and this is his first experience with the aforementioned children, so that driving pigeons avoids handling young in the middle of the night ... invest it on you idiot! Cliché ... wandering in the woods without the slightest idea of ​​where you are going, armed with the knowledge that the handlers who hold children (yes, they again) are around. Senseless scene, the brutalization of the pig ... why don't so many directors see any problem with mutilation and animal slaughter? I would have preferred to see children running and biting people on their thighs. Zombies don't seem to have that much energy in other movies. Is the villain very well how ineffective it was? His important part was in the shop ... trampling and asking to be served first. What an eventful man he was. Why not kill him first, before the family arrived there and avoided the film being made, or redid it differently. I give my votes to the house, to the woods and to the small sweets Goth I want one!
