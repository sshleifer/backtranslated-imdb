This was the worst movie I've ever seen. I have to admit that I didn't watch it from beginning to end, since cleaning the bathroom was more fun. <br /> <br /> The "star" was the most unpleasant character I've ever seen, neither funny nor attractive, in fact, gruesome and hateful are too free. <br /> <br /> It is painful to watch, there is no acting, especially not from the star who acts like a mentally deficient moron take off on one of those noisy black-mouthed actors. <br /> <br /> As horrible as looking at one of those who can't silence black actors, watching one of the Puerto Ricans is even worse. <br /> <br /> The name of the film is descriptive, he is the parasite. This film is not to be missed.
