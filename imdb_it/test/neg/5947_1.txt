Tom Selleck plays an absent son in the senile "pop" Don Ameche and the tired mother Anne Jackson, making up for his indiscretions (presumably) and taking them after Ameche burned his mobile home; meanwhile, Selleck's work is defeated by F.B.I., his possessions are frozen, his wife and children abandon him and his hateful sister and brats have come to stay. The comedy of the sick, painted in bright colors, is out of touch with reality like the old coot of Am√®che. Perhaps a first serious draft (with scenes like Ameche moving into traffic with two young children) was incorporated into a second or third more silent version (with Selleck having been hit, bumped, struck and eventually lost a finger and a testicle!). In any case, it is a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense; he limps and howls of pain, but keeps his heart of mush. This movie is crazy. * from ****
