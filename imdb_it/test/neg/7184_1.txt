I'm still not sure what the hell this movie is. I imagine the boy was afraid of going blind and he began to imagine all sorts of strange things. that doesn't explain why he wanted to kill his new little brother, however, or the inexorable boredom found in this movie. As you watch this movie, you wish you were blind, so you didn't have to see this experiment unnecessarily. skip this steaming pile and opt for anything else at the video store ..... anything else.
