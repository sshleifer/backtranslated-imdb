I was watching this movie and I was getting more and more bored with the silly story that was not going anywhere, when suddenly the story takes a surreal turn for the worse and has an actor playing herself. Oh, how sneering. Because it's so funny, isn't it? We know that Julia Roberts plays the character of Tess, and here they are, in the film, making a joke about the fact that Tess's character is a bit like Julia Roberts. So Julia plays someone who plays Julia. How well he does it, we'll never know, because 99.999% of the public actually doesn't know Julia Roberts personally (and her reading in the Hello magazine doesn't count). <br /> <br /> And then Bruce Willis arrives! Apparently, he is Julia Roberts' best friend. Well, he's in the movie ... how do I know if Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts know each other or not? I'm not remotely interested in the personal lives of the actors: I only pay my money and expect them to do the work they were paid to do. In any case, they start joking about the twist in the film where Willis (rather unconvincing) plays a psychiatrist ... the one with the little baby inside ... you know that? Not me, I forgot what it's called. Willis even leaves a comment on how well that movie was made at the box office - how modest Mr. Willis is! <br /> <br /> The problem is that, not only are these scenes useless and horribly self-indulgent, it also reminds us, the spectators, that we are simply observing a group of actors who wander around and are paid huge sums of money with very little effort. See, when I see a movie, I want to suspend disbelief and forget I'm watching the actors - I want to believe the story I'm watching. When you start pulling the scenery down, in the middle of the movie, you simply have to ruin the illusion for me. <br /> <br /> You know that a TV series blew up the shark when it starts introducing celebrities, playing alone (stand up and be counted The Simpsons, Friends, etc.), but this is the first time that I see a movie skip the shark. I usually keep away from movies like that (eg Scary Movie, The Naked Gun, etc.). The problem is that, honestly, I never thought that the 11 ocean films would go in this direction. What a shame. <br /> <br /> So, with the suspension of disbelief thrown out the window, and the plot that now languishes in the film then cracks the most wicked joke of everyone on the audience - the blow actually happened in the distant past history, and the last 90 minutes of the film were useless attitudes. Yes, it's true: Steven Soderwhatsit and all his fellow actors stand up, point us to the audience and say, "Ha ha ha ... you all had ... thanks for your money!" Then they greet us with single fingers. <br /> <br /> Well, right to you. Actually I didn't pay to watch this movie ... I downloaded the DVD for nothing. How do you like apples? Now it's a twist.
