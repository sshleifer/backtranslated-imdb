The Mad Monster begins in the laboratory of Dr. Lorenzo Cameron (George Zucco) while perfecting his discovery of how to transform a human being into a vicious wolf monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject that appears to be his dull servant Petro (Glenn Strange ), apparently intends to put the serum at the disposal of the war department that will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the supreme soldier! However, first things first, as dr. Cameron aims to take revenge on the people who rejected his experiments, forced him to resign and subjected him to a public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creation to kill Professor Blaine (Robert Strange), in an unfortunate series of events that Dr. Cameron is unable to control the beast and is spotted by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spreads the news as a fire, in another unfortunate coincidence a journalist named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) takes the breath of history and begins to investigate, he begins to suspect Dr. Cameron and since Gregory goes out with his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) has many opportunities to smell ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Sam Newfield, this is a really low budget of the 40s, even worse is unoriginal and unoriginal stuff . Fred Myton's script draws the extremely thin premise up to almost 77 minutes, which is too long, there is no variety in the story and it is basically the same thing over and over again. The characters are boring clichés, the mad scientist who conducts useless experiments that create a monster, the fragile, pretty daughter, the journalist who plays the hero and by pure coincidence it happens to both of them to investigate the mysterious deaths that the mad scientist is responsible for & romantically involved with his daughter, the stupid servant, stupid idiotic cop and stereotypical rifle wielding peasants who are always accused of drunkenness. It was probably a cliché as early as 1942! The film trudges at a fairly slow pace and director Newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in terms of excitement or atmosphere which is a bad thing. Technically the film is not great, obviously the budget was tiny and the crazy monster itself seems lame, like an old homeless wino who hasn't shaved for a few weeks and has had a pair of plastic jokes from jokes put in his mouth. Black and white cinematography is fundamental and static like most films of this period, while the good laboratory of dr. Cameron consists of a sofa and a table with some scant pieces of scientific material on top. The acting is stiff and made of wood with Petro who seems to be drugged throughout the film, Zucco like the mad scientist is unconvincing and forgettable. The Mad Monster is a rather disgusting horror film, here there is very little to entertain even if at least I did it until the end in a single session which, if I think about it, is a goal in itself!
