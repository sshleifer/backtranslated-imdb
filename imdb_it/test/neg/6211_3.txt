First of all let's talk about the story. It is a copy of the film "Hitch" with the addition of Indian Flavor. A boy, who is a guru of Love, and another man who is apparently a sucker when it comes to women, and like this apparently sucked he becomes a charmer with the help of the love guru who forms history. Salman Khan is the guru of love, and Govinda is the lame. <br /> <br /> Now, coming to the artists' performance, Salman Khan manages to make a mistake throughout the film, trying to be funny, but fails a lot of time. You can see Salman screaming throughout the film, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda couples in front of Katrina Kaif (Oh, my god, she is a girl of real beauty) is a 50-year-old boy in real life, and Katrina is a girl in her early twenties. In the film, Govinda seems to be Katrina Kaif's grandfather. What a pity! Coming to the execution of the film. This movie looks like a B-Movie and a poor imitation of the Hitch movie. Where Hitch looks like a film with a purpose and depth, this film is superficial and aimless, nowhere is there justification or clarity. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie, because it is nothing but a boring, typical Bollywood cuisine. Actually I give 3/10 because this is the lowest I go.
