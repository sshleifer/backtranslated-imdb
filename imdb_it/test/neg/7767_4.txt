I didn't expect much from the movie, so I'm not entirely disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big had eyebrows colored with crayons and Samantha hadn't said f ***. <br /> <br /> Charlotte's child was annoying to watch while he was in too many scenes: the title could easily have been "SATC: Parents' Night Out". The camera angles were not so good, especially with regards to Carrie's face. <br /> <br /> There was a woman of discarded color in whose character there was not an adequate exit and too few appearances by homosexuals who still seemed to be thrown aimlessly. Samantha is going back and forth to LA choked the flow of history, especially when she arrives for fashion week and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have been made in a hurry because it could have gone well, but the scenes have just been launched to show different outfits or to offer viewers the chance to return to the show without adding much to the story .
