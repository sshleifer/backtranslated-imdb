Every so often I come across a film so terribly embarrassing that I wonder why movies exist. This is one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody the Godfather with annoying sounds of cartoons and ugly dialogues. Eddie Deezen is just as annoying as Tony, an annoying twit who, at his father's request, Don (William Hickey), takes over the management of the family business. Tony, like I said, is an annoying little idiot. This makes the whole movie a complete disaster. The film is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish. The main point I'm trying to make is that you can't make a parody of an acclaimed drama like The Godfather with so much sympathy. It doesn't work that way. Believe it or not, you have to take the drama parody seriously. If you don't take it seriously, it will seem too much like a parody. The fact of making a parody is that you can't look too much like a parody. You have to make it look like you're taking the movie at least a little bit seriously. He also seems to be mocking Woody Allen, and this is what makes this movie absolutely terrible.
