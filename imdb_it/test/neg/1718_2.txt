Tycus is one of the worst movies on video that I always see. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this product does not appear in the cinema. Visual effects (The beginning is terrible) Bad actors (I don't understand why the great Dennis Hopper appears in this film) and nonsense Bad screen. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. SENTENCE FOR TYCUS: Don't watch this movie.
