Unbelievable. I've never seen anything like this. Everything is bad; really bad. From photography (many scenes without focus!) To acting (the young female is terrible). And what can we say about those helicopter made of Paint Brush ...? Really incredible B, I mean, Z film. <br /> <br /> The plot is bad, clich√© and badly written. The basic concepts of the script seem to work. I can't even think of a young film student making this film. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I advise you not to even think about seeing this movie. Sleeping or playing alone are the best choices. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
