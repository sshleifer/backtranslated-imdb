Writer-director Emilio Estevez shows a certain lack of talent here with this non-redeemable comedy. The script is completely hopeless, not to mention the fact that it is unoriginal and malfunctioning. Comedy doesn't work. When Estevez does not use tacky jokes, he borrows the used gags and does them a lot. You'd think Estevez's group and brother Charlie Sheen would be fantastic ... but ... it's not. <br /> <br /> The entire cast is uninspired and not funny, it has never managed to make people laugh, and barely a smile from the public. Do yourself a favor and leave this on the video shelf. <br /> <br /> Thursday 25 June 1992 - Video
