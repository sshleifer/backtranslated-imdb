The good things first: I agree with another viewer who said that Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunken scene. He does - I was tickled to finally have a chance to laugh. And there were other moments that I found amusing: Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the faulty plumbing, and the scene in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by putting sweet nothingness in his mouth. <br /> <br /> But overall, I was dismayed. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the restrictions imposed on productions by the Hays code. But this was embarrassing and terrible to watch. Of course I knew they would end up together, this is a romantic comedy, after all. But it didn't make sense, it happened too fast. Furthermore, I cannot believe in the professions of love in the face of such painful behavior, both physical and conflicting.
