Although I tried to avoid German films recently, the positive reviews led me to rent this movie. There I am screwed again by the German media that have repeatedly agitated domestic gestures repeatedly. For me, it's no wonder that nobody abroad wants to see this shit. The idea of ​​making this film is not an idea at all (I imagine a madman would read an article in a women's magazine about speed dating). In short: the characters (who are nobody), the dialogue and the content are so incredibly banal, banal and banal, I kept watching because I couldn't believe what I saw. BTW to call the flat theses provided mechanically from the dialogues of the figures (certainly from the magazines mentioned above), it would simply be incorrect. Acting is so exaggerated, I can't remember worse than the one on the screen for a long time. You have to guess that the director has / has no idea at all. Incredibly distributors and producers from all over the country are still wondering why German films (with rare exceptions) do not generate any interest all over the world. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
