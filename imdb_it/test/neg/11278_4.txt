For this film, based on a TV show and a serious ending. I thought it was a bad way to end a serious one. 'M * A * S * H ​​Goodbye, goodbye and Amen' was pretty good, but not this one. Unless you really love the series (Like myself) skip this movie. <br /> <br /> I was a faithful fan of the Even Stevens show, but the plot was too tricky, and Dave Coulier, friend, that guy didn't do something good ... well, never. They shouldn't have used Tim Meadows, he's a great actor, but he was too good for the script. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was pure cheese. I would give a 4.5 / 10
