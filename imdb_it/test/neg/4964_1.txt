Looking at these reviews and seeing all these high ratings, I can make you believe that a large amount of red corn syrup will satisfy almost all idiotic idiots. This film is beyond useless. All the clich√©s of a slasher film without any substance. I'm sure I can get into the details of the movie, but why worry when you can summarize? Obviously everyone wants Mandy Lane and she obviously doesn't want any of the boys. You'll see it throughout the film. <br /> <br /> When he stops being a friend of the typical boy trapped in a friend-friend loser, he becomes ballistic and when he travels to the middle of nowhere where (sure) he starts hunting them one by one. Sounds pretty decent, doesn't it? But what made the film suck beyond imagination is when you find out that it's not just his loser, the murderer, but it's her too. The plan was beyond all limits. We leave all our friends together and then we kill each other. They do not give any reason why they wanted to do this and given the "Goody Too Shoes" behavior of Mandy Lane it makes you scratch your head even more about what is actually motivating these characters to do whatever they are doing. It is sad .. this film has a lot of potential, but the director or writer cannot in any way relate to the public.
