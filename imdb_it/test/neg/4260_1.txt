this is by far the most pathetic film that Indian cinema or any cinema has come up with. It's totally a piece of shit. The factions of the plot do not hold water. it is shameful that such a respectful actor has lowered himself to the point of making a film so shameful. the little respect he has is lost forever. he should have retired long ago instead of teasing himself and losing all self-respect. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would also suggest that Amitabh should retire already. I wonder how IMDb gave some recommendations to this film. there are no films so horrible that recommendations can be made. watching movies like Devdas on the same line as this film is a grave injustice to a decent movie. overall I could say shameless.
