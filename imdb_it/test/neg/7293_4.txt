Because Disney often does, ignoring the quality of the animation and the need for a good storyline in their sequels, this was actually a nice surprise. I don't know why Disney no longer pays attention to their sequels. The graphic quality is always lower; no wallpapers worthy of the name Disney, inane textures and worse dialogues, with little or no attention given to the true story, and caricature drawings are almost always worse than Saturday morning cartoons in detail and quality. <br /> <br /> The quality of the animation is still scarce compared to the Disney originals and the dialogue is rather banal, the plot and the overall performance were really pleasant. <br /> <br /> Even if it is not so captivating, it cannot completely capture the charm and / or mystery of the first. There is some clue, hidden here and there. <br /> <br /> Children will appreciate it anyway. <br /> <br /> The score is 4.5 / 10 from ... <br /> the Demon :.
