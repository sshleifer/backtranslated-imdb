This film was horrendous ... It had absolutely nothing to do with Dark Harvest. And the DVD was very misleading because it showed a scarecrow and a scythe, none of which appeared in this movie. <br /> <br /> The beginning was a mixture of random scenes that, for the most part, had nothing to do with the film, apart from the fact that they show that man is a psychic ... but not too good ... <br /> <br /> After the first 10 minutes of the film there is an hour of the character who looks at the man for his daughters. It becomes vaguely interesting when daughters meet two girls who died the year before. But this is its scope. <br /> <br /> And why, I might ask, was this film classified as R? There were two drops of blood and 4 swear words. And how the hell did you get into a video store ?? This film was badly performed, badly shot, badly written and overall performed horribly.
