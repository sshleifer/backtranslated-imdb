Some might go for a movie like this, but I certainly didn't. A university professor, David Norwell, suddenly gets a yen for adoption. He basically takes the first child offered, a bad choice named Adam. Apparently Adam doesn't have both oars in the water that almost immediately cause stress and untold disorder for Dr. Norwell. This hiccup took place with one problem after another, all centered around Adam's incapacities and seizures. Why Norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like a foster child was never explained. Along the way the good doctor managed to attract a little wife to share all the hell that the little boy was doing. Personally, I think both were a beer short of a sixpack. Bypass this yawn.
