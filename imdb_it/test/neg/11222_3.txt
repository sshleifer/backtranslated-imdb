This film is an obvious Underworld USA scam with Cliff Robertson. You owe it to yourself to invest a couple of hours and look at the original. I found this in disagreement and difficult to follow, with many scenes that didn't make much sense. I'm not against violence in movies, but this whole thing seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to blow one person after another, many of whom were only marginally connected to the plot. With all the others being killed, I wondered all through the film why Frank hadn't just blown Johnny's brain. Certainly he could have and Johnny certainly didn't behave like someone he could trust. Another thing that bothers me is the sex scenes; why do these people have sex with their clothes? Should it turn on? Surely they didn't think they had a shot at a PG appraisal. Nothing in this film seemed to play naturally. as if looking at people in real life, instead it was done in a heavy and superficial way.
