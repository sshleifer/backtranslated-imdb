Harmony Korrine: do you hate it or hate it? On this evidence, to hate could be a better word. Not him obviously, just everything he does. But it may have been so different because the first ten minutes of this film promise so much including a fantastic idea of ​​a Michael Jackson impersonator who falls in love with a Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Fantastic. And set in Paris! This could be fantastic. But unfortunately, Korrine can arouse the strange decent idea, but since he is a horrible writer, the story fails at all levels and the audience that witnessed about an hour is the proof that it's the most boring and pretentious film out there. Apparently the dropout rate at his premiere in recent years at the Cannes festival was quite shocking. Instead of focusing on the two protagonists, he foolishly passes the story to the confines of a castle to present a group of other imitators who make the whole experience tedious and sterile narrative. When will independent cinema end up financing this newcomer?
