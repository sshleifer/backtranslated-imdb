I guess the people who talk about this turntable are the director's companion or something. This is bad, and not in the way of Michael Jackson's song. Comparing the pace of this film with the progress of a snail would insult the snail. This film trudges for what seems like an eternity, all to introduce us to some unsuspecting zombies with a stupid trick and some sort of revenge, or bloodlust, or whatever. Believe me, you won't be interested. The mere thought that her mother would have moved her two daughters into this dilapidated and FILTERED house is absurd. And worse, I simply found myself not paying attention. Backstory on zombie children? Snoring. Endangerment of mother and / or daughters? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> In short, WOW was so boring. Do not worry
