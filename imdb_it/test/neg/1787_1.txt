This film is so hopelessly bad, NOTHING about it is worth seeing. NO effect, no suspense and poor dialogue delivered badly. Oh, and neither a CAMP nor any FEAR contains it. Do yourself a favor and go see the original Friday 13th or (preferably) Sleepaway Camp, but what ever you do, DO NOT watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Even the appearance of Michele Bauer at the beginning cannot save him. Usually, in this type of film you expect violence, suspense and a bit of cold blood and a little bit of T & A. the T & A is abundant in the first 5 minutes, then nothing. At least one of these things, done correctly, would have at least made it visible. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing, Buck Flower is great, seems to be the only one to understand that they are doing schlock and rightly sums it up. If everyone else had adapted that tone it would have been fun to camp, no pun intended.
