This film is simply awful, the film only lasted an hour and for about 25 minutes of the film there were only useless clips of casual snowboards that didn't even connect to the film. The plot is completely "retarted", my 5-year-old cousin could probably write a better script. I don't understand how anyone can finance the production of a movie like this ... horrible. This is definitely the most horrible film I've ever seen in my whole existence. I think the casting director just took some random guys from the street to play in this movie. The direction, the acting, the production and the writing of this film are really bad. I feel bad for people who have wasted money to fund this garbage. U couldn't pay me to look at this shit again.
