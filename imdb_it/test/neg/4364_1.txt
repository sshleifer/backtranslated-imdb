I'm sorry but this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that after making the first of the series they managed to get a budget to make another one. Not that the budget could have been much - this is the least scary movie I've ever seen and laughed to the end (actually I can't believe I saw it until the end), but I think it's because we couldn't believe it enough
