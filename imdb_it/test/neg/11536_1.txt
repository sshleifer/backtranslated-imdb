I know that when you buy a used DVD (oops, excuse me, seen above) for $ 5.99 you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this poor boxed record. <br /> <br /> I will credit the producers to provide a complex challenge for the viewer. . . to determine which is the worst, acting, screenplay, camera work, special effects. . . they are all rather tied up for the simple terrible. Oh, he has the worst FALSE car accident ever used in a movie anywhere. <br /> <br /> Now all this is a serious ridicule for a movie fan who proudly boasts "Police Academy", "Pistol naked", 'Weapon Lamped for National Lampoon' and a host of other campy records in his collection. But, at least those know that that language should be firmly planted in a cheek, the cast of PW, unfortunately they use their languages ​​in an attempt to deliver inane dialogue and, although it is almost beyond my belief, the Movie characters seem to think they could actually do something of value: a pornographer at the back of the room would be ashamed to release this mess. <br /> <br /> Oh. ... lucky, I bought the worst video ever made at the same time ... "Demonio della Fraternità" ... maybe the name should have given me a hint.
