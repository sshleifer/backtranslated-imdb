I don't normally worry about wasting my time writing junk comments like this one that I almost forget when I see it, but since I saw this movie yesterday on one of Comcast's Showtime channels (346, I think) I decided to make a exception. <br /> <br /> Besides the fact that I enjoyed watching Carol Alt, I can't give any rational reason why I saw this movie until the end. I am always amazed that good-looking women are willing to appear in terrible films like this, but I suppose they thought this film would lead to something better. I hope he's right, for his sake. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it is a typically straight-to-video riot laugh, or just a piece of junk, depending on your point of view. While there are some decent moments of action in this film, they don't connect well with the story, for example. <br /> <br /> The installation, as I recall, involved Carol Alt as a depressed housewife who believes her husband, a policeman, betrays her. There was also something in which their child was dying in an accident, and she blamed him for it, but before that plot went somewhere she would shoot and kill him. <br /> <br /> On the same fateful night, a wounded stranger comes to his door and she tends to him, and almost immediately his house is under siege by government minions and mercenaries intent on capturing the stranger, who seems to have almost superhuman fighting skills. <br /> <br /> This same type of material has produced a fair amount of entertainment many other times, particularly in Matt Damon's The Bourne Identity, and it may have done so again this time, but this particular film was disappointed by the poor production values ​​and a bad script. <br /> <br /> Eventually the film falls apart, when the mysterious stranger turns out to be a cyborg (!) Planned to be a policeman, and after discovering that Carol Alt killed her husband, try to kill her! The film has not been particularly beautiful up to this point, but the ending really ruins it, trying to turn a modest action thriller into a lumpy would-be Terminator / Robocop. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the violence in the film was a bit excessive at the end, with the demented cyborg digging the poor eye of Carol Alt before finally biting the dust. What was the point of this? Besides, what was the point of everything in this film? It caught my attention and entertained me for about an hour, until the end, when it reminded me that I wasn't watching a top quality movie. It wasn't even a second-rate film for that. <br /> <br /> The final scenes seem to suggest a sequel, which I don't think ever happened, even though I didn't check the web carefully for it. Needless to say, I am in no hurry to see the sequel to this film.
