A terminally boring thriller, which can sound quite theoretical but which works very badly. The ridiculous script is full of (MINOR SPOILER) people who die and then come back to life when the plot requires them, and the director doesn't seem able to produce energy and suspense. The sticky sequence that "explains" the title of the film is the only one memorable in the middle in this boring film. (* 1/2)
