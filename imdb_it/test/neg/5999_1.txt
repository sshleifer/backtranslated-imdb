I can't see what everyone is seeing in this movie. The acting is simply horrible, the choice of music is, to say the least, strange, there are not enough fighting scenes, the plot is non-existent and any little entertainment you can get from this film is ruined by the annoying way of some of the movies is filmed and gives you decisive power.
