"My Blue Heaven" is boring. The plot is insipid; characterizations and dialogue stink; the musical numbers, even if occasionally staged in interesting ways, are not only too often absurd, but also lyrically banal, painfully bright and emotionally empty to the core. The protagonists, Betty Grable and Dan Dailey, are attractive professionals; however, despite all their talented efforts to raise the rough and uncompetitive material, they fail. David Wayne and Jane Wyatt, for all their talent shown in other projects, are more or less cyphers here. <br /> <br /> There is really only one reason to look at "My Blue Heaven". One reason ... a star: Mitzi Gaynor, in his debut film. His total screen time is probably less than ten minutes, but then? His brilliant and promising personality, his feline beauty and his exceptional charisma shine through gloriously and make these minutes the most watchable, memorable and exciting moments of the whole film. If you appreciate the opportunity to see a young talent on the rise, then take a look at Miss Mitzi Gaynor in "My Blue Heaven". <br /> <br /> Incidentally, I despise (and urge you to avoid) Drew Casper's obsessive-compulsive DVD commentary for this film. Wordy, digested, excessively meticulous, often inappropriate of what is playing on the screen, and galloping with an excess of nervous energy, his comments are absolutely indigestible.
