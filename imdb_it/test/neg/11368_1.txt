This was the worst TV movie I've ever seen. The images were so loud that they made my head spin. I hated zoom and constant zoom, and the frequent transition from white to black to color. I also thought the story made no sense, and that it was another clich√© action movie, with a bad hero and some hostages. I could make a better film than the one with my camera, why? I can keep it still, something the director couldn't do. Overall, the worst I've ever seen, did you think Disney was bad? I didn't even bother looking at it because I'm sure I can guess the result, and the visual was the worst I've ever seen.
