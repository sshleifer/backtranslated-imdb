If the following seem tempting, then rush to your local Blockbuster and rent this post-spite movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Awful 60's hairstyles, from pathetic perms to damaging ducks. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world of all time, who does nothing but cry and say Dad in the most annoying voice imaginable. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that don't fit the movie. To all. <br /> <br /> 4. The stereotypical Indians who use the blowguns and speak gobbledegook. Oh, and it's obvious that they are hanging around a bonfire. <br /> <br /> 5. False and false aircraft crash mechanisms in which the cast actually throws itself into the corners of the cardboard set. <br /> <br /> 6. The external shots of 5, which look as suspicious as a toy jet on a rope that is carried into a studio lit with blue light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that make those used in the first Star Trek series a cutting edge compared to the comparison. (Special mention: the boy's blond hair shines, oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Redundant modification and continuity, in which the background elements move between the scenes, the soundtrack changes completely without any notice etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Do you have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get a lady from the street to walk around like an idiot! No one will notice the difference! Erm .. <br /> <br /> 10. An "electrifying" climax involving quicksand, snakes (more material from the archives) and a ton of fake blood. Don't forget to insert a stupid "tribal" song either! <br /> <br /> The most sensitive of you, however, will wait for his inevitable appearance on MST3K when this classic TV show will be resurrected and so it will be possible to look at it in the spirit it was intended for. Any other kind of fun derived from this shit is unthinkable .. not to mention impractical. So don't even try. 0/10
