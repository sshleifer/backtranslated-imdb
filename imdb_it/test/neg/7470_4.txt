This film was nothing but an exploitative gay cheesecake. It was not an "art" film; just an excuse to show several free, exploitative, exaggerated scenes with an extended male genital nakedness. There was a dressing room scene that involved over a dozen naked men. The camera enlarges the asses and penises of men while being portrayed for several minutes with their full screen cocks. There are several scenes in this film that show the penis after the penis. It becomes REAL redundant quickly and makes it impossible to take this movie seriously. I was wondering if I was watching a Playgirl video by mistake. If these same scenes were shot using women (eg, completely naked and showing their vaginas repeatedly), they would quickly be dismissed as just softcore porn and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... which is all that this film is. Any artistic merit has dried up in the sewer of the gay ghetto mentality. The themes of class distinction, homosexuality, ardent desire, etc. They were simple and superficial; no more developed than one would expect from a first-year philosophy student. Just go to the point and rent a gay porn instead.
