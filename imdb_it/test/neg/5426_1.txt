Oh my God, she's so stupid. Completely useless, offensive and repulsive. Because the writers have such a problem with the acquisition of Zoey and Chase, we all want them too! in normal shows, there's actually more than one plot conflict on the show, wow, what a concept. furthermore, you can't even distinguish Zoey 101 episodes because the same thing happens every time. Quinn exploits Dustin for a strange thing, Nicole is incredulous and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase insults her all the time, but surprisingly fails to notice, and Logan is an idiot. to repeat. Quinn exploits Dustin for a strange thing, Nicole is incredulous and stupid, Zoey is just a little there, Chase insults her all the time, but surprisingly fails to notice, and Logan is an idiot. to repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the film, once again. so useless NOTHING HAPPENS. it is as if they designed it specifically so that the film could fit between two episodes of the show and the show would have remained completely unchanged after the film's plot.
