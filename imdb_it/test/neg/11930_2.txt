In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel completely separated from everything and everyone. He was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, lethal, indomitable, ambiguous all at once. The original Aeon had layers on layers of depth. He almost never allowed us to show his personal emotions. The original plot was delightfully ambiguous and inspiring. One could never tell what the motives of Aeon were. Aeon was an anarchist militant while Trevor was a radical idealist, so they would never have had any semblance of a stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the film: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works for the monks and his political motivations and personal reasons are very clear. She was pretty, loving, vulnerable, easily domable, emotional and very predictable. The aeon in the film had at most one layer of depth. The plot was obvious and forced. Everything is completely planned for you from the beginning. There was virtually no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least in terms of personal philosophies. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The film was a horrible disappointment for me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters of all time, they squeezed all the depth and personality, and filled them with Hollywood clichés. The essence of the animated series was completely lost in this film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm not giving a "1" movie is because the images were incredible. It was nice to see some of the familiar animated scenes like CGI flying in the eyes.
