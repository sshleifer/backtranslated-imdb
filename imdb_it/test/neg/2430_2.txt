First when does this plot take place? Must take place after the first film because Kuzco knows Pacha and Chicha has his third child but can't take place after the second film because Kronk doesn't have a girlfriend or a wife or something? You never see it on the show. <br /> <br /> Also, why is Kuzco going to school? The whole plot of the show is that Kuzco is going to school so he can be emperor. But wasn't he the emperor before that? And who is the emperor learning to be emperor? Shouldn't it be Yzma? Or was Yzma fired in this timeline? And if this is true, why are you waiting for it not to become an empress? Also, you know that in the first movie he said he was trained from birth to become an emperor by private tutors. So he should know what he's doing. <br /> <br /> Kronk. Why is Kronk a student? He has about 25 years that declared him in the first film. He is an adult who goes to high school. Everyone thinks he's a moron? I really like Kronk but I think because of his age and because everyone knows he is working for Yzma, he should have been a teacher. Being a teacher at Home Ec would be just her alley. <br /> <br /> Malina is very unlikely. Suppose to be Kuzco's love interest / moral compass. But a lot of time, she comes out overbearing and knows everything. He commonly says he thinks I like "I should be proud because I'm cute and smart." <br /> <br /> He has an ESP when he talks about Kuzco and knows every time he is in trouble, when he cheats, or even when he sings Hot Hot Hottie in his head, even if she is rooting for the leader, the school newspaper continues straight A + in all its classes. <br /> <br /> She seems more interested in using her beauty to convince Kuzco to do the right thing and do well in school, then hang out with him. Indeed, it seems more maternal to Kuzco, therefore a love interest. <br /> <br /> Yzma. As I bought before Yzma is trying to dump Kuzco, so she becomes empress. I'm not sure how you are supposed to work with being fired and all. Yzma seems to relive the first film in each episode. In almost every show in which he appears, he transforms Kuzco into an animal in the hope of making him fail a lesson. (There are only 3 times I can think of what didn't happen.) The jokes about whether Yzma is old are not as smart in the show as they were in the movie. And the classic jokes on Yzma are used to die in the show (like "Pulling the level, Krunk!", Roller coaster and the lab). <br /> <br /> Also, some other points that don't make sense in this series. The fact that every time something is given to Kuzco everyone acts as if this assignment made him pass or fail the lesson, but it seems to pass every assignment assigned to him. So why does an assignment matter so much? <br /> <br /> Seriously, who rules the kingdom while it is happening? Do they have a console or an administrator? You never see anyone who rules the kingdom unless Kuzco has regained his powers or Yzma is empress. <br /> <br /> Why does Kuzco go to a normal peasant school? Shouldn't he learn how to drive a country, what to do in case of war or something that will be useful to him in the future? I could see taking normal lessons on how to agriculture (so he would know how to prepare the country for a famine or something like that) but tie a knot? How useful is it? <br /> <br /> Now I know someone is going to say "But don't suppose it makes sense, it must be fun." So they should have more fun things in there. All the fun things about the show have already been done in the movie. Also, if they notice some of these huge holes in the plot, why don't they have fun with them like in the movie? (For example, when Yzma and Kronk arrive at the secret lab before Kuzco and Pacha and Yzma and Kronk can't explain how they got their first one.) <br /> <br /> There are some positive points, it's good to watch some characters from the first film in the series like Bucky and monkey with the bug. Pacha and his family are still very good characters with a good feeling with the earth. I feel this series would be fun for younger children. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, the series is not as good as the film it is based on, but it may be fine for younger children.
