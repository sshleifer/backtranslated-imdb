This film is absurd. Absolutely terrible. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia must have really needed the work to make this film. The plot is not absolutely credible! Michael Keaton agrees to donate bone marrow to the dying son of a detective, but then flees. He manages to evade the police throughout the hospital - not credible that he has so much knowledge of the hospital. He takes an extremely convoluted road out of the hospital, blowing up the power generators and a pedestrian bridge (why?). And in addition, Andy Garcia (father of the dying man) and a doctor help the criminal take the bone marrow. The plot is so crazy! Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen.
