Right on Colmyster. I fully agree with all your feelings and add them. I came to my PC mainly to post a comment on this terrible (less) Bgrade movie. I was about to say that in this day and age I can't understand how anyone could ever make such a painful film - but you beat me about it. Anyone reading this and Colmyster's comment, believe me ---- DON'T MISS TIME AND MONEY. It is absolutely shocking. The acting is totally pathetic, the script is much worse and the special effects (so called) are a joke. Surely no one actually invested money to make this film? I really can't think of anything else to say about this so-called science fiction horror product, but I have to fill this comment to make 10 lines of comment for accepting it for submission.
