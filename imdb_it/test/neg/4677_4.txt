File this in `How are movies like this made? column. An indie version of `Macbeth 'with drag from the 70s, quite faithfully (but unnecessarily) adapted to a conventional unconventional black-comic style. The cast gives a shot, with Christopher Walken calling in eccentricity as McDuff, and with Maura Tierney rising above Pat McBeth's dull script. The other actors are wasted, as is the audience time. Fans of the jerk of this brand of quirk might like it, however. 4 out of 10.
