Very interesting to find another reviewer who had the same reaction to the film as I did: it was much nicer when I was 10 or 11 years old. <br /> <br /> Seeing him more than 30 years later, he is still in place, but he only aroused my interest. What seemed very funny at the time was only slightly fun. <br /> <br /> Also, the things that surprised me like a 10-year-old girl just seemed silly. For example, in one scene, Trinity is walking and shoots his gun behind him and kills two men without even looking. In fact, he doesn't even bother to look and see if they are dead, because he knows he has hit the target. Er, yes, right. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, many dialogues seem quite wooden. Sorry, but 35 years later, it hasn't aged very well. <br /> <br /> Even though it's been a long time since I've seen one, probably a Terrence Hill movie better than this would be my name is nobody.
