This third installment of the Scarecrow series is by far the best. I know, I know ... but how good is it? Well, don't be silly. It's still pretty ugly, but compared to the first two, it's a good movie. Still digital shooting, with decent lighting and good camera work. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> When a college baseball team bites new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Sure, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. In harmony with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred to the scarecrow's body, which comes to life and causes a terrible revenge on, well, practically everyone. The co-editors drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. On the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the scarecrow whistle. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing a much needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama jumps up good and lands in common cheese. Most of the acting was right, but there were some really terrible pieces, including a terrible piece of badly performed lip-synching. Some points of the plot had remained mostly unresolved, and most of them had been used to get someone on their own so they could be slaughtered. Again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.
