The best thing about "The Prey" is the tag line ... "It's not human and has an ax"! The film itself is a stuffed stinkaroo .... endless shots of insects and wild animals make the viewer want to die! No slasher fan will appreciate this garbage ..... Watch "Friday 13" again and burn any copy of this movie you find! <br /> <br /> It is also considered one of the 25 worst films ever made!
