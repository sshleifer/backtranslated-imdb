ok, we have a movie that some call one of the best movies ever ... but I'm sitting here thinking about the devil! f, the storeys sux {that there is no history], the diolouge is quite simple, artistically nothing exceptional! and acting is nothing real, so if you want to pretend to be arty, tell us you like it, but if you have a real vision, you don't like it or if you explained why!
