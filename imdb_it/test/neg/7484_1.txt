I don't often feel strong enough to post something on a movie. This was, however, simply the worst movie I've ever seen. The performances were ridiculous at best, at worst they were, well, there is no other word for this, horrible. Above all the female protagonist who presents herself as a casual sexual proposal must be seen and felt to be believed. Honestly, the plot is meaningless, the dialogue is frightening and the characterization ... there is none. I'm surprised it's not an Alan Smithee movie. I can't stress this strong enough ... avoid at all costs. How come films like this are made? This is not a cheap movie at its worst, much worse.
