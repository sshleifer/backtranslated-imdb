I've seen Heaven's Gate recently. After seeing this epic western of 3 hours and 40 minutes that is not a western, I read Steven Bach's book. After considering all the events and the film itself, I still think this film is a complete waste of time. I believe that when someone tells you to watch it, they are actually trying to bore you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this self-indulgent movie beyond really bad thought, I have to ask you why. Although this is not a reason to hate it, it is historically far away. He pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called Johnson County War. The cattle of the time simply wanted to kill all the cattle thieves and claimed they were all imaginary. You realize that you simply don't care about these people and hope they are killed because, at least then, something would happen. Everyone in the movie talks about things that happen and are never shown. After sitting in this gigantic waste of time you wonder how someone can actually accomplish a 4 hour epic in which nothing happens. Oh, and by the way the Johnson County War was not a war, it never happened. The Johnson County war, in fact, was so named because it almost happened, in fact, 2 people died. I can't warn you enough about this movie. However, if you are like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that has ruined careers and put United artists on the "selling" lot sounds like an interesting case to study, so in effect, look at this terrible, narsisistico , film without subtext and a lot of photography (which sometimes is adorable)
