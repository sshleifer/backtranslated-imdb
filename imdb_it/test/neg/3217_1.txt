It is incredible that this talented actor Chapa has made all these famous stars appear in this dismal, pathetic, mischievous and too long film about a low-life gangster who looks white but half Mexican, most of the acting is bad and many of the well the stars known in this trash film receive a script that seems composed by a sixteen year old, I'm sure this film is the weak point of the career for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey that I'm sure are very embarrassed by the fact that never appeared in this turkey of a movie. I doubt that many people have ever heard of Chapa and after this terrible film I'm sure it will disappear into oblivion to which it belongs.
