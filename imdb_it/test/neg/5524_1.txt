As other reviews have said, another of the countless alien clones, this time with a great parody of The Terminator, add some of the classic SF story "Who Goes There There?", And a stupid plot device raised by The Andromeda Strain (apparently blinking red lights drive the murderous droids that can't find frightened people three centimeters from them). OK, the story: after a sequence of people running in a spaceship and killing each other we get a caption. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". <br /> <br /> The crew of a relay station in orbit on Mars, which will be raised in 48 hours, detects a giant spaceship on a collision course. It is Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It is not a good time to have taken everything that is useful off-line on the relay station to do some repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from its course and is transmitting a message "NOT IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE Enter this ship!" warning. After a lot of screaming at each other, the service station crew fixes something together and takes the station out of the way just in time. But the ship changes course and deceives them in any way - impaling one of the crew members on something impalable by pointy crew. The satellite begins to "lose its integrity". Bit de-pressurize. Much more screaming and running in which only two of the crew get sucked into the backward space. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked backwards?). <br /> <br /> After a few keystrokes, the wheelchair technician (who is called 'Wheeler' - the only detectable joke in the entire film) deduces that Siberia is draining them of all their power and they have to go aboard her and turn off the engines. Everyone goes on board and takes off his helmet. "DO NOT enter this ship!" obviously means getting on board the ship and exposing yourself to infectious diseases possibly fatal. A team heads for the main computer room where they find a dead and frozen boy holding what looks like an American Express card but turns out to be a minidisc. The other team finds some switches. Surprisingly the dead guy turns out to be the father of the attractive female crew member most likely to survive an encounter with a wild alien. They shut down the engines but this means that the naval reactor will explode. A disturbing blow from the point of view begins to kill people. There is a bit of suspicion that Siberia has discovered a new mineral, a source of petitive energy worth millions, which means that the most venal members of the crew immediately throw themselves into danger to get hold of it. The POV shot returns with whoosh! whoosh! the sounds of the soundtrack. Unfortunately these give you the idea that the killer wears corduroy trousers and the effect is wasted. <br /> <br /> Then it's all around and killed in order of ugliness and acting skills, as long as only the obvious survivors survive - along with the likeable dog who managed to kill at least two crew members. Just because hardened space veterans wander among the jaws of certain death in search of their pets, dogs and cats have long been a mystery to this type of film. Other stupid highlights include all those who forget to act on the oxygen levels that fall until they are remembered by the voice of the on-board computer (not that low oxygen levels in no way dampen any of the fires that this load of idiots starts ). If the Killer Droid id is so smart that it can drive the ship into a tight curve and make another attempt to ram the repeater station, because it didn't turn off the message "NOT AT ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, enter this ship!" warning sign .. I'm sure if he was looking for more people to kill, then I'd scream GO AWAY! it was not a good way to go around it. <br /> <br /> Musetta Vander is the only person who can act in any way - all others continually shake their nostrils as they show their teeth and scream and aim guns at each other. It's that kind of script; full of exclamation points - the only thing that kept me looking to the end was the hope that the script would require you to take off all your clothes, or to get wet without wearing much. Unfortunately no. One of the wrong things about this film (apart from having more cyan on the screen than in any other film ever) is that there was no free nudity.
