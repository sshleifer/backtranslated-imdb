This is a disappointing adaptation of James Lee Burke's novel "In the Electric Mist of the Confederate Dead". It is rather bad acted mainly because of the miscellany of the main actors. Tommy Lee Jones, a normally excellent actor, does not simply capture Burke's "Dave Robicheaux". As Robicheaux's main nemesis, John Goodman does a sloppy job like the "heavy". The boy who plays the actor-actor of Robicheaux does not seem a former leader of listener "A". The rest of the film is mostly screened by unnamed local people who don't do justice to a novel of the past. <br /> <br /> Jones's film and performance are too hasty for one thing. In the series of novels by Burke, Robicheaux gives the feeling that it adapts well to its environment most of the time, being relaxed and slow. This is just like the deep south and south of Louisiana. Then sometimes Robicheaux is almost manic in his efforts. Jones moves at a fast pace through the entire movie. He does not vary. Ned Beatty is wasted. Mary Steenburgen is out of place. The only positive thing about this is the setting. Overall the film gives the impression of a TV movie.
