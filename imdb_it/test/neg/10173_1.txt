How can you read the only good comment on this film is made by someone who really looks at his CHURCH! <br /> <br /> However, the film had a good start on science fiction films, everything was there to make a movie that was fun, easy to watch, then everything felt in this religious brainwashing mode of Jesus-save-all. <br /> <br /> The story begins with 2 main characters, 2 reporters, but quickly gives the first role to that maniac of Jesus who is there to save the soul of everyone with this descent attitude. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: this film goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes <br /> <br /> Wasting time, wasting money ... AVOIDING IT
