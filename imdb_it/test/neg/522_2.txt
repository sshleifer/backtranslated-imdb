Ok, I just had to play on this ... Like a terrible mental-gimp, I just passed the film in its entirety. <br /> <br /> You will notice that the trivia section of IMDB points out that parts of the 747 increase were "borrowed" from the 1977 airport. This does not actually scratch the surface ... Virtually all external hits of the plane flowing the ocean, landing, sinking and even the rear shots are borrowed from the '77 airport. All the "elevations" have been pulled since '77, including most of the internal flooding clips, with the exception of Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help wondering if Olivia Dehavilland could float at any moment, or maybe a "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another eye-roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which is to compensate for the fact that the airport 77 aircraft is owned by Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmie Stewart, of course). <br /> <br /> This is a real calvalcade of actors who don't work much, or at least haven't worked for a while, which may have been the first clue that it would have been a real stinker. <br /> <br /> I voted this movie for 2 - It's quite worthy of a "1", but if this movie can't offer any other quality of redemption, at least someone has helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver to make payments with their month car!
