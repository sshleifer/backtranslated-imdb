UGH! ... this is the worst Wrestlemania with hands down .... there are no good matches ..... Hulk Hogan raises his bald and tanned head once again in the main event, the fairy tale of spot hoggin light ! .... not a thing worthy of note for this tape, oh ... I'll take it back ... this is Jim Ross' first WM ... but other than that ... it has nothing worth it to see .... a big bust ... <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars WOOF !!!
