A strange and deliberately distorted biopic of Dyan Thomas in which we hear little more than a dozen verses of his poetry. Instead we have to endure an exposition of raw character seen through the prism of his proto-pottery relationship with his wife (Sienna Miller) and infantile love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough charm to vaccinate us against his restless altruism, and Cillian Murphy composes the persistently tense mourning. <br /> <br /> The film never seems to decide where it is going. There is no arc even like a viaduct from one end of the war to the other. Maybury seems much more interested in his two female parts (which they wouldn't !?) than in the man who brings them together and then divides them. Miller is the choice of the two (I found Knightley competent at best but I never found her nice), but both offer terribly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other amusing decisions include too much for the irrelevant character of William (Murphy), artistic production (eg. Double crossfade) which is neither impressionist nor symbolic and the old brown act of the period film that does not merge. 4/10
