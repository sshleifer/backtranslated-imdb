Two films: "the fifth element", "armageddon". The same topic: saving the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: "Armageddon" is much inferior to the Luc Besson film. Some spectacular special effects fail to hide a tiring and globally conventional script. Several parts of the film are showing it. I think of the president's speech and especially of Willis's relationship with his daughter, "Grace". At the beginning of the film, it tends to neglect it and to protect it and this makes it tired. Then, at the end of the film, it is the true love and understanding that shines through him. On the other hand, the film falls into the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the film tries to be funny but the result does not work because the humor introduced in the film is often rough and rather low level whereas in the "fifth element", humor was crazy, involuntary and enabled to neglect the serious action. The film suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into ridicule (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are misused. Bruce Willis is the complete opposite of his "fifth element" character. He plays the man-man, greets him and, at times, is unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their roles, in particular, the sinking team Willis. It looks like this crew is here just for fun. One of these is considered very qualified, but he seems crazy. And poor Liv Tyler! It is to NASA just to be decorative. <br /> <br /> When the film was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed his fatigue in saving the world. His tiredness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor film.
