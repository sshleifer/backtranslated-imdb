I've seen almost all of Kurosawa's films and dozens of other Japanese films. Compared to these other films, this is a rather mediocre film. The plot presents two brothers in war - none of whom I cared much - and it is very confusing to keep up with those who are allies with whom. Music and cinematography are pretty good, but special effects are sometimes terrible - rubber heads fly with the same realism as the average high school game! In addition to these complaints, the end of the film completely ends DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire image. It turns out that the end is not true but has been completely "shaken". What's the point of this, then? If you've seen this movie, you understand that there are MANY better films out there, so don't give up!
