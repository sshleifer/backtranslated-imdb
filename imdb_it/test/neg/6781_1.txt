One of the worst shows of all time. The show would begin with intelligent comments and mutual comments that would have been totally off the wall and not required. The plump computer was unbelievable, the bible's duck, the bad girl, who are these actors ??? Never heard of any of them except Cole who was absolutely amazing in the part. Every time he opens his mouth you expect to hear "see children ..." Pulling the plug was a mercy that killed for this horrible show. The stories were as incredible as the actors. Lame would be the best way to describe it. Somehow this show makes a bullet like Ice-T more credible as a cop, and he wrote the worst song of cops ever recorded.
