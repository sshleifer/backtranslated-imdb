I was looking for a documentary of the same journalistic quality as Frontline or "Fog of War" (by Errol Morris). Instead I was stunned by this superficial and naive description of a very complex and disturbing man and his regime: Alberto Fujimori. This film should be called "Fujimori's Return". The director assumes that he made a "perfect" film because it removes factions both pro and anti-Fujimori when in reality it is a very biased and unprofessional work. <br /> <br /> The film has some crucial facts wrong: <br /> <br /> 1) It uses the so-called "landslide" elections of 1995 in which Fujimori was re-elected with 65% of the votes, as an example of the massive popular support of Fujimori. But we all know that we are the result of a highly organized election fraud. <br /> <br /> 2) The film states that Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) killed 60,000 people. Indeed, the final report of the Truth Commission states that there were 69,280 deaths due to political violence in Peru. 33% of those were caused by SL. This leaves the remaining 67% in the hands of the police, the military and other groups. The fact that you use the same misleading information that Fujimori has been using for 10 years is another example of how terrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> For anyone with some education on Peruvian politics and history, Fujimori is clearly a consummate manipulator, a delusional character and a self-centered unapologetic. His regime was far from democratic. It is still a threat to the Peruvians. Despite these facts, the director lets Fujimori tell the story. Not just how he wants to position the camera, but the narrative and direction of the film seem to be part of his political agenda. He always seems to have the last word. There are no journalistic "cojones", only soft questions and undisputed observations. Where is Oriana Fallaci when we need her? The director, questioned after the screening, does not hide the fact that he was deeply impressed by Fujimori, by his charm and intelligence. Yes, she was definitely fascinated by him, and you can understand it by watching this movie. It is obvious that you have a very difficult time to digest the multitude of facts that indicate your responsibility for corruption, murder and the deception that has taken place. He assured the panting public that Fujimori was indeed a "patriot" when a few moments before, one of the leading Peruvian journalists was very adamant in telling us that Fujimori was, above all, a "traitor". He went on to say that despite all the accusations, "a single dollar" was not found on any bank account on his name, etc. Etc. It was like hearing again the same band of ruthless thugs who ruled the country for 10 years defending their master. It was a sad moment for journalism. <br /> <br /> This film makes history injustice. It is an insult to hundreds of people who died, disappeared or unjustly imprisoned by the Fujimori regime. No wonder he later confessed that all Peruvian intellectuals he made friends with during the making of the film felt betrayed. Impartial? The words "opportunistic", "naive" and "refusal" come to mind.
