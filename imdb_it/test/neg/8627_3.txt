A real insult to the original "Spoorloos", which is one of the most disturbing films (and I mean it as a compliment!) I have seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is chilling and brilliant, the remake is flat and even boring, in particular the "happy end" ending takes away the little suspense that was in this film in the first place. <br /> <br /> While such a distortion (especially the grafting of a "happy end" that was not present previously) is quite common in "Hollywood" remakes of European arthouse films and could be expected , the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this mess was created by the same director who made the original "Spoorloos" ... <br /> <br /> Because Mr. Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece so such is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Avoid this abomination at all costs, as it could ruin the original for you even if looked * after * that, let alone the opposite ...
