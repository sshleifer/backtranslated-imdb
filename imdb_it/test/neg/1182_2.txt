I stopped watching this movie in half. It was just terrible! Boring and invented secondary textures. A complete lack of the pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback portrait of Ed Gein. A film doesn't have to be historically accurate, but the real story of Ed Gein is much more interesting than this third-class melodrama completely invented for no good reason! Ed Gein played by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. Attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are only weak exercises in a recycled style. And this film wanted to be elegant, but it even ruined everything. Fortunately, there is a better film of this story. Ed Gein from 2001 told the story efficiently and offered a little chills when we looked at a sick man who was not in control of himself. Steve Railsback, who played Ed Gein at the time, was already famous for having memorably portrayed another famous serial killer: Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is the one to see. Avoid this mess.
