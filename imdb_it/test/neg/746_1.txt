Flickering hand-held cameras (this piece was shot on television, but you are not a movie) not only keep you in mind of how horrible cinematography is in this film, but make you absolutely unable to immerse yourself in the story. Poor Miss Austen must roll into her grave. All I can say is that if you enjoyed the novel, stop here, until the BBC creates one of their intelligent and sensible masterpieces of the period (like Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth, who, speaking for what I imagine in my notice, Austen would have worshiped). The BBC would never dare to pass Indigo Girl's cheesy saxophone solos for a shot at a historic castle and a loving hug. Giles Foster seemed to be often confused by the fact that they were editing the music on The Specialist. If you want Austen as you love her, look for the BBC logo ...
