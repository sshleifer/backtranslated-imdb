Personally, I have no problem with acting, nor with the script. I have a problem with the giant bird. It was simply AWFUL. Simple and simple. <br /> <br /> The first impulse is to laugh when you see it. What were they thinking !? Budget be damned. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. <br /> <br /> Of course, in my opinion, if the producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, they would have the special effect that people would find much better beast. Oh good. What's done is done. This will be the case with the eternal joke about them that was not wanted.
