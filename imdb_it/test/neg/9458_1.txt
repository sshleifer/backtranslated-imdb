Ah yes, it is yet another classic tale, "a sociopathic homicidal doctor creates the female Frankenstein and falls in love". <br /> <br /> Of the same director who brought you such timeless classics as "10,000 Maniaci" (no, not the group) and "Blood Feast", this "unfinished" film practically yells for the MST3K treatment. The doctor's assistant also has nuances of Torgo from the classic "Manos: The Hands Of Fate". I don't know if the graphics, if the fake violence or the frequent tensions of boredom without dialogue could have scared the crew, though. <br /> <br /> The main reasons to worry about sitting through this film are for the hysterical "hypnosis" scene, the ridiculously serious ending and the fund's production values. I actually saw all the credits after this movie, for the same reasons you are inclined to slow down your car when you have a serious car accident. That is the pure genius of the final theme that sounds like a "My Favorite Things" watered down on a toy piano. Goblin this is not.
