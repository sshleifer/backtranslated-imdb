although this film was fine. I don't think it was fantastic. It was a bit too slow for my taste. A lot of drama, but not a lot of action until the end of the film. , not until the end. For me, the scenes of the dam that burst and the water that floods the city was fine, but too short. The film itself is done well, the acting is decent, but in the long run it didn't do it for me. I thought it had something to do with the fact that there was very little suspense or tension built up through the whole movie. At least that's what I think. The other factor is that I had recently seen '10.5 'and its sequel '10 .5: Apocalypse'.These are 2 big-budget action films, which, in my opinion , are a very difficult act to follow, in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction. as a result, I have to evaluate the 4/10 Killer Flood: the Day the Damn Broke
