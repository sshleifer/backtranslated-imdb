very disappointing and inconsistent - every once in a while a germ of an idea developed and was discarded in the next line - it felt like a movie that had been cut and clipped to try to make it work - I was bored and distracted to the end, and I'm talking like a big fan of the series. Many of the jokes were not very original and tired, the medieval section went on too long and the quality of the acting was very poor - some in the small guest spots, like Simon Peg and Liam Cunningham did more in their 30 seconds assigned than to the main cast done in 90 Min. <br /> <br /> It's a shame, really. <br /> <br /> The only really interesting thing was to take a look inside the small shed of Soho Square - which is something that anyone is ever in that part of London wonder about.
