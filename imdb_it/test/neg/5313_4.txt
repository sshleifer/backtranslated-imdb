John Travolta takes up the role of Chili Palmer, a Hollywood gangster who now turns his gaze to the world of music. Using his "negotiation skills", he tries to manage an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get a successful record from his young singer (Christina Milian). <br /> <br /> Before seeing this sequel, I had heard it was a terrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a pleasant comedy even if it is not as good as the original. The film focuses on the music industry this time instead of the film industry. The music business is portrayed very badly in the film and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can't say if this was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a good job of spoofing the film industry. The same cannot be said for the sequel and the attempts have become lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what saves the film from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see it in a different kind of role. Vince Vaughn also offers a fun show, even though it started to get boring before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman offers an average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and does a fine job. His performance is a bit boring though. Christina Milian does a horrible performance and isn't even good as a singer. Cedric the Entertainer offers a good performance even if it's not in the movie for a long time. There are also a lot of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray directs and does a bad job. He simply doesn't handle the film very well and the film is a bit of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and after a while it became annoying. Even at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are many slow spots. The film had to be modified badly and clearly it was not. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to overcome the weak direction and script and provide some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while at other times it was really fun. Compared to the original, the sequel does not measure well. However, Be Cool is a pretty innocuous and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rent and that's it. Rated 6/10
