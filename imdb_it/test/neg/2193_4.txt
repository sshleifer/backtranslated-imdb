Now I've seen two films by director Chen Kaige, a very good one (Farewell My Concubine), and the bad one, The Assassin. Both films describe crucial events in Chinese history, FMC in the 20th century and TA the first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC falls in love with memorable characters, stunning photography, compelling sets, good acting and an interesting story. The Assassin fails on almost every level (okay, the sets are fantastic, the cinematography is good, and the few battle scenes are pretty exciting). But ... pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you thought that Saving Private Ryan was too pathetic, know that this one will make you sick. Dialogue is lifeless, many lines look like political declarations, subtle or amusing is not this photo. The film is overwhelmed by its pomposity. I'm really surprised that the Assassin gets such high marks here on imdb. 4/10
