A bad movie on a bad movie. Is it original or what? If it is, then this is the only positive thing. The adorable Ally Sheedy could not prevent this bomb from destroying cinemas and video recorders everywhere. It should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by the character of Danny Aiello were announced as themselves, as were the characters they played in her D-rated movie. To call it a B-rated movie is too much of a compliment, and would lead to disappointments of grandeur.
