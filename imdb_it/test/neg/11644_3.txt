Jim Brown performs and produces a story set in the Philippines immediately after the Japanese invasion. The story sees the Japanese taking several sailors prisoners including some divers, who they use to retrieve the gold that MacArthur had dumped in Manila Bay. <br /> <br /> It is a messy film that aims to make a statement about war and racism (The film uses Edwin McCain's war in a not so subtle montage). The performances are simply adjusted to the best. Jim Brown is fine, but he doesn't really show any kind of range in a performance that makes him look annoyed. The sets are useful but they seem pretty cheap. The film suffers from the beginning because of a large amount of repertoire material that includes many of the best known shots of the Japanese Tora attack! Tora! Tora! The use of such a large budget sequence makes the rest of the film decidedly anemic; also remember that there are better films out there that you can see. For me the film seems to have a half real plot, the recovery of silver and a half plot that is there just to fill the time. None of this is particularly exciting even with the explosive finish. <br /> <br /> Given the choice, I would make a pass.
