The silly dialogue in this series has been mentioned by others and I agree. <br /> <br /> If mother and daughter were really so keen, they should be the Queen and Princess of the Universe, don't kick in some small town. <br /> <br /> I really tried to watch some episodes, but when the witty pop who mumbles the pop culture starts to turn the channel. <br /> <br /> I saw a bit of a new episode to see if something had changed (for the best I had hoped for) but no, the same old "we're so smart with our references to pop culture" that I almost traded. <br /> <br /> Longtime fans who are not happy that the new seasons could be just weaning and getting sick of the regurgitated purgative that never stops.
