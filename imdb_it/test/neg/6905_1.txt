Words cannot describe how horrible this film is. Well, maybe they can. I'll take a stab: 1 - Pitiful. Hollywood makes the most talking animals set in the graphics. Apparently script and plot are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Movies for children, but one of the characters is brutally attacked and killed. <br /> <br /> 3 - Blatantly stupid. The film is actually depicting farm animals as having human abilities. At Nemo, the fish could talk, but most are still fish. We only listen to English as a translation. At Barnyard, animals actually speak English that other people can understand. <br /> <br /> 4 - Unexplained - No clever plot or even intelligent humor. (OK, the 13-year-old dog on crutches was fun). <br /> <br /> 5 - Culturally insensitive - The "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. The pink cow is played by a white actress. The black cow was playing a stereotypical black person. <br /> <br /> 6 - Ignorant - I am not a male cow I know of. I think we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to drek, they might even have the simplest facts. <br /> <br /> 7 - Boring and Borish. My 4 year old left us after 45 minutes. He practically falls asleep. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this film will make millions, which is unfortunate, because it shows Hollywood producers that the American public in general is just full of suckers waiting to pay 8 dollars just to get some of peace and tranquility from the children for an hour or two. An unfortunate circumstance. Because producers should spend real money when returns are the same in both cases.
