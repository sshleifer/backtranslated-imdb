No surprise except in the speed with which ABC reacted to the depressing votes. According to published reports (Variety) the show has garnered the worst judgments in the history of the ABC television network. <br /> <br /> And I quote: the ABC music competition "The One" opened Tuesday night to cancel the evaluations. <br /> <br /> The article went on to say that the show received an "incredibly low rating of rating / 3 for adults 18-49 and 3.08 million viewers overall." <br /> <br /> This makes the premiere weaker for any reality show on any network and even below all the bows of the series in the ABC story. <br /> <br /> From the first moment I saw the advertisements for this, I knew it would fail. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a good chance of success.
