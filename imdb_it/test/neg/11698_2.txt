This film has strayed too far from the Straub novel to make me enjoy it. Just arrived in the middle of the film. In addition to turning Don Wanderly from Edwards into a son of his son, most of the main scenes were removed and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. What was left was rubbish. Straub's version was far superior to this poorly executed film. I don't think casting has done a great job in choosing Chowder Society members. I hope someone will come and make the film correctly in my life. I only hate when Hollywood slaves the works of talented authors because they think their version is much better. It makes me sick.
