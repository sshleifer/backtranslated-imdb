I thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish watching it. The premise was too silly and predictable. I didn't go very far in the film. <br /> <br /> Let me see. Obviously she is older than the taxi driver (unless she is much younger than she looks). He is black and she is white. He makes more money than he (he's just a taxi driver). There are 3 statistically failed bankruptcy unions all in one and we should pretend to have a chance in hell. It would be better to marry the boy who does not love. <br /> <br /> I saw it only partially because I love MJW as an actor. His acting was superb. You, meh! It was OK but the premise is too stupid. I didn't see the end. I didn't make it, so I don't know if it ended differently from the way I predicted the ending would be. I can't imagine any black woman who loves this movie. There is something disgusting to see a black man looking after a white woman like that. And an old one for that. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
