If you are a Christian or a Jew who hopes to see an accurate biblical representation (or Torah) of the Exodus events, you will be disappointed by this movie. In typical Hollywood style, people who are not even in the Bible have been "created" to support characters and play an important role in the film. Jethro's role has completely changed and becomes nothing more than a discouraging father-in-law in place of a pastor pastor who gave Moses excellent advice. God is largely removed from the film, and instead viewers have the impression that Moses should understand things for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This film is a typical humanistic turn on biblical things and tries to put most of the responsibility on Moses to try to understand what God wants and what it should do. Those who know the Exodus book well will see not only the inconsistencies in the film, but obvious changes evident in the events. Above all, they will see an almost total absence of God's dialogue with Moses, which determines all that Moses does after the burning bush. Far from being alone as portrayed in the film, Moses is guided by God with detailed and direct communication. <br /> <br /> Even the Hallmark does not seem to recognize the direct role of God, and without his words spoken to Moses many events make no sense. To compensate, Hallmark has actually changed a few things. For example, after the golden calf, God afflicts the people and must look at the symbol of a snake to live. The distinctive sign instead creates a civil war and the Israelites take sides, then they slaughter each other. The side of Moses naturally wins. <br /> <br /> The film may not have a minimum value for non-believers, since it could lead them to seek answers, but believers should stay away. Twisted events and changes make this a danger to anyone not familiar with their Bible. Read Exodus for yourself, there are no substitutes.
