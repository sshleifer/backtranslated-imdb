I was all enchanted by the film watching the promos and went to see it FDFS The film was horrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until they go to London things are fun but slowly the rhythm fades. and there is nothing funny about it <br /> <br /> The Manoj Joshi subplot is fun in places but it's undesirable and adds to the boredom <br /> <br /> The drug side is fun, especially the Govinda's monologue <br /> <br /> The film goes on and on aimlessly as a small child wrote it <br /> <br /> The interval brings a turning point in history but by then I lost hope < br /> <br /> The second part starts well, but the way things are handled makes a fool around The whole Arbaaz-Jackie corner is half-baked Furthermore, why don't people identify them? <br /> <br /> The climax is pretty funny for how stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in its elements, from this film he started making craps and his films are bad and bad. The music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stands out and AFREEN too Camera-work I am beautiful <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar has a white beard and looks old but he does well even though this role has done so many times, but thanks to his natural comedy things seem bearable Govinda seems out of shape, bad and his act except the monologue is boring too surprising from Govinda it seems too much pressure on him to return and Priyan fails to use it Paresh goes well in some parts but in complex just repeat Manoj Joshi is fun in places Sharat Saxena is ok Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts in sleep Arbaaz Khan is ugly Lara Dutta screams for glory but fails to act
