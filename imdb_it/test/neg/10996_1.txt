Bad editing, bad production values, bad continuity, implausible, bad dialogue ... this film is bad, bad, bad. However, if you want a movie to be fun (on the MST3000), this is your movie. I wouldn't recommend spending a lot of money on this, but if you see this movie, make sure there are plenty of witty and like-minded friends.
