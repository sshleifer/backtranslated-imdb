Even though the film looks quite elegant for an indie made on a really low budget, it's not what I go to in movies. There was not one character that I found sympathetic, everyone seemed to be absolutely unlucky losers. Everything they try ends badly, it is too desperate for me. Reviews refer to the Puffy Chair as a black comedy ... comedy? Brother Rhett behaves like a fugitive from an institution. When Josh talks to girl Emily about his brother, he almost reminds Rhett not to play with a complete deck. Nevertheless, Josh performs a "marriage" for Rhett and a woman whom Rhett met a few hours earlier. There were some interesting performances by some of the characters encountered on the road. However for me the most significant thing is that people were leaving the movie ... and I saw it at a free screening.
