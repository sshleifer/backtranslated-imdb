There are some great Canadian films. There are some crap. Last night, I watched one of those crap. It wasn't the typical Canadian movie where he tried to be so different from being arty. This film tried to be a type of Hollywood gangster movie. It was terrible. <br /> <br /> From the beginning I had the feeling that it would be a bad movie. He had some of the sweetest dialogues a movie could have. There was this voice for a scene and then it never came back. This always annoys me, when filmmakers simply use the voice when they can't think of another creative way of telling a story. <br /> <br /> I know I'm in Canadian cinema, I should support my brothers, but this movie is rubbish. The premise is something like an unrealistic Soprano episode. The father of a mafia boss of a banker is on his deathbed and orders his son to legitimize the business. Not so original. And the workers complain about it, but they just think that soon they will have no more work like nothing. To do this legitimately they use extortion. Irony. But not the good guy. Then a strange girl with an Elvis wig and a birthmark covering half her face steals the main character and raped him. Anyway, this guy for whatever reason now loves to dress up as girls. Then this banker hooks up with a prostitute when he has a beautiful future wife at home. But he falls in love with the prostitute because the prostitute dresses like a man and puts on her clothes. He blackmails him with some photos of him wearing bra and panties. Yet he still loves her. He also has no reason to leave her boyfriend, but he does it to be with the prostitute. <br /> <br /> For a film about the organization of crime and sexual fetish, there was neither action nor sex. It was like a Cinemax porn movie late at night without good things. The aspiring sex scenes were not hot or sexy. It was all too delightful. The film had nothing to do, only the lame plot. <br /> <br /> I don't think it was the actor's fault. I think they have a terrible script to work with. What was most shocking were the ridiculous characters. The bad boy's name was Uncle Bunny or something. But the name was not important. They were all clich√©s. The dialouge was ridiculous throughout the film, and the other film-goers laughed out loud in some of the "serious" moments of the film. So the worst of everything. It had to be the cheapest end. If you remember that you played shooting as a kid with imaginary guns or toy guns. This was basically the ending of the film. But I was more than happy that it was over, and I had to warn my Canadian comrades not to waste time or money watching this movie.
