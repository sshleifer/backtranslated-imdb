Now we know where they got the idea of ​​Snakes on a Plane. To put it bluntly, don't pay to watch this movie. If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, then take the cable or take it for free from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Don't pay to rent this. If you pay to rent this, then you are a stupid individual. The acting was horrible, the plot was horrible, everything was horrible except for the snakes. If they were real or generated by CGI, they looked pretty good. But having said that, however, this film must be one of the worst films I've ever seen. Even the bare dance scene was pretty bad that I actually made it fast forward. Don't sit down, I didn't warn you.
