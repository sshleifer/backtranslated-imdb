The recent release of "Mad Dog Morgan" on Troma DVD is disappointing. This appears to be a censored press for television viewing. Some of the most violent scenes have been modified and some parts of the colored language have been removed. Anyone who has seen the uncut movie will be crazy about this toxic version of DVD. "Mad Dog Morgan" deserves to be released on DVD in the original version of the film. However, even if published on DVD, the film is still one of the best portraits of bushranger life in nineteenth-century Australia. After visiting the Old Melbourne Gaol, with the death masks of the condemned exhibitors, it is "Mad Dog Morgan" that comes to mind.
