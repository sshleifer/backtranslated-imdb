How do you make a film totally unattractive from a story of one of America's most famous authors? Watch this movie and find out. Maybe I'm overestimating the author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed with "The heart is a lone hunter" and I was hoping for something memorable here too. Forget it. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with short hair and clothes. I never found her very excited in almost every movie, anyway. Rod Steiger as a preacher? How offensive is it? Unlikely characters, one after another. Well, maybe this is also the book, and I'm unfair to this movie. I am not familiar with the story except the one I saw on the screen and this was such an unattractive film that I could never recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> It's just one person back in the other, in a backward city. Outside of some good cinematography here and there, there is nothing to recommend. How anyone can sit for 100 minutes of this is fantastic. <br /> <br /> I didn't even go to talk about how bad it is. There is good news: this was the only film directed by Simon Cowell.
