Ask thousands of people what the greatest unintended comedy of all time is, and they will almost invariably tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Outer Space. They are wrong. American Ninja has shot down these two turkeys for a variety of reasons, not least the fact that it was a script that was clearly not designed. While I fully support the B image industry to keep jobs like Michael Dudikoff in work, a little work on the product would have come a long way. <br /> <br /> For those who give the rear to a mouse, my next paragraphs will give away significant parts of the plot. <br /> <br /> First of all, when we are given some basic information about the titular hero, we will be given his date of birth, close relatives, parents and so on. they are all unknown I don't know about you, but I expect the US military to take the search for facts about its staff a little more seriously. Moreover they manage to ruin the continuity of the dates quite effectively, even if I don't remember well which dates were wrong and when. This is actually one of the less obvious defects of American Ninja. <br /> <br /> It has already been pointed out, but a common failure of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted with a large number of antagonists, they claim the antagonists attack one at a time. More recent films like The Matrix Reloaded challenge this convention, but almost all the films of the 80s have the audience screaming "hey, why don't you attack all at once ??" Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when the fights are more extensive than one-on-one. <br /> <br /> The central premise was originally a joke, but in light of recent events in which the US military cannot crush a crowd of insurgents simply because they will not delegate to specialists, it seems strangely ironic. Phillipino's renegades are stealing weapons from the local US Army division for sale to wealthy clients. It doesn't matter that such a theft would push the army to give responsible, or even believed responsible, local rectal aerial businessmen, after all this is a 1980 action movie. <br /> <br /> Di by far the funniest part of the film is the culminating battle, however. While Joe and Jackson run combining pose and combat in an art form, the evil Ninja begin to explode without a seemingly clear reason. I agree with a previous commentator that this film should have been called Ninja Holocaust, because I am willing to bet that at least three hundred malicious ninjas will bite it during the movie's running time. Furthermore, the Black Star Ninja begins to fight with rocket launchers, laser beams and all sorts of ridiculous tools that are not only ill-conceived, but are poorly planned. You'll never see a laser beam effect that seems cheaper. <br /> <br /> What is at the top is that the film takes itself so seriously. During the scene where Joe meets again with his old mentor, I challenge the viewer not to laugh at the horrid dialogue. Not that I know of any modern Ninjitsu pragmatist, but the logical part of my imagination finds it hard to believe that they talked like this at any time in their history. During this mentoring scene, I expect the old man to tell Joe that he must demonstrate his manhood by cutting off his head with a blunt plastic spoon. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave American Ninja a 1. This is a special score in my system because it's reserved for the worst, scariest, most offensive movies I've ever seen, or for movies that they make me laugh without even bothering to try. American Ninja is certainly an example of the latter.
