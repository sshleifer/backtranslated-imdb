This is one of those films with great potential. Brilliant actors, a debut by a very interesting director and a disturbing plot "Survivor". <br /> <br /> But it doesn't work at all. <br /> <br /> To start with the good thing: Cinematography is amazing. The beauty of the Namibian desert shows itself as a ruthless surround, even in images. And then there's acting. Very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his "Short Cuts" character from Altman. <br /> <br /> So the disappointments: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why does Levring choose "Lear" for their game? The whole idea of ​​letting Shakespeare articulate their desperation and inner desires doesn't work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that the tragedies occur because of the choice of "Lear". They just have to fit into the screenplay of Oscar-winning Anders Thomas Jensen and Levring. <br /> <br /> And sex. It takes about three days, so more or less all the characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh !! Sex is always the easiest way when you need a crisis in a plot. The part of Janet McTeer totally collapses, mainly because of that ridiculous idea. Sex immediately drops the plot on the ground. Instead they could focus on dialogue. There must have been a conversation between all the characters, but we see them mainly talking in smaller groups. Their talk however died as "Lear" and the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> "The King Is Alive" is not yet the worst Danish film of 1995. But comparing it with the most recent of the 19me dogme '95 "Italiensk for begyndere" by Lone Scherfig, this fails badly. It's not a good movie. It's ugly. But it's beautiful.
