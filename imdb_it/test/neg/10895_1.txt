This film must be the biggest disappointment I've ever seen in a movie. The acting is horrible, the suspense piles up in the least and the plot is ridiculous overall. I found myself rooting for the victim to hurry up and become a victim, because obviously he needed to be put out of his unhappiness. Anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of how the world works will be immediately disgusted by the jumps we are asked to do in logic, and the so-called build up of suspense would have been lucky to have a 3-year-old child to be slightly worried. I am dismayed that a sequel is planned, because it means that they will ask us once again to swallow a comparable plot. If this is an example of Raw Feed's work, I think I will avoid all future films from them.
