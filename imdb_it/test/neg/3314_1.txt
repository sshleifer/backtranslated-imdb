It's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good production values ​​and decent acting. There is a good job here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately they suffer from what plagues much of modern gay cinema; recycled plots, too familiar devices (I saw the "pool" set too often in gay male films) and hackneyed scripts. The most striking of all is "Dorothy", whose absurd premise is that a cute young man will have trouble getting laid in New York because of the shortage of gay boys available in his vicinity. <br /> <br /> In terms of cinema, these shorts play like little special offers for gay children. Not much imagination in their writing or execution; in practice they follow a target shooting, stroke / reaction / master stroke that becomes painfully boring after about five minutes. There is hope for queer cinema in the works of Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning and the late, great Marlon Riggs ... but not here. These films are incredibly middlebrow, singularly whitebread and their values ​​fundamentally support a gay bourgeois sensibility. That's probably why they sound so good at gay film festivals.
