It's nice to see Julie Andrews play a drastic dramatic role here - something she hadn't done in a while - but her character Judith (wise they didn't try to pass her off as a 'Judy') has the old man refined the ways and Tomboy hairstyle of yesteryear, and Andrews acts 'adult' like any other actress would interpret frigid. It is a surprisingly bland drama set in Barbados involving Omar Sharif (not the most lively protagonist around - not even in 1974!) Hoping to make Andrews a spy while he slowly led her into the proverbial bedroom. The non-memorable output has some field value: titles similar to James Bond at the beginning are a taste of cheese. As for Julie: it's quiet and contemplative, but this doesn't do much for the public, or for the film. Blake Edwards covers the matter like a funeral. * from ****
