This film was a thorough diappointment. There was no development of history. Viewers were thrown into history without explanation and left to themselves in an attempt to understand what was happening. The action sequences were ok but confusing. They weren't The Matrix and they weren't crouching Tiger. This movie is best left to cable TV where you don't have to pay to see it or convince a friend that they should take it and then go over and watch it. As a big Jet Li fan, I expected more. How can anyone involved in Once Upon a Time in China put his name in this ???
