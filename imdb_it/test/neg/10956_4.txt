This is a decidedly bad b-movie. In reality it is really a much better quality than many films b. He had a consistent script, a decent direction, cinematogrpahy, and I saw worse acting. The zombies were fantastic, clearly these were Romero zombies, and it was really an interesting zombie story. Obviously not the Oscar material, and if you're not into the zombie movies, or the b-movies you probably won't like this, but if you like this movie. <br /> <br /> The main clint eastwood knockoff is good enough, though they never clearly explain how it can cure itself of gunshots and zombie bites. But if it has more than one line of dialogue than where its bad acting is really evident. <br /> <br /> It was a good ending, at least I thought so. Romero should be flattered if he ever saw him.
