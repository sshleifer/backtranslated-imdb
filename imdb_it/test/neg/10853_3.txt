A very bad film, an amalgam of clich√©s and historical inaccuracies. Some examples: in a first phase the Soviet infantry is attacked by the Germans; instead of remaining in their trenches to shoot at them, they advance in open land to fight them, contrary to all infantry tactics; Kate, one of the main characters, is presumably the daughter of a white Russian and obsessed with his Russian, yet he doesn't speak Russian; a German aviator hit by guilt attacks an anti-aircraft gun - the gun, however, does not throw shrapnel from a bullet but marks a direct blow on his' plane, which does not look much like a German WWII aircraft. In all honesty, when they could escape the absurd plot and the consequent absurdities there are some really powerful moments - the representation of people who are slowly dying of hunger is made in a convincing and moving way, but these show only the rest even more. A film to avoid.
