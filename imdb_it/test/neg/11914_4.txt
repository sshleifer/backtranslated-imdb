Not even one of the Monograms is better (he's not trying to be funny here). The Shanghai Cobra has a lot to offer, but in the end, it's too confusing and messy to be overly satisfying. The film opens with a murderer named Cobra from Shanghai who has already hit twice and is now in a scene in a restaurant somehow. We have a boyfriend, a girl, and another guy who has some implicit connection when a guy dies in the streets. Yes, I'm simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, because this is really at the heart of the problems with this film - it has too many things without a true and satisfactory explanation. I didn't even go to the diner chef who has a bit of involvement and a juke box that talks to you and has a screen and everyone doesn't seem to have a problem with that! All this is in the first five minutes or so. Then Chan enters the cinema working for the government and flying out to help a friend. He also has the right to check a bank's radio shop and is looking for a man wrapped in bandages who helped arrest Shanghai many years before. I found the plot very involved as previously stated. Toler is back as Chan. He is always affable. Benson Fong and Mantan Moreland are also back. Both do a good job and are quite fun. But the twisted plot didn't convince me and much of the film was looked at with a strange and questioning look. This is not a bad movie, not only very interesting, except for the most devoted fans of Chan.
