I imagine the film was based on a heavy book. Given the number of characters and subplots during Katyn, I thought that the creators of the film, perhaps the writer or director, intended to create an epic film. But in reality there was not enough time to spend adequately to develop characters or stories. Aggravating, there were many unrelated secondary stories that could have been modified. <br /> <br /> In reporting the events leading to the mass murder of all these intellectuals and officers, I don't think the film explains any reason why murder was necessary. Was he political? Philosophical? Vengeance? The interesting part of historical films is seeing personal motivations or emotions. Instead, the killers of Katyn looked like automatons, controlled entirely by Stalin, who occasionally appears framed as a charcoal drawing. The portrait of Russians and Germans seemed entirely one-dimensional. (Are the Poles so angry with the Russians?) In addition to being poorly edited and biased or at least unrealistic, the choices of music and cinematography have been at odds with each other and with the film itself. I don't think you can really shoot an epic war movie or a war event with a camcorder. (But if the director followed a story based on the characters, perhaps focusing on a single family, perhaps the approach at hand would have worked better.) And if you use really dramatic music, it must be better balanced with the kind of shots made.
