I love movies, all genres and from big dollar shows to small independent projects. But even considering this 25-year-old piece of rubbish and his attempt to pay tribute to the 1950s, he almost suffers in appearance, with which we judge films. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, I was reminded of several "student films", I had the chance to watch, efforts where creativity is required to fill the gaps in which funds are needed. <br /> <br /> All in all, there are many possibilities for use for 90 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> 2/10
