I consider myself a discreet sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in my chair. <br /> <br /> It's so bad that it couldn't have been worse. Not once have I laughed at the jokes tried in this film. I watched and enjoyed parodies of great films, but unfortunately this will always be what I remember best - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason anyone should want to see this is if they want to go into a coma for a short period of time. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie ever.
