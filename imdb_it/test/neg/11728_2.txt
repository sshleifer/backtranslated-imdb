Totally forgettable film, but an incredible soundtrack: I would give (soundtrack) a 9 out of 10. I have the CD and the guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is superb! I saw the movie years ago and I had to check IMDb to remember what it was. I'm obsessed with getting the soundtrack and I've had to replace it since. Ranging from blues / soul / ballad to a dose of gospel. All the songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren who is Steve Van Zandt's other main guitarist in the E Street Band. This guy can play! The voices are handled by Nils (he doesn't sing very well, too hoarse), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
