The film opens with a scene that simply could not be. A man wakes up and while his wife stays in bed, he starts morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. The morning blessings are recited, but only those that Gitai finds controversial. the rest is conveniently omitted. then while in the Philistines and in the high he kisses his wife good morning !! This is not an accurate representation of Jewish prayer in any house, not to mention a Hasidic house. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying Hasidic life. He is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his Jewish marriage was laughable because it does not even come close to the atmosphere of a Hasidic marriage. I have many problems with the Hasidic lifestyle, but I have no use for Amos Gittai's comment on these issues. It would make you think that the Hasidim are all dense comformists with serious attacks of depression. I may not agree with the Hasidic lifestyle, but I recognize that Hasidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his pseudo-intellectual secularist obstinacy and is therefore unable to portray an accurate painting of Hasidic life. Apart from his scanty research and the unbalanced portrait of Hasidic life, Gitai also fails in other aspects. The plot is full of holes, the dialogue full of silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and the acting, while sometimes powerful, was too often charged with melodrama. The film drags on and on and the ending is not worth stopping. see if you should, but be warned. If you want to learn about Hasidic life, go to the communities and talk to Hasidim. Don't rely on Gittai's movie!
