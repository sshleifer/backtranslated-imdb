"Kicked in the Head" is all about the character of Corrigan, about twenty men searching for himself and his entanglements with a handful of bizarre characters. This subtle and ambiguous story, which was written by Corrigan, has a make-up-you-go touch and a script that smells like an uninspired low budget indie. Despite this and some annoying interjections in the Hindenburg scene, the film has an enchanted, bizarre fascination that can, in some way, attract people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for some. (D +)
