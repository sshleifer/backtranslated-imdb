I took this movie as one buys a deal on troma.com with The Ruining (which is not much better). The main reason I wanted to see Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods, the DVD is a dual function of that movie. I didn't really know what Actium Maximus was and when I saw the trailer I got scared. It looked terrible. But hey, what can you say from the trailer? Well, apparently I could say a lot. This film honestly didn't make any sense to me. The special effects were so terrible that you can't tell what's happening in the name of God. I understand that Mark HIcks had an extremely low budget, but come on. And it's sad, because in the interview it looked like it was an epic movie and meant more than you could see. But unfortunately, watching the film is one of the most boring hours and 15 minutes of anyone's life. It is so painful to sit. I just can't explain the plot because I didn't understand it at all and I saw this movie twice sadly! Apparently they used some kind of puppets for "alien dinosaurs" like they did in Star Wars. But these special effects are terrible, I can't stress them enough. And most of the time the bad special effects are fine, but this movie needed them badly. It takes place on a futuristic planet where alien dinosaurs fight each other and bad actors in hooded sweatshirts run around, and they look like they're in the kkk. And a box with a blue light on it is the president. I know in the interview, Mark Hicks said something about how to make this a television pilot, well, I can understand why this didn't happen to CBS or NBC. There are two positive things about this film. 1. the music is actually pretty good, it has an epic score that stays with you for days. E 2. The introduction of Lloyd Kaufman is always hilarious. Overall, don't waste time, but check out Star Worms II: Attack of the Pleasure Pods!
