A friend warned me that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. I was curious, because he had developed a cult status a little. I like a lot of weird cult indie movies, so I gave it a shot. I have to agree with my friend. It's a steaming pile of dung. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but I can recommend you much better things if you want to watch an indie cult movie. Try Dead Alive by Peter Jackson (aka Braindead), Cemetery Man (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or Modern vampires.
