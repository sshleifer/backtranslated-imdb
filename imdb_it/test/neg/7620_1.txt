Do you know what peasants spray on the fields? Exactly - Manure, so when the BBC decided to make a GMO conspiracy thriller and cultivate what we got it was one of the most stinky crap the BBC has inflicted on its audience <br /> <br /> !!! ! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> FIELDS OF GOLD opens with a group of masked scientists in a laboratory where a scientist (According to the right on the fashionable BBC all scientists are women) announces "A new strain of wheat that will save the third world from hunger ", so the story goes to another equally bland scene. If you're going to create a thriller of any kind, shouldn't you open with a hook that grabs the audience? DOCTOR WHO He was brilliant in this as he was X-FILES while 28 DAYS LATER opened with a hook that took place in a laboratory. I imagine someone on the BBC didn't think this thriller needed a hook because the viewers had the trailers stuck in their throats for weeks in advance <br /> <br /> While the story (not very exciting) continues a couple of journalists ( One is a drunken man with a lower moral than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush put together while the other is a female journalist full of virtue) who investigates patients in a county hospital who could be chased away mercy". It is at this point that things start to get confused as the journalist is threatened by MI5 shots and the first episode ends with the main spy of MI5 being killed. <br /> <br /> The second episode reveals that the patients at the county hospital have actually been dying from the infection with a VRSA superbatter. This is when things go totally hay. In all GOLDEN FIELDS the public was led to believe that the intelligence services and company shown in the opening sequence were behind the deaths - but they are not. It turns out that the villain is an organic farmer who made the VRSA superbug in his bedroom and the story ends with the MATRIX camera working with the drunk male journalist who sets fire to a field ridden with VRSA, thus spreading the superbug all over the earth <br /> <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about FIELDS OF GOLD. At the time of his broadcast I was both a member of the Scottish Green Party and of Greenpeace. Since then I have given up my commitment to the environmental movement, but even now I feel a little offended by the way environmentalists are portrayed here and by having the wicked spreading a genetically modified fatal virus as a warning to the dangers of genetically modified organisms is very foolish. It's a bit like a member of the CND who detonates a nuclear weapon in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also a little offended by the way the male characters were written as bastards while all the females were very intelligent and morally superior to men. There are also other problems with the script, especially regarding VRSA. If, unlike the writers, you take the time and trouble to search for VRSA, you will find that it is completely different from what you see here. Oh, and if you fire the diesel it won't explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles the structure of the JEEPERS CREEPERS so the last ten minutes contradict most of what happened before. Where as JEEPERS CREEPERS lasted only about 90 minutes FIELDS OF GOLD lasted twice the length so it is doubly irritating and illogical <br /> <br /> As a footnote, environmentalism is never a good theme for a thriller (does anyone remember those Steven Segal films?) and the time has come for TV and film producers to understand it
