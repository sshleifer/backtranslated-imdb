I saw him at Inter in Toronto. Film Festival in September 2005. The description seemed intriguing - how wrong I was! This could easily be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see that the director is my age (born in 1948) and lived with Nico of the Velvet Underground, which takes us to Andy Warhol, which coincidentally is what I thought of while watching this movie: 24-hour movies of Warhol that never happened again. This is not art, this is boredom. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. OK, maybe ... but what's the purpose here? Surely they had color in 1968! And there is no conflict with the present. And yes, the subtitles were white, of course. I don't think I missed a lot, but that made 20% unreadable. <br /> <br /> So, it's a pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events. What is the purpose of the conversation with old man at the table? It does not add anything to the film. There were many similar scenes - almost as if someone had taken a video camera and filmed random people and joined them to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Plot? None. The "riot" consists of some figures in the distance that occasionally raise a rock off the screen. Mainly it's a harrowing time to watch people (in the distance!) Standing around. Repetitive opium smoking is equally boring. When the main character has a nice girl, I got up, but no, she was boring too! This is perhaps the only French film I saw where no one takes off their clothes. They were probably too bored to worry. <br /> <br /> Romance? None. The girl seems totally indifferent to everything - perhaps her sculpture has a certain interest, but if she does, we are not shown. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all unattractive. Perhaps this is the point of all this?
