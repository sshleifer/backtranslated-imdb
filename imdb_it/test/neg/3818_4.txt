Let me just give you guys some advice, if you go to see this movie just to see a bunch of unlikely characters being slaughtered in a dozen different ways, then you'll love this movie because everyone will die a horrible death, beyond blood there is much more. <br /> where I should start: - The characters do not attract the audience as there are no secondary stories for any of them, because I didn't feel connected to any of them, in fact I didn't like any of them them, and I was so fed up with them that at the end of the film I was cheering for the unfortunate disfigured person who killed them all (which he did about it) <br /> <br /> -bad acting; I mean, I didn't get it, take the Asian tour guide for example, before he spoke perfect English, then after their little tour boat sank somehow he got an accent from the blue, then he went to talk in normal english. <br /> <br /> - one of the worst endings for a horror movie: (if you can call it that) after the monster / mutant human kills almost everyone, he is killed by the last two idiots left, or so they thought! the monster / human creature is finally killed when the beauty and the misfit attack a stake through his heart / nick (it was difficult to say) and presumably died right in front of them (within arm's reach) but later returned and brought them back kills (wtf) I mean because he didn't kill them only when he was right next to them. Arghhhh! I mean it was just too late, it was as if the writer didn't know where he wanted the story to go (or he was minutes from 80 minutes, so he added some more retarded twists to the movie so people can get 80 minutes of shit instead of 75 minutes. <br /> <br /> what I didn't get was why they didn't just kill the damn thing while he was unconscious, instead they just walked away like idiots and left so could go back and kill them, the only reason I gave a 4 was because of the gore which was actually the only thing I watched this movie to the end, for that and to see them all killed., they are serious)
