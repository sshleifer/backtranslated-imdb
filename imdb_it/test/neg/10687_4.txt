If, like me, you actively look for the rarest and most bizarre (and often the most terrible) world cinema has to offer, then you shouldn't look beyond Hong Kong's supernatural horror production in the early 1980s. Often mixing the bizarre black magic with kung fu and the stupid comedy, and usually chock-full of crawling crawlies (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes etc.), these films are as bizarre as they are. <br /> <br /> Succubare is certainly a case in point: with a mountain tribe whose women prevent their men from diverting bad spells on them (which, if they were to leave, have them filled with twisted creatures and die a death painful), some like martial arts and a lot of killing of animals in real life (many of which are perpetrated by a geek who has absolutely no connection with history), this film is simply strange. <br /> <br /> A prolonged scene in which the tribes that hunt snakes and insects, casually throwing the creatures in the baskets on their backs, are quite fascinating; a tribal party that sees a poor ox banging on its head and then being torn to pieces is totally disgusting; and the moments when the worms crawl into open wounds and are vomited on the floor will have the freaks who lose their appetite for a while. <br /> <br /> However, it is the crunching of animals that truly qualifies Succubare for the legendary status among fans of extraordinary films. It is completely vile to look at and yet strangely compelling: the geek chews a snake, throws down a fat and juicy toad (unpleasant!) And greedily devours a mouse (biting its head and then pushing the rest later). /> <br /> It's not a great movie (hell, it's not even a mediocre movie), Succubare is only recommended for people who think they've seen it all. This takes me 4 out of 10, which is probably more than I deserve, but I grudgingly respect him for being able to make me feel slightly sick.
