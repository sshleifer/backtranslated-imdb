Solo begins as a team of US soldiers in Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong even though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians of which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) is not happy, at the base and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders from Solo to be closed and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self-preservation, so he decides to flee to the jungles of South America where Colonel Madden and his men are sent to recapture it ... <br /> <br /> This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba and one has to say that Solo is horrible. David Corley's screenplay was based on Robert Mason's novel 'Weapon' and is a clich√© after another, robots were popular at the time when Solo was made in Hollywood and at the box office so that the same robberies as Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator films in addition to having the same setting and the same basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish on an emotionless robot that increases the sense of humanity as it is around people, at first it doesn't know what a joke it is or why one person will take care of another, but eventually develops emotions and people start making friends, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The character is poor and in particular Colonel Madden has absolutely no motivation to hate For nothing at all and because he would kill other US soldiers and disobey orders to destroy him. You know I saw it on Cable Telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money) and I looked for it in the TV guide and you know what he said? My TV guide described Solo as "a terrible sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels" which, when I think about it, is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide hit the nail in the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action movie, it definitely plays Mario Van Peebles and it's definitely terrible. Enough said. <br /> <br /> The director Barba does nothing particularly special here and the action scenes lack real excitement and the elements of science fiction are practically non-existent apart from the fact that Solo is a robot. So the military loses Solo and Colonel Madden is sent to resume it right? I'm not funny, but wouldn't the military put a self-destruct mechanism inside Solo in case something like this happened? Surely he would at least have a tracking device inside so that the military would at least know where he was at a given time? I'm not funny, but these people can invent a traveling robotic talking soldier, but they're not smart enough to realize that a location or self-destruct device could be useful if something went wrong? The violence is mild, there are some OK fight scenes, but this is really weak stuff. <br /> <br /> Technically the film looks good and is done competently, in reality it was shot in Mexico. Action agent agent Dolph Lundgren, Red Agent (2000), modified Solo's filming in that movie. Acting is mediocre, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot ... William Sadler deserves better, just a few years earlier he was staring at the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). <br /> <br /> Solo is a really ugly science fiction movie, which is basically a huge rip-off of Hollywood science fiction action movies, like Robocop, Universal Soldier and the Terminator movies. I don't recommend and I will start paying more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing the movies to watch ...
