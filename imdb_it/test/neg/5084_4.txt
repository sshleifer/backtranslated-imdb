It may have been exciting for an audience in 1946, but now the film is a bit boring. I had a hard time putting up with the whole thing, and it was very predictable: I mean, we know from the beginning of the film that Welles is the Nazi war criminal, and I'll give you a hypothesis to know if he was caught and properly punished . <br /> <br /> Not worth watching. It's sad that Welles only made three noteworthy films in his long career: Kane, Ambersons and A Touch of Evil.
