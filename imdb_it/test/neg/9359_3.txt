I heard good things about "States of Grace" and I entered with an open mind. I thought "God's Army" was ok, and I thought maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a director. The film started with a shaky acting, and I thought, "well, maybe it will get better." Unfortunately, it never happened. The image begins with the introduction of two elders - the Mormon missionaries - and it seems that the public can get to know them and grow to take care of them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly unlikely series of unfortunate events that highlight the blatant disobedience of missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely at the level that portrays Dutcher) and becomes almost ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The only successful Dutcher in this film is his successful alienation of his target audience. Unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher does nothing but ensnare his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. The missions do not resemble what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission I can attest to this fact myself) and the gang life in California certainly contains a much more explicit language than the occasional slight vulgarity. <br /> <br /> The conclusion, that I assume it was supposed to touch the public and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to everyone, is both incredible (come on, the whole mission comes together to see this elder sent home - and mom and girl are standing next to each other!) and cheese. Next time, Dutcher, try to create a movie with which SOMEONE can identify.
