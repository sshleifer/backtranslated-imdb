I've never been a huge Almodovar fan, but in general, I've always found something to enjoy in his films. Unfortunately, I had more trouble finding something to enjoy in Broken Embraces, so normally I would think I'd do it. <br /> <br /> I find that the biggest failure in Broken Embraces are the characters and the lack of depth they show. The film is essentially a love story, tragic and that wants to involve the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our 'hero', the director / screenwriter, Mateo, is having sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent arrives while the woman goes away lazily. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our 'hero', the director / screenwriter, Mateo, has sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent enters and looks up, while the woman leaves timidly. Mateo stutters something about the need to enjoy life as the only thing he has left. After being blinded in a tragic car accident that also killed his "real" love Lena, played by Penelope Cruz, the viewer could comply with this notion, except the rest of the film actually never shows why Lena was love of his life or any depth to his character or any other. <br /> <br /> Cruz plays Lena the lover of an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the beginning, their union is rather pathetic, since Martel tightens jealousy to Lena, and Lena avoids the uncertainty of being alone by remaining with the much older Martel. To jump ahead, Martel finances a film for Mateo so he can keep an eye on the protagonist of the film, Lena. Naturally, without a backstage, Lena and Mateo fall in love. And, in the world of Almodovar, it's really that simple. Mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, then revealed that he has a son with his agent after their romance. His son answers this information with a laugh and an "Oh, good". Once again, no depth, no understanding for any of these characters, everything happens. From the beginning of the film until the end, I received no emotion from Mateo. It is flat and does not behave very differently from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The only scene that I enjoyed was when the film producer, Martel, is watching the video footage of his son recorded in the guise of making a Mateo documentary. There is a beautiful moment when Martel looks obsessively while a lip-reading confirms his worst fears. Later, Lena confronts Martel while he is watching the movie and utters his part aloud by matching the footage of his lips as he speaks. Some pretty brilliant moments. Pretty contrived, but still very charming. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for me, the rest of the film left me rather bored. I could not care about these characters or their situations, so no amount of intelligence on Almodovar's part can make up for this lack of depth. I think if you're a fan of his work you'll like this movie, but if you're like me, in between, then you'll find it lacking.
