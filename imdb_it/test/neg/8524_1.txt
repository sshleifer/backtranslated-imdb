I'm sorry, but I can't agree that it was a good movie. Yes, it's visually beautiful, but it's the story that drives the film and I have to say that the story was sucked in great. How in the world they managed to get some of those holes in the plot past the critics. A better story and I would have given a higher grade, but I was unable to do it and still be able to live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies and the previews have really deceived me. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why does the family that was killed remain to haunt the house? Why did the father come back again? First, why did you decide to kill? Why were children the only ones to see ghosts first? Many questions, not enough answers. If I could have given him a zero, I would have done it.
