I know that many people will have automatically assigned to this film a rating of 1, just because they don't have the huge budget and the top-of-the-line special effects they're used to. I, however, knew what I would get involved with when I put this in the VCR. <br /> <br /> I don't think we get a much lower budget than this, unless we're filming a family reunion. The lighting is horrible, the sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible and the acting is extremely negative by almost everyone involved. BUT, this is still a fun movie and the plot is quite interesting. He concentrates around a guy named Tom Russo (felt asbestos), who was lucky with his work. He is very protective of his wife and does not allow her to work, putting even more pressure on himself. As he begins to work longer hours, we see him slowly transcend into madness and obsession and it becomes suspicious that his wife betrays him and begins to brutally kill the various men (most of the repairers) he believes are responsible. <br /> <br /> I must say that the effects of the blood are extremely cheap, but they adapt to the general tone of the film .. The brutal ways in which Tom Russo devises to kill these men give us an idea of ​​mad he has become . The rhythm of the film is also very good and there is rarely a boring moment. The ending actually doesn't follow the rest of the film's plot, as it seems to want to move from a psycho-slasher movie to an aspiring "Dawn of the Dead", but it's still fun and I have to give Tim Credito Ritter to want to use a unconventional final. <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that I liked this movie, but it's not a good movie at all, if that makes sense. His budget is the main obstacle and the consequences are almost too much to overlook. I do NOT recommend it to people who are totally spoiled by big-budget films and cannot have an open mind to very low-budget films. You simply won't like it. For the others, and fans of the blood - I say I'll give it a shot. You will find at least SOMETHING redemption in it! <br /> <br /> My Grade: D
