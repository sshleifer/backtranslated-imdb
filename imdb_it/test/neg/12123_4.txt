Think of Jumanji but with a curse of death. A group of surfer kids gets their hands on a game that takes the life of someone who is playing it. Presumably it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish inquisition and carries an evil curse. <br /> <br /> Ok, unpretentious and just a sort of watchable story is nothing you have never seen before. Unfortunately, that was the story that struck all the right buttons in such a way as to have no real surprises. Far from the worst thing SyFy ever did, but certainly not the best. There are better choices out there, but if this is your only choice it won't hate it completely.
