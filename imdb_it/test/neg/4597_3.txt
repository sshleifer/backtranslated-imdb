After the phenomenal performance of Matt Dillon in CRASH, most probably will rush to get a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or simply got a lucky bounce from a fantastic script. <br /> <br /> Well, Factotum certainly has its moments, but the clarity of ... everything will most likely shift the spectators. However, nothing should be taken away from Dillon. His performance is wonderful and full of excellent impassive humor, showing that he is a solid actor with a remarkable talent; it's just a shame about the direction and the script. <br /> <br /> The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to conform to something that looks like normality. He quits or is fired from work in just a few minutes, only to find himself in a sad pub to meet even more disorderly women as he tries to write a nonconformist novel. We never really know what the novel is about except that it involves "everything" (cancer, film, you, me). <br /> <br /> Jumping from the workplace to the workplace and constantly returning to Jan (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a losing girl who is just as daunting as himself, Hank tries in vain to find out what his life is should have for him. If you ever learn what it is, it's an interpretation. Some might say that he will never do it, while others may object that his life is simply a path to darkness. <br /> <br /> Regardless, there is not much substance to Factotum even with the beautiful performance by Matt Dillon. The plot unfolds through Hank's life without much thinking about where to bring the public. And this is a sin. Dillon's performance would have shone even more if he had a decent script.
