Not only the effects and the acting in this film bite, but the story was terrible. <br /> <br /> A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore it ... build a shelter ... so, everyone is upset that he "is playing with God ". <br /> <br /> How lame! He built the thing, why does everyone "have the right" to access? Totally a lame story, don't waste time!
