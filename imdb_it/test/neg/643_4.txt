After watching this movie on TV, I searched on IMDB and to my surprise I guess a rating of 7.6! This is not a good movie. Assembly is particularly bad; the poor way in which history jumps from one point to another was amateurish and a huge distraction. It is not done very well. I agree that the acting was pretty decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the plot was quite intriguing.
