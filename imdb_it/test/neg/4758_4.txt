This bubbly romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but now I find it rather disgusting. In the case of the May-September attachments, undoubtedly what is in the mind of the old party is either lust, or the inability to deal with the reality of aging, or both. And the younger one is probably looking for the kind parent she (or he) missed as a child. These agendas now seem more pathetic than romantic to me; there is also something rather predatory about them. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell seemed a little embarrassed, as he should have, playing the old lover in this stupid story. He was, in his fifties, trying to play a thirty-eight-year-old man who was mocking a teenager. But the young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - pretty and impertinent and full of vinegar - like a rude seventeen year old presented as a sort of "gift" to the morally honest and honest writer, as a subject to be studied for him. His witty interpretation got me a better evaluation than what this film would otherwise deserve. Anne Francis was cast as the beautiful but fragile girlfriend of Powell, and handled her small role skillfully. <br /> <br /> Some dialogues have also been a lot of fun, so it's not a complete failure. <br /> <br /> 5/10
