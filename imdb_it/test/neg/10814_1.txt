The movie "The Cave" was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There was no plot, no plot and the light was terrible. For most of the film, I wasn't able to make sense of the scenario as evidenced by flashlights. Persistent "gray" spaces throughout the film were annoying. The only scene that really came out clearly was in the cave lit by what appeared to be a bad simulation of the conditions found in hell. All in all, the film was not really worth looking at. If the producers can't find something better, they should find another job. The underwater scenes were particularly horrible, being mostly made up of bubbles and flashlights, with the occasional look of the actors. In summary, a truly horrible film with bad lights, extraneous flashes everywhere.
