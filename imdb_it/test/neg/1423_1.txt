Jerry Lewis was marginally funny when he didn't write his material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he started writing and directing his films, that little talent he possessed was overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his films failed (and deservedly) in the American market (they earned money in France) Lewis always blamed everyone and everything except him; for example, he blamed the failure of this film that, according to Lewis, he was released on a double bill with the porn movie "Deep Throat". If someone had to complain about that situation, he should have been the producer of "Deep Throat". This is an absolutely idiotic "comedy" about the richest man in the world (Lewis) who is rejected for military service during World War II and decides to equip himself with a special "team" to go to Germany and capture Hitler himself. In addition to the many flaws in this film (the script is incredibly unpleasant, Lewis's "direction" is non-existent, the film looks like a cheap movie), Lewis apparently thought he was surrounded by non-talent, beyond the Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller were a good idea; he must have realized that they would be so bad, that they could make him look good. He was half-right; they are awkwardly awful, but they come out even worse than them. For a "comedy", the character of Lewis is dark, angry and intrusive; the way he accumulates abuse on his subordinates makes you wonder why they would ever follow a stupid bully like this on a dangerous mission like trying to catch Hitler. The fact that this film took all the money is staggering. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can't bring myself to see if it's true or not - and it must be avoided at all possible costs
