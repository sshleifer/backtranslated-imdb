Norris plays a Chicago cop who runs into a devil apprentice? who wants, well, creates Armegeddon. Eventually he kills the creature, getting this by throwing a solid 24-inch gold peak, not very sharp, about twenty feet, strong enough to penetrate the chest. Unlikely? So is the rest of the film. Much of it is made up of CN and its assistant who drives the machines and speaks nonsense. The Israeli (or Arab) child is apparently there to humanize the CN. OK. It doesn't work, it doesn't make sense, and the plot progresses, so-called, not a little. Furthermore, no policeman is ever invited out of the country to be interviewed by other policemen. It is ridiculous as a premise. The whole thing is ugly. Unfortunately, it's not so bad as to be pleasantly bad or campy. Simply ugly. But - you can see how Norris was trying to find his way to the successful Walker: Texas Ranger series.
