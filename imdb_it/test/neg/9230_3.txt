People call a "party line" from 976 to talk dirty to strangers, and perhaps meet for sexual contact. An unbalanced, somewhat incestuous sister and an occasional transvestite brother use the line to find people to kill, usually married men, but don't discriminate! Even a sixteen-year-old couple calls the line for fun, pretending to be older, of course. One of them works as a nanny for a married man who is hot for her (or anyone else). Meanwhile, a deputy policeman is borrowed from the murder when he is the first to discover one of the brothers' victims. He collaborated with an assistant to the district attorney. <br /> <br /> Nothing too special here. Richard Roundtree has little more than a cameo as police chief. One of the talkative sixteen-year-olds is played by an actress who also voiced the character of Peanuts Peppermint Patty! According to the IMDb, the other died quite young, only several years after this film: sad.
