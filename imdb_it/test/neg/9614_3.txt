Not even "minor" Hitch, but simply a bad movie. The cinematic equivalent of a dirty old man. Ugly in every way: script without fantasy, static point of view, putrid clothes, horrible hair, unlikely actors and a scene of rape and strangulation really free. The perverse sense of humor of the director is present, but it is not applied consistently; the film comes to life only in its cruelty. Women do particularly badly; 'Frenzy' could be used as proof that the director was a misogynist, although a better explanation for me is that perhaps starting with the TV series and 'Psycho'- which he described as a thrift exercise, an experiment to see if a television the crew could make a passable film: Alfred Hitchcock had practically abandoned the art and had established himself for the commerce. In "Frenzy" the great master seems to bow to the conventions, trying to keep up with the times and give the public what they believe they want: in the form of unpleasant nudity, winks and generic thrusts. I don't reproach an old man for his rest, but I don't want to remember him tired, lazy and nagging, time to see "Vertigo" again!
