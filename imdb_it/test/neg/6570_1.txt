When I first saw him 9 years ago, when I was 9, I thought it was smelly. I'm 18 and I still think you smell. I mean nothing without special effects or anything, it was boring and a bit anti-climatic. My cousin once watched and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how much better it should have been, but they kept cutting the budget. It would have been a great episode, but it was a terrible film.
