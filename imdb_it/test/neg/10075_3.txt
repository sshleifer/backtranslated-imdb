I couldn't wait to see this movie since Lost World came out. It didn't bother me that Lost World wasn't as intellectual as the original, and here, I was just hoping for a good monster movie. It was "Dinosaurs eating people". However, it was disappointing even at that level. <br /> <br /> To begin with, there were not enough people to eat, and while I will be hiding the number of people being eaten, it was not enough. Also, while there was no shortage of varieties in the dinosaur community, there were no "enough" dinosaurs. And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-have-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, have just created cameos and haven't done much considering how cool they are. <br /> <br /> (START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls. The figures I read put their body weight at around 15 pounds, while the film makes them seem closer to 300. Worse, they failed to eat anyone, or even splash them on rocks by dropping them from above. There was not even the end of the film, it was just, suddenly, credits. (END SPOILERS) I wonder if the edition I saw was missing 40 minutes of film. <br /> <br /> My only conclusion may be that they taught the Pterodactyls to sneak their long beaks into your $ 7 pockets. Go and rent the Carnosaur series; at least you will not be disappointed.
