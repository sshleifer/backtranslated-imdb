I liked the Takashi Miike movies I had seen so far, but I found this rather disappointing. I bought it, but I won't keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the DVD Adness, which has only two episodes. In the first, a killer kidnaps women, cuts the top of their skull to expose the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chins and plants a flower in the brain. You can tell from the DVD box. In the film, the top of the head is digitally blurred by static TV. If I had not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not have known what people were looking at until a young policeman produced a small body model. Strangely, there is also a flash frame ahead on the woman's head and is not censored. Other than that, I'm not sure what was going on. Some women receive phone calls and a sketchy animated character gets scared when that happens. Sometimes an animated character also appears on television screens. It is not clear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are discovered and their children have disappeared. Once again, a policeman produces a model of how corpses are, which is useful because the real body is again censored. There is also a natural birth in the film, but strangely even that child and the umbilical cord are censored! According to the DVD packaging, uncensored versions were not preserved when it was originally made. Maybe even if they were, if they knew they would be censored, maybe they didn't bother to show something ...? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> If I feel that the following episodes are better, maybe I will try them. As it is, I will not worry.
