The actors and actresses in this series are OK, but the scripts were absolutely horrible. This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how not to be a parent. The screenplays are so ugly, they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than this. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is becoming a parent, if you want to see what not to do with your children, this show is the perfect guide. I think the rubbish that this show feeds us is beyond words. <br /> <br /> Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong advantage in better and better scripts than those I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> If you think this is generational, my boyfriend even turned off a show of this because they thought it was horrible.
