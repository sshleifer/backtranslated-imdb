I didn't like this movie for so many reasons that I can't even say then. I thought it was badly done just for the whole plot. I mean those who believe they caught the chupacabra and went wild on a cruise ship. BORING!!! It was fine for a cripple straight to the video, but it's not worth spending money on it. I can't believe someone gave this movie a ten. But I guess there are people who like this movie. I gave this film a 2 instead of a 1 just because it was about the chupacabra and had the boy outside the lord of the rings. If you want to watch this movie, I'd stay at home and wait for it to arrive at the science fiction channel. DO NOT waste your money seeing this movie. Believe me.
