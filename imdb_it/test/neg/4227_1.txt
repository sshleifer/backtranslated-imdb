Although this film has a slow, dreamlike, almost mesmerizing rhythm and an interesting, though perhaps not entirely accurate, description of the criminal investigative practices and personnel of a French rural police, I find that, ultimately, it is impossible to recommend. I think this film is simply a piece of work to advance a person's - the director, it is assumed - disgusted by heterosexuality. Of course, human sexuality in all its forms can have their revolting moments, don't deny it! But choosing the bad uniformly at the expense of good, as this film always does, suggests a deformed sensitivity to work. In short, if you like to look at homo-eroticism masked by compassion and the depiction of heterosexual lovemaking and the female form in a horrible and degrading light, then this film is for you. I wasn't, and it wasn't.
