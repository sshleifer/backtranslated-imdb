It's beyond me because two million Danish people sit down each week to watch this terrible show. The dialogue is terrible and unrealistic. The characters are empty and simplistic. There is a hard man, a hard woman and a sensitive man. The authors actually say they modeled the characters after Greek mythology! Give me a break! All the characters are obviously brilliant cops. When I saw this show I wanted "District Hill Street" and "NYPD Blue". These are brilliant shows and "Rejseholdet" is a poor copy. This program is a symptom of the disease that Danish television is currently suffering.
