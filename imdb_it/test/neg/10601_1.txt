** Possible spoilers ** Three young people on the wrong side of the law have the opportunity to change lives and become useful members of society by becoming undercover cops in "The Mod Squad", a resurrection of the successful television series on ?? 60, directed by Scott Silver. Given their non-stellar origins, and because of who they are and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go to places that other cops can't, so they are exploited by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to infiltrate a squalid night spot suspected of being a front for a prostitution ring. To begin with, Julie gets a job there as a waitress, while Pete and Linc simply "hang out" to find out what they can. Julie quickly becomes reactive with an old boyfriend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved with drugs, which are linked to the shady deals that come down to the bar. Before it is over, the "team" is engaged up to the neck, while it is in the midst of a bunch of wrong cops who are also involved with drugs, and consequently tied to their investigation. From the beginning of the film, there is the feeling that you are late; as if it were assumed that you know what is happening until the origin and functioning of the team. All that is obtained here is a short bios of the three gun shots that give you nothing but a look into their past; there is nothing about how this actually happened. Probably the thought was that, by doing so, he would have brought the story faster, making things go on. While this is true to a certain extent, some added backgrounds would have made the storyline a little more interesting; the way it was done here simply depreciates the credibility of the whole procedure. The plot is marginal to begin with, and any time spent on character development would have been worth it. What is delivered, and somewhat unimaginable, is a less than compelling story, full of one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfying, but the actors do not receive any help from the script, nor apparently from Silver; Danes, Ribisi and Epps are approaching to enrich Julie, Pete and Linc, but given the time allotted to them, combined with the lack of support, they still do not give life to these people. Farina, a good actor who deserves better than he gets here, looks like nothing more than a caricature of the "good cop". There is a feeling that this film has been given everything once; some details and nuances would have pushed the stock considerably on this. The supporting cast includes Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It is a pity to see the acting talent involved here wasted in this way; much more thought and planning should have been devoted to making this film. As it stands, it appears ill-conceived and poorly executed. Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like Major Leaguers who stopped playing for all the local sandlot marbles; instead of getting a shot at the title, they were all hung to dry. As Terry says in "On The Waterfront", "You were my brother, Charlie, you should have been looking for me." Well, it's obvious that there was no Charlie to look for here, and after "The Mod Squad", everyone can simply hope for something better to do next time. I consider this 1/10.
