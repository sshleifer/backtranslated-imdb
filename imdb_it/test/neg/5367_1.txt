There really are no redemption factors for this show. To put it simply, it's simply terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's just a terrible "reality" show. Not only that, it's a terrible fiction. <br /> <br /> Imagine this: a group of overly imaginative teenagers meet one evening and participate "Hey! Let's do a paranormal show like" Ghost hunters "and whatever!" So they take a camera, harass the locals and film random landscapes behind a painfully monologue "trying to be dramatic-yet failing-miserable". This show is basically a group of teenagers running around with a camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary. The only difference is that this show actually has a budget and writers. A wasted budget and terrible writers. <br /> <br /> Oh, the problems, how do I count? Well, first, let's talk about this on a personal level. I'm not a total skeptic when we talk about the paranormal. I am willing to believe in what is paranormal and what is not, and I am sure there are many people who feel the same way. So if you are going to do a paranormal show, you have to do a good job convincing the viewer that what they see is paranormal or not, because the viewer can easily believe otherwise. I hate to compare, but I don't see why not at this point. Take "Ghost Hunters" for example. In "Ghost Hunters" you can say that the cast is leveled with the audience. They are not totally skeptical, yet they are still willing to keep in mind the possibility of any paranormal abnormalities. They have to look at something and be willing to say "this is simply nothing." And with that in mind, they decided to try to make a mistake. They use technology and many other gadgets along with a constant moderation to determine what is paranormal and the fact that what could be monitored could be nothing in mind. Not only are they trying to convince themselves of what is real and what is not, in the process they are trying to convince you. This element of doubt is not present in "paranormal state". Strike one. <br /> <br /> In "Paranormal State", the cast simply says "there's this spooky place, and its HAUSED, so we'll find some SPIRITS!" And you immediately know and tell yourself "Ok, convince me otherwise". The cast is not professional in their interviews. In fact, sometimes it seems that they are simply harassing the local inhabitants of these so-called "infested" areas. They have no real evidence to support their claims besides hypotheses and theories, and the best they can do is someone who "claims" to be able to contact the dead, without anyone supporting who this person is and how valid they are. They could easily have picked a random person from the street and said "pretend you can contact the spirits for our show" and I went there. In the "Mothman" episode, this just happens. Without any convincing evidence towards the end of the show, they take this type of individual out of where he makes a random, painfully written "reading" of an alleged area of ​​how something is "haunted" to convince his audience. Very, very little effort. I feel that one of the main problems of the show is that it seems written. During one of the episodes, the cast is attacked by one of these "paranormal anomalies" sometimes in an attempt to be dramatic. These sorts of dramatic sequences would make all the skeptics laugh and even those on the fence realize that what they're looking at is just a bunch of tabloid junk. If the purpose of the event was to try to convince the public that these "paranormal" events are real, they are doing a horribly poor job in doing so. Strike two. <br /> <br /> However, there is always the counter. Just one last point of view to see if the show is really worth something. What if the show is not trying to convince you that these paranormal events are real and are simply trying to entertain you with good fiction? He even fails at that level. If the creators of the show were trying to create fiction to entertain the audience, the writing is too poor and even at the level of fantasy, it fails to convince the public that the cast members are really experiencing the unknown in all its glorious and full glory. Writing is simply not compelling and even, I dare say, boring. Strike three. <br /> <br /> So what remains of this show is simply a group of teenagers who are too willing or too credulous to believe in the paranormal simply because it is simply much more surprising than the reality that staged a camera, a bad script and bad actors generally just make a bad horror documentary. This is all the show is at this point. There is no reason to see it, not even for the entertainment factor, and there is no reason to worry about it. To be blunt, he is lame. There are absolutely no redeeming factors for this show.
