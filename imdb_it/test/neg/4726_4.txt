This is another well-known Mexican horror film: however, while the original version in Spanish is quite docile, all types of gurus and nudity have been included for the dubbed variant in English (prepared by Jerald Intrator - which has done similar tasks on THE CURIOUS DR HUMPP [1967/71] - and, like the American version of that film, had previously been available on DVD through Something Weird / Image! <br /> <br /> I looked at the original first and, although there were no big jolts, it was quite engaging, especially with a familiar plot like this: a doctor goes beyond the call of duty in an attempt to save the life of his terminally ill son, he also has a backbreaking assistant, with his legs crossed (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, who had played a surprisingly similar role - albeit in a more sinister vein - in THE CURSE OF THE CRYING WOMAN [1961].) I know that many Mexican films mixed the horror to the genre "Lucha Libre" (Wrestling) but I had never seen one; this element is present here - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but the two styles are, perhaps fortunately, kept separate (the wrestling sequences were done competently, with some of the moves being very funny). <br /> <br /> The doctor's son turns into a monster (which looks like The Incredible Hulk with mud splashed on his face!) after a monkey's heart was transplanted - but then when this is replaced with that of a comatose female wrestler, it remains like this and makes a pair of tusks grow (it shouldn't have been turned into a transsexual ... although I imagine it wouldn't have been very interesting) !! The climatic sequence on the roof in which the monster abducts a child and meets his death at the hands of the police recalls the GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942). My involuntarily funny moments preferred in the film, however, occur when the doctor, trying to comfort his son, tells him that he will soon recover - only to turn his back shortly afterwards on the point of bursting into tears - and even the impatient appearance gives his lame assistant (while the latter slowly approaches the car) when they are about to chase the monster that escaped from the lab. <br /> <br /> Alternate nude scenes work for the film (these were actually done by Cardona himself for a more racial Mexican version called HORROR Y SEXO), but his reputation is largely based on added material showing over-the-top violence, such as an eyeball pulled out of its grip, a scalping and even a person's head is torn off. There are also several graphic inserts that, however, give rise to one thing: while it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands that constantly hold an oxygen mask on the patient's face! <br /> <br /> It is also said that the film is a remake of the black and white horror film by Cardona DOCTOR OF DOOM (1962) but, since I didn't see it, I can't say how much it actually was stolen for NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES ...
