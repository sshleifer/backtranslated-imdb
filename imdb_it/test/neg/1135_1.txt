This film was terrible. He was too focused on Eddie, Clark Griswald's brother-in-law. Eddie works much better when he changes the good jokes like "Christmas holidays" and "Holidays". <br /> <br /> I really don't understand how a movie like this can be given a thumbs up. Now, don't get me wrong, I like Randy Quaid, but I heard that this movie was totally wrong for him and for the character in general. This film leaves a lot to be desired and really needed bigger name actors.
