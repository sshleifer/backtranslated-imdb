Beloved fairy tale of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" the dog) which is many different things for many different people. On his intense day "Benji" has breakfast at the home of two young children, has a chat with a law officer, chases an old lady's cat and reminds an old coffee owner to start the day's special. It helps someone, it's fun for others, it's the companion to everything. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned villa he calls home. From here on we only know that "Benji" can save the day. <br /> <br /> Trace the routine from writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and tend to make the effects in slow motion. If the public has difficulty resisting the adorable little dog, children of all ages will surely love it. The cast would never have been anything but "Benji's" background. <br /> <br /> It's not what you'd call inspired, but fun for the family. Oscar nominee for the "Benji" theme, "I Feel Love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
