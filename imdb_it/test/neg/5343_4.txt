As a writing teacher, there are two endings that I never allow my students to use: "Then I woke up" and "Then I was hit by a truck". Now I will add: "Then I had a blow to the head". I feel it is absolutely unfair to use these tricks to cover up the lack of imagination. The whole issue of transmigration could have been handled with intelligence and skill, however, in this film, they could not or would not do it. I'm not saying it's totally useless, but it's so predictable in its progress, except for the stupid ending. There are even gangsters going to the police to get help from this guy. They should have done it immediately. It's just a forgettable borderline horror / sci-fi movie, with nothing new to offer.
