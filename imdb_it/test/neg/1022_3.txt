Formula film on the illegitimate son of a wealthy Chilean who is about to inherit a fortune and gets confused with the bad business and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks a lot like a TV movie, not exactly exciting. The only reason I was concerned about seeing him was because Valentina Vargas was in it. No real surprises here, although it's nice to see Vargas. Great Chilean landscapes on display but the part of Malcolm McDowell is very small and does not add much to the film. Michael Ironside plays a bad boy as usual, but this is not one of his most memorable parts. The chase scenes are a standard rate.
