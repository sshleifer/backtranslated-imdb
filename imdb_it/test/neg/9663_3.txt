I admit it - I was attracted to it by advertising - and I didn't stop to consider the sources. "one of the best indie exploit films of the year (1999)," shocking "and" a must ". <br /> <br /> Well, I wasted my money, but not everything went wrong in this movie. At least the gore is right, as are some of the most unique methods of murder seen in a long time. There is also a plot (kinda) and that is all. <br /> <br /> But for an exploitative film there is it's a surprising amount of content - but not exploitative. We want gay sex - like We have 3 inter-racial girls - Maybe. We have a Vietnamese psychotic prostitute - good back, oral sex (ok that startled me) and some female versions of Gene Simmons (I don't have this part.) We have an honest goodness, Capone - one of the best actors in this film - it's not a compliment, and in the end we have a government conspiracy launched in - I don't know - try to link revenge / killing theme of Jimmy boy to make the Vietnamese psyche sound healthy ??????? If nothing else this fi lm shows that Italians and Americans do not have a block on this type of film. Latinos can suck like everyone else. The compliments go to anyone involved in this achievement that has overcome him and made a career for himself.
