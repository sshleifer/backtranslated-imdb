A group of seven people fear they are the only survivors of an H-bomb bombing in a nearby world. Not only do they fear radiation, but also mutants on the side of the surrounding hill. One of the groups is already contaminated, but strangely it does not represent a real threat to others. Only surviving the rubbing of assorted personalities at close range is the secondary plot. Richard Denning plays the hero. Mike Connors is near the limit playing a tough guy. Lori Nelson is the girl destined to start populating a brave new world. Not one of the best of director Roger Corman. This is predictable science fiction in black and white.
