Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors. But this film was poorly written. First of all, during the hijacking scene, Irons sits too comfortably in his chair ... he seems to be reading something, and rather calmly! Did the director turn the actor between shots? Furthermore, the hijacking violence was a great disappointment. Slow-mo, flying bullets - how his wife and wife are killed is not so interesting and the tension is lost. His pain later lost another 10 minutes. Then he decided to "get revenge" and talked to all his journalist friends and industry ambassadors (he is a journalist for the economists' rag) and here, in reality they give him advice on where to find the bad guys! How do they know? But what really made me shoot the film halfway was when Irons found his way into a warehouse where the bad guys were hanging - BUT NOT THE BADDY THAT KILLED HIS WIFE - and threw them away anyway. so he's just a murderer. he leaves and, well ... I close it. I mean, I couldn't understand how his friends knew something, and I also thought it was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers. Instead, he is looking for their friends, I think, or anyone in the warehouses and leaving the automatic weapons around. The suspense was totally conventional and the dialogue was lame ("it's OK son, helping crying", he says to his son, Son says "no, that's not it" and the father says "You're right.") Irons takes on questionable roles - like that dragon movie he made. It was excellent in Brideshead Revisited, which is a completely different animal from this warm thriller.
