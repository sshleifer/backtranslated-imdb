It is very likely that he simply did not give the film a fair chance because it was so immediately unattractive to me (something similar happened with the Belleville Triplets), but I really had to understand it when I inserted the film and my partner room, an exchange student from Japan, immediately started laughing at the movie, saying it sounded stupid. Now, I don't agree that it's stupid, the animation is very simple but clearly very clever. It's like a classic animation with added levels that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time. <br /> <br /> But the subject is completely unattractive to me. He has an interesting message about greed and avarice, but he is wrapped in such a nasty package that it's not worth learning, especially since you already knew it. The sound effects while the man noisily swallows cherries and cherry pits, for example, are really repulsive. <br /> <br /> There was an intelligent animation scene as we continued to plunge infinitely into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp, but it goes on like this for a long time that seems to obscure everything else. There is so much action in that sequence that it's almost like the whole movie was on it. <br /> <br /> As I said about Belleville Triplets, this would have been a great thing for a late-night TV program like adult swimming, or its Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar-nominated movie? It gives me the impression that there is generally not a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose from.
