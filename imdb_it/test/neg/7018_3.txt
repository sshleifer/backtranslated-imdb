Lucille Ball can't sing, act or dance. This makes the quality of his performance in MAME even more terrible. She is not allowed to do the slapstick of a low voice that made her a hit on TV, so she must rely on building a character. Unfortunately, Mrs. Ball has never learned that skill since none of the tender moments has any warmth. How do you really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never really believe the words he says. That vacant look from Ms. Ball will support her emulating us, but there's no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene in which it is found is flat. <br /> <br /> Also, when Mrs. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we are immediately made aware of why the studios have dubbed her voice for every other musical she starred in early in her career . It has been claimed that he asked to use his voice, so this is a mistake of ego and leadership. He got worse when he sang in voice-over and she must "act the moment" without words. Anyone who thought it would work forgot who was playing Mame. <br /> <br /> I understand that Rosalind Russell played the role on stage and in the movie AUNTIE MAME. Furthermore, I am aware that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for her performance in the original 1966 Broadway musical. None of these women were known for their singing voices, but both could have made it better than Lucille Ball. The reason they went with her is the worst in a blatant disagreement. <br /> <br /> The only person who comes out unscathed is Bea Arthur. It is big and wonderful, bad and common in all the right quantities. Unfortunately, you keep waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join in the fun. But the film never does and you can't. No one besides Bea Arthur seems to have fun. <br /> <br /> Another negative review goes to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as an award-winning director of theater and screen musicals and comedies, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of these skills and competences is helpful here. The poor quality of editing and narrative in this film is under a director of his caliber. This obvious mistake in the film's execution is not the fault of Ms. Ball.
