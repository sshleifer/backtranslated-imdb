This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a while. I'm about 40 and I've seen it with my son-in-law (20) and my son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched about an hour and turned it off. I spent more time on my iphone during the time we watched it than watch the movie. I gave a 3 because I liked the scenery and the cinematography; otherwise I would have given a 1. I'm sure there are people who are really "in the art" of everything that will find my terrible review but we all have a right to our opinions, right? I couldn't understand if this was to be a "chick flick" where the focus was on the mother, or if it was to be a kid movie, with an emphasis on battle and adventure. In my opinion, he failed.
