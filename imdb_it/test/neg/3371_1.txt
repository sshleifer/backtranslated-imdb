Well, let's start in a shrink's office, and apparently not very good at it. The main hero of the first Jack Frost is in the shrink office showing off nursery rhymes on Jack Frost. Damn, all right, my brother is screaming "Turn off!" Anyway, back to the lousy movie. <br /> <br /> The shrink has the microphone on and is allowing his secretary and friends to listen to this heroic sheriff. I suppose he should be the hero of the first movie, but he doesn't look like him! Yadda yadda yadda, they laugh at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people are digging the anti-frozen snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in a lab with some kind of doctors ... I don't see how this should do anything but the way they do the antifreeze / Evil killer mutant snowman with needles, heating, shocking, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, the whole nine meters. Anything. Well, give up and leave it in an aquarium. One of the doctors leaves his coffee on top of the tank. The caretaker enters, cleans the stuff, makes the tub jump and the coffee spills the tank that makes Jack alive. <br /> <br /> See the power of the moka! Now somehow he is in ... ah .. I believe in the Bahamas ... but it seemed more like Hawaii ... But it couldn't be Hawaii! Unless they spent all their budget on airline tickets. Bah .. I don't want to ruin the rest of this rotten movie, so you'll have to rent it and watch it from you ... Um ... I wouldn't suggest doing it but ... Sheesh ..
