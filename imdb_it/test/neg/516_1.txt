You have to see this film, it's a great note in the history of cinema. When this film was made, the American film industry reached the bottom of sucking. Watch this movie, laugh and feel sorry for yourself for wasting the last 2 hours of your life. It's the worst acting I've ever seen and even the worst direction. The bad guys laugh as if they were taken by a circus clown and if the guys who made "Scary Movie" want to make a parody on superhero movies they just have to take the script from this movie and do a remake, called Black Scorpion III: The threat of really bad movies that somehow manage to attract production companies in a suicidal sequel.
