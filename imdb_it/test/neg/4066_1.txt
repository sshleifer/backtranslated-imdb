You have to see this. I couldn't stop laughing at the nonsense I saw in this movie even after the event. There is perhaps a million individual errors and stupidities in this film. Acting is bad The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You won't like the movie, but you'll laugh and you'll have fun laughing after a long time. We had a great time AFTER the movie. Really. My friend and I spent a whole long 40 minute bus journey to chat about this movie as if we had seen the next Oscar. Unfortunately we were talking about all the bad things we had just seen.
