Well, I was hoping I felt bad about this movie because I'm a big fan of Ruggero Deodato and I really didn't want to see him slip; but unfortunately, this supernatural yellow-laden absurdity is as bad as I had been believing it would have been - and it's really terrible! The plot does not work at all, as the film attempts to merge murders and a supernatural theme through a telephone and everything seems very forced and foolish. Furthermore, the plot does not make much sense and one has to ask "what is the point" several times during the film. The plot focuses on a young woman who lives in an apartment building and is terrified by a telephone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the presence of the beautiful British actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately the beautiful points stop here. There are a handful of scenes of the dead, some of which are bloody; but all are incredibly stupid, what sees someone being killed by coins stands out above all else in this regard. Overall, I can't really recommend this to anyone; Deodato fans are unlikely to be unimpressed, and Deodato fans will probably find the movie depressing. To avoid!
