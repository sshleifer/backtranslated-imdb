I find the criticism of many users of IMDb a bit harsh and in many cases I think they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not that of the guy on the street who wants to sit and watch something just to get rid of everything. <br /> <br /> In this case, however, I must say that it was BAD. I am a SciFi addict and there was NOTHING in this film that grabbed me for even a second. <br /> <br /> There was no real plot. I could be an idiot but I still don't know where the GOVERNMENT was that was so worried about these pieces. <br /> <br /> The pathetic attempt of the protagonist to put together these 3 pieces is scary. For half the time the two pieces were ready and he simply had to add the third. A 3 year old would have been able to put them together. <br /> <br /> This film was BAD. <br /> <br /> Dominic
