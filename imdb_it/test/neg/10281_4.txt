First of all, I'm a big fan of Robert Blake, I always have been. <br /> <br /> This movie was released on Movieplex last night 10/13, and the title interested me and obviously the star. But after watching it, I was more confused than I was before it started ... There are some good scenes, and I thought they would take somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be an "anti-cop" "anti -buddy "" anti-hippie ", practically an" anti-whole movie ", with an extremely confusing plot that went nowhere. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake is great as a protagonist, very well as some might be with this bad movie, I'm still a big fan of Mr. Blake and I love his acting even in a shit like this ... But this drug induced the tripe of the 70s, well ... better to stay away from this ... And, in the end, what a pea.
