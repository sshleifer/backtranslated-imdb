I'm pretty sure Poe would have considered it a parody. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What was Fellini thinking? It is a wandering piece, casual, boring, with little to recommend it. One should feel frustrated by the lack of background or conclusion, but there is only relief that it is over.
