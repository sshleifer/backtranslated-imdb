Assault on Precinct 13 is the stupidest film I've ever seen after Charlie's Angels 2. The shame is that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know they said that this film is a descendant remake of Rio Bravo but did the authors of this film really see Rio Bravo? In addition to the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder for being freed by his brother and his gang. No one wants to free anyone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want EVERYONE to be dead. So, my first question should be, WHY NOT ONLY BURTONI THEIR ENTRANCE DOWN FROM THE BEGINNING? Why "attack" the place? I know the invented plot turn had to be clever and shocking, but it made no sense and / or was presented correctly. If the veteran policeman was involved from the start, why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran policeman suddenly made a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he get the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door, they would shoot him and have their entry point. It's all just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> Which part of a city can have a war out of everything in a police district (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but nobody notices? However, as soon as there is a fire they must "leave before the fire brigade shows up" ?????? How were they going to cover up the chaos that was happening outside? Did the police emit bullets in the walls, shell casings, fingerprints, use of equipment and the fact that there would be no "bishop's men" bodies to find? What about those police snipers? How could they ever miss so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to escape, the snipers were foiled by two small piles of snow. As if it were not possible to fire a high-powered rifle through a snowdrift. <br /> <br /> The set up was interesting even if ridiculous, but the film just exploded when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet in the head for absolutely NO REASON. I know the film's creators were about to shock, but all they got was disgust for the cruelty and anger of the audience. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and relatives to stay away from this? That particular scene must be an important part of that word of mouth (that is the fact that every storyline is more stupid than dirty). The conclusion remains constantly stupid while the villain stops to deliver a diatribe similar to Austin Powers instead of killing the defenseless people he has finally captured. I know several people mentioned the final scenes taking place in the woods of the city of Detroit (> snicker <), but why did the character of Ethan simply go into the woods in the first place? Don't you even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend leave? They just cut it to him that he walks slowly in the woods, with the gun in his hand. Gack. I could go on but I won't. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
