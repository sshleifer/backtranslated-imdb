I love documentaries. They are among my favorite genres of movies. Before seeing this movie I had not seen one that I didn't like. <br /> <br /> The premise for this film is fantastic. The execution is well done. There were a few times in advance when I laughed and smiled. And yet, as the film went on, it became increasingly boring and irritating. This could have been something special if the subject had not been an inarticulate, childish, inept putz. I appreciate his passion for cinema, but leave your whining. If you are short of funds, maybe you shouldn't have so many children, or spend so much money on alcohol. Maybe you should have gone to film school, or at least graduated from high school. Perhaps you should have lived life and gained perspectives and experiences that could add to your vision. <br /> <br /> There are so many people out there with interesting, funny and moving stories. Seeing this boy chosen on any one of them is none other than gross. If you want to make a documentary about a director, why not do it with someone from China or Iran, a director with real problems? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: <br /> <br /> Who takes a child to see Apocalypse Now? <br /> <br /> How many times has this man said "man"?
