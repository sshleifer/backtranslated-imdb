Why bother seeing this movie? Probably evaluate a prize for being the worst move in a great movie star's career since Clark Gable talked about an Irish patriot in Parnell. <br /> <br /> It is inconceivable that Bergman chooses both this film and his lucrative Hollywood career director in which he could choose between the best screenplays and directors that were offered at that time. To begin with, there wasn't a script to work with except a few notes. So we should believe Bergman as a poor refugee willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marrying a poor Italian fisherman who doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, it made more sense than to throw the bright Bergman into such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her manager, common sense flew out the window. <br /> <br /> So you go to live in this poor village where men have to work hard to extract a meager living from the sea. A place that she obviously hates to be and where it doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> His only friend is the village priest who knows he is not suited to the life of a poor fisherman's wife, but tells her that out of love, he must repress his true feelings of repulsion and accept the poverty and despair that he encounters every day. In addition to all this, there is this volcano always on the verge of explosion and drowning all in boiling lava. But as a true heroine, Bergman rebels against his misery by declaring war on almost everyone else in this sad film. He even tries to seduce the village priest, in a scene that would generate laughter if he wasn't so pathetic. Since her poor husband husband has to lock her in a room to keep her from escaping, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her away from the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; no man is unapproachable if he is willing to help her escape from the island and its misery. I won't bother to tell you how this all ends. The end of the film without a screenplay is as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (from seeing him on TV late at night) that he had two different endings! So be warned if you should feel brave enough to sit through this king-size turkey and capture the Bergman mix. She led to her fall in Hollywood for the next seven years and was convicted of sleeping with her director while she was still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films he made with this director (whom he later married) are noteworthy except as proof of a mad career. I'm not kidding. It's rather embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
