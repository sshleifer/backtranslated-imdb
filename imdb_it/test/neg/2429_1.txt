It pains me to see a fantastic movie turn into a bad, repetitive and lazy series. It is full of holes in the plot and the plot is confusing, in a BAD way. Anyone who had been the mad writer who decided to turn such a big movie into this junk should have done some research, instead of filling it with new jokes and characters, and the classic lines of the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. Of course they become a bit creative, but it's like seeing the same episode with a small twist. It's like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco has to avoid failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go in an easy way to save time and use a potion, someone questions the monkey and the insect, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with Malina, she He dissects it without looking like a bitch, Yzma disguises himself as "Principal Amzy" and calls Kronk, and forgets that he is Yzma. I admit, this show has its moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha seems ... strange. Also, nobody can replace David Spade and John Goodman! They those who created Kuzco and Pacha Kuzco and Pacha! Sorry, but I give this show two inches less.
