To really have the right to make a film so horrible! Actually, I'm more embarrassed than sitting around for the whole thing. It looks like an old science fiction movie from the 80s with a lot of super-happy "special effects", bizarre images and very rough dialogues. Maybe that's how they wanted him to look, maybe they think it's nice to make films in the 80s as if they were back in fashion. Who knows ... <br /> <br /> If you think the promise of the eye will save the film, you will be disappointed - the so-called "girls" are manish and definitely ugly. They can't act at all, I don't understand why they couldn't at least have nice looking chicks if they want girls without talent! But I guess when you're making such a stupid movie, you don't get very good choices, the hot chicks are just not lining up to make this kind of pitiful shit!
