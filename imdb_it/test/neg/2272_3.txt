Oh my. Poor Jane must have done the old thing by rolling into the grave. Even taking into account poor production values ​​for time (1971) and format (a sort of mini-series), this is baaaaaad. Whatever else you do with Austen, dialogue should shine (even in this, perhaps its most serious work), and melodrama should be strictly outside the limits. Alas, this is not the case with this production. When you get to Anne "Frederick, Frederick, Frederick", you'll laugh or cry. Unless you simply want to "collect" visually all of Austen's existing films, you can skip this. If you look at it, however, there are small consolations: the actresses who play Anne's sisters do a wonderful job with their roles.
