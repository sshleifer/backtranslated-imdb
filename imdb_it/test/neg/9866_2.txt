Drifting on bootlegs, sometimes thought of as an urban comic strip legend, the first FF movie is as bad as everyone fears. I imagine that Marvel Comics now claims that it does not exist, something with the 2005 version in theaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of bad-budget, low-budget Marvel superhero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). 'Low budget' is too easy a description for this FF image. Due to the lack of funds, the super quartet's powers were limited to very fast hits (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch) and fades (Invisible Girl, the easiest to do). The dress of the Thing was not bad and probably half the budget; the part of the face was particularly convincing. The acting? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are OK, although Jay, like Johnny, sometimes behaves like a spacer to show off his "fiery" temperament. Dialogue is a style of comics, and it is the supporting cast that ends up making it difficult to make it work. Dr.Doom is too melodramatic and unintentionally comic, and his two main henchmen are a case study on how not to act or write a dialogue. <br /> <br /> The plot? Not very well. It was quite faithful to the FF's history of origin (rather than to the next version of the budget), and although the non-budget, once again, showed narrow, for example, the actual emergency landing, kept the essential ingredients of how they discovered their powers in an isolated area - it's the best part of the photo, so you have to wait a full half hour. I also found strange music in some places; when the 4 are immersed in those cosmic rays, we feel a sort of church choir, as if it were a religious experience. The rest, however, is hopeless. Even without a budget, the story could have been done without the character of Jeweler (which resembles the villain of the Mole Man of books); he spends too much time with him and his underground band, as does the blind Alicia. These sections are a waste of celluloid and very boring. The climate struggle with Doom and his men starts well, but degenerates into a terrible mess while the Torch runs a laser beam (cold animation but belonging to a cartoon). Fans can laugh at the bad FF FX and the spiritless plot if they don't get depressed and indignant first.
