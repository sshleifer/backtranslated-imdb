Yes, absolutely terrible, and this comes from someone who loves bad movies - but there is a limit. I like all kinds of horror / suspense films and I've seen some wonderful works by European directors. Unfortunately, Broceliande is not among those wonderful cinematographic works. Camera work is worse than amateur. It is not the type of MTV "cameraman needs and fashion" camera that many cameramen use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply a bad frame composition and a terrible image composition. Acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stylized and unnatural, even more than the usual horror / suspense film that overrides pseudo-mysticism. I think what discouraged me most were the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ridiculous. I've seen what a limited budget can do and can do miracles. This was just a bad movie. Very very sad.
