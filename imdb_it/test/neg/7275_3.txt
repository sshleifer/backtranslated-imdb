Flipping through the TV and seeing that The Secret Life of was on; gave George Duran a chance to be the guest. I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as good as him, but George was very boring. He didn't really seem to want to host; his off-screen voices were monotonous, they didn't let themselves be involved by guests. He seemed to be interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he just found himself in the scene. I don't know if George is going to "improve" the hosting of this show, I doubt it because he hosted his show now. The show seemed to contain more information, but only because we saw fewer hosts. The formula of this show was very delicate and I fear that it has been definitively interrupted.
