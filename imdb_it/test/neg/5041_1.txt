there is only one way to describe this film. <br /> <br /> so bad it's hilarious. <br /> <br /> acting is so bad that I laughed my ass all the time. The male protagonist of this film trying to use a gun is so ridiculous that you'd think it was trying to copy a toy action figure, I know it sounds ridiculous, but when you see it alone you can't help but accept. <Br /> <br /> the monster looks like a cgi trying to recreate the clay monsters found in Sinbad's old movies. <br /> <br /> in short this film is good only for one thing the films can get. <br /> <br /> If you want to look badly at the scripts and the badly interpreted special effects <br /> <br /> THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU
