I must say, when I saw this 6.5 movie on this site, I thought it was worth seeing. I was very disappointed. From almost the opening scene, it is obvious that the two alleged FBI agents are, in reality, the killers. Could they have made it more obvious? If this is the "twist" expected in this film, it's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, their talent is also not up to a reproachfully bad script. Pullman acts skilfully as a sociopathic killer ... and that's the problem. There is no passage from "I'm playing at the FBI!" to "I just killed 12 people and boy, I'm tired of my arms". You can't blame the actors ... the story fails in many more ways. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film, however, I was sure I had made a mistake, that no director / writer would ever be so obviously obvious about a "twist" plot. Ormond and Pullman must behave in a strange way to divert the viewer's attention from the real killers, I thought ... which gave too much credit to the producers of the film. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the movie before it reached the 15-minute score. <br /> <br /> With the merit of Lynch, many things have come into play that make a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in the wrong configuration. We hope that Pell James will be able to recover from this role ... I found his performance particularly impressive, like the amazing drug addict, who turned out to be an aspiring savior. He would have to rewrite the role so that the "crap bitch" would win. <br /> <br /> Those who compared this film to Natural Born Killers, take note: Tarantino made the characters of Mickey Mouse and Mallory reprehensible, but understanding. The artistic ability of that film far outweighs the blood, and this is not seen once in Surveillance. Surveillance just wants it to be Natural Born Killers ... in fact, it has wet dreams of being even a fraction of what that movie was. People who haven't seen the surveillance ... stick to something with a little more intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
