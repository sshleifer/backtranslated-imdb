on this quagmire of mediocrity? You are much better than that. <br /> <br /> Simply put, Frostbite is worthless. Bad acting (and I use this term roughly), minimalist "plot", suffering humor and not brilliant snowboarding. There is not even a sufficient demonstration of female pulchritude to arouse the interest of socially inept but red-blooded males. <br /> <br /> Top Gun has had spectacular flight sequences to watch. Days of Thunder had a heart-pounding running action. Even Point Break had parachuting scenes to its credit. Frostbite has none of these. Not worth your time, my time, the time of Traci Lords, the time of Carmen Nicole, nor the time of anyone involved in this destruction of celluloid that would have been perfectly usable on something useful if it hadn't been wasted on this forage for the recycling center. <br /> <br /> The world will be a better place when we forget that Frostbite has ever existed.
