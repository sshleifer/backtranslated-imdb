Yes, my summary talks about everything. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, try it. But not for pleasure. For studies of one of the worst examples of trying to be politically correct, family oriented and "cool" at the same time. <br /> <br /> Men always think they know everything, they are stupid and the magnificent women are finally dissolved. Etc. This is particularly offensive, when all the characters are just as terrible and stereotyped. I mean, okay, "Cody" was fun at one time or another, but unlike other "stupid characters (tm)" like Woody in Cheers or Joey in Friends, he doesn't get good jokes. His stupidity is launched in a "dude" way, which becomes rather annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> The morale of the family is terrible. Everything for the family. The mother and father are supreme dictators, who in strict and antiquated parenting constantly say they "love" their children, and then, of course, in the end, children love them back * barf *. <br /> <br /> E: There is always a "tender point" like the one squeezed into "action", where the lessons of American morality (c) (tm) are imposed on the spectators, regarding sex (in a mature person, you can't have sex before you are 18 (!!), in a sense, or drugs. Even the customs of the church are described in detail here. The whole concept is directly disgusting, all done in an unconvinced way to make money. If there are people like Karen and Frank out there, please close them and disintegrate the key. <br /> <br /> So, with themes that go as far as disgusting religious propaganda, I think it's fair to conclude how I made my subject ...
