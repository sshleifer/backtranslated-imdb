Watching QUINTET is no different than watching a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese or another language you don't understand. You have the idea that they are playing, and if you look closely enough, you might start to understand the rules. But why worry, since it's clear that you can't participate and you wouldn't want to do it if you had the chance. <br /> <br /> Director Robert Altman is not one who asks the public to appreciate his films, not to mention them. Sometimes it lets you slip into the picture to be part of the crowd, like in M ​​* A * S * H, NASHVILLE and A WEDDING, films so full of confusion and orchestrated chaos, one or two other bodies in the scene wouldn't do much difference At other times, he seems to resent the fact that someone could even watch his film; as in IMAGES or THREE WOMEN, where the stories are almost personal monologues made for an audience of one, Altman. With QUINTET, Altman seems to intentionally challenge anyone to participate in the narrative. <br /> <br /> You can't depend on Altman to make logic or waiting, which is sometimes what makes his films so extraordinarily iconoclastic. But sometimes doing the unexpected isn't bold, just stupid. For example, in QUINTET, we are presented with a young woman who is apparently the last person in the world able to get pregnant, and is, in fact, with a child. This last ray of hope in a society in decline ends almost immediately; Altman does not even wait until the end to play his last depressing card in this elaborate nihilistic and pessimistic tale. It lets us know how empty and meaningless life is right. Courageous? Could be. Stupid? Definitely. Purposeless, try to build a story on a rapidly melting iceberg, all the while remembering how useless the effort is. <br /> <br /> For the record, QUINTET, can at least claim to be prophetic. The plot centers on a treacherous game played by various bored characters. It is a form of TAG (the game of murder): a handful of people target each other for elimination, each as a potential killer and each as a potential victim. Two or more can form alliances to kill a third. When they die, new targets are assigned. Whoever lives, wins. All this happens in some exotic and inhospitable desert. It is, to a large extent, an extreme sci-fi version of "Survivor" - without the traps and the distorted "reality". <br /> <br /> It's not a bad concept for an epic science fiction. A post-apocalyptic setting, a microcosm of the world (the cast is definitely multinational), a game where you can't trust no or at least not for long, and where nobody really wins. Literally a cold war. A director with steel eyes with a taste for dark humor and a violent invention could have a field day. The mystery of QUINTET is not in the game or how it is played, but in why everything exists. If the game "Quintetto" is a metaphor for life, then Altman seems to see nothing in the material, but the possibility of showing life to be an empty, meaningless game - a conclusion as obvious as it is false. Given the lively nature, though cynical of the rest of his various films, I don't think Altman even believes in QUINTET. And if Altman doesn't trust his material, why should we?
