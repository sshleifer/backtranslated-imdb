This film was one of the worst I've ever seen, it didn't leave out a single clich√© that could be imagined of a Hollywood Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator engaged in a special task: to find out if a suspected "snuff" movie is real. <br /> <br /> Certainly, he is involved in a deeper, deeper and stained pornoshops (managed by Mexicans) and sex cinemas are his field of investigation as he searches for the woman's killers in the movie "snuff". Assisted by a "smart" sex shop employee (he read a book), he is reaching a producer of murder slavery films and his perverted personalities who are responsible for the film ... ... and what do you expect? They are described as simple evil, without the need for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad guys and he is the purifier. Boom. Assassin assassin. End of the film Is it so bad? Yes, I'm afraid yes. <br /> <br /> Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert he killed) is pointing his ridiculous character: in the last scene, our hero forces the "machine" to postpone his leather mask (yes , of course he wears one) and recognizes that the "car" looks just like the normal man 08/15 from the road. So "machine" says: "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just like doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love killing people. Yes, of course, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that made this movie so boring, but it's also ugly. "I have to kill these people" - an attitude that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero tied one of the killers and tries to shoot him ... but he can't. So what does it do? He calls the mother of the murdered woman, says that her baby is killed and asks her if she loved her baby so much that she wants to see the killers dead. The mother cries yes, she will adore her son, she will return from the tied murderer and massacre him. <br /> <br /> To get to the point: this film is breathing the poisonous air of lynchmob supporters (certainly the police has no role in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography, does not take seriously the characters and waste your time with a stupid plot. Probably the only positive thing about this film is that it doesn't try pseudo-psychoanalysis ... even that would be too much plot. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this. <Br /> <br />
