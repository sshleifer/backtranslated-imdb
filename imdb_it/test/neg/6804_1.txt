I hadn't really heard too much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this film is only for someone who has not lived in the real world. And even those people would think that this movie moved too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the film opens, see Nicole Kidman going to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. That scene, the dialouge, was all fantastic. And then the movie went downhill. <br /> <br /> While respecting the vision that the filmmaker must have, this film sucked. It was too slow, predictable and not quite moving. Robert Downey Jr. is very good, as usual, but this film is not good enough to sit on. Try to be shocking and abnormal but make little use of the talents of all the actors. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money, even sex scenes were boring.
