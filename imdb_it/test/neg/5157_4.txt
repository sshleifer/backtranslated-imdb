Il Nido is actually just another "nature-proof" horror film that fails because of its tight budget. The acting is OK, and the setting is great, but somehow the whole film seemed a little boring to me. The gore effects aren't the best I've seen, but they're fun in a poor way. Cockroaches are just regular cockroaches that bite people. The Nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, then Slugs is a must see since it's ten times better. It is also worth noting that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another Deadly Eyes movie (also known as The Rats), which talks about killer mice as can be imagined. <br /> <br /> If you like these types of horror movies then you might want to give a watch, but you'd be much better at seeing Slugs which is much more interesting and bloody.
