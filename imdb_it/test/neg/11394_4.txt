The recent documentary "The Adventures of Errol Flynn" is an in-depth look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son carving his fiefdom for a sword, a thunder and a romantic analogy that ironically found if he had not been under contract with Warner Bros. would have been perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspect: the charming charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds the fact that he is a predator. And he could have acted with his best prominent sister, Joan Fontaine. That was Flynn's problem that was the last screen hero until his own habits and bad times were reached by him. Grant and Flynn are similar in a way but Flynn was the most macho of the two: you can see Grant as Captain Blood but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story Mr. Blanding Builds his Dream House, or Monkey Business, or Operation Petticoat would do it Ho turning those roles into their collective ears because it's too damn safe on their feet and the sexual tension it would naturally bring would make the lines of history falter. But this shaky biography is just a plastic vision of Flynn and his era. There are times when I almost expected a laugh or an audience to go "Ahhh" at some point. It doesn't go deep into Flynn's life just in viewing a magazine. He also does not go into his struggle to be considered more than a persecutor. Like the cleaned up biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not the Wolfman, or Lenny "Of Mice and Men) and Buster Keaton made in the 50s this is just a time that kills a piece of hair
