They should make the terrorists watch this video as torture, and not just for the disturbing final scene in which tying up and beating a mentally ill woman is apparently a comedy source. about half an hour of this would convince even the most convinced fundamentalists to overturn the beans rather than wait another minute for this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible. I rented it because a friend said it was fun, only to find out that he was talking about the corny director who made the comment rather than the movie itself. I imagine that if you find an unbridled fun arrogance, you'll like this. Apparently it is true that he goes on and on about the chicks is "slammed", the most insignificant example is when the leading actress arrives on the screen. <br /> <br /> Actually CJ Stacy was the only good part of this film - his charisma shines like a diamond in this horrible pile of manure. This is apparently the only film he made according to IMDb, I hope he is involved in theaters or indies, because I think he has talent and natural beauty to really be a resource for any production.
