I would have chosen both for this film. This movie was on my "to see" list for a while because people talked about "noise" and even the VHS box contains a lot of quotes from people who say how "amazing" or how "so close you can get to the massacre of the texas chainsaw "and such lines. But, sorry, I was disappointed big time. The idea is interesting, but the script is so underdeveloped that each character becomes an incorrect creation of evolution and people really make the most stupid films in the film. <br /> <br /> Which, in turn, takes away any credibility that the plot might have had otherwise. I could not believe how uselessly some sequences were "where he is, let's find him". Some sad moments to please the blood fan, but they are so few that when we get to them it doesn't make sense. If Luther is a nerd, then the directors really have to be down in the food chain.
