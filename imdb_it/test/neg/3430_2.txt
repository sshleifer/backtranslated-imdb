Besides John Krasinski, this film was absolutely terrible. The love story of Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan was more cliché possible, full of incredibly bad lines about how her parents would never allow them to be together and look like super hammy. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality whatsoever. The two accented characters (Dean Edwards in the role of Rupert and whoever was playing the weapons expert) .... after seeing how bad the accents were, they could not decide to leave them and rewrite a couple of lines to avoid giving pain head to the public? Apparently not. I don't even know where to start with editing, especially sound editing. If you hate overdubbing as obvious as I do, don't look at it. That being said, Krasinski was fantastic. Off the bat, I admit that I'm a big Office fan and that's why I rented it. But it's rather funny as "the friend outside the walls with crazy ideas". It has a cliché role, but still manages to make it as fun as possible. The ending was terrible. Simply terrible. The idea of ​​the theft gone wrong had potential, but Keegan struggling around after being hit, up to his studio to fall on a Chabert painting (which doesn't look like her) is the most cruel scene.
