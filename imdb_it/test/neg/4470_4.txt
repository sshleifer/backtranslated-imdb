Come on, let's put aside the suffering humor that we can find in racism and be honest ... it's not funny. I was astounded by the fact that the two main stars would have agreed to make a film so offensive and damaging to race relations, and I'm not referring to the obvious black and white commentary in the film, but to slams to other ethnic groups like Betty White's characterizations of Hispanics. We should simply call her to agree to make this film as a sign of senility ... is she too old to distinguish comedy from stereotypical garbage? Or is it the writers' fault? What about the third person of the makeup assistant ??? No, the fault is with us for having perpetuated this type of crap (in the role of comedy), that Hollywood will continue to feed us until we have the decency to say enough ... racism is real and it is not a thing to to laugh. We are all different, we celebrate this diversity, we don't make fun of ourselves and we promote division.
