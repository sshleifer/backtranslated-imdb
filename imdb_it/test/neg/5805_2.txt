A very ridiculous film. <br /> <br /> If Doris Roberts, Shirley Jones and Shirley Knight persist in this type of film, they can present their retirement documents and collect full-time social security. <br /> <br /> While the idea that a 35-year-old video game swinger loses his apartment and is forced to move in with his grandmother Roberts and borders Jones and Knight, this is foolishly addressed. Imagine that the 3 bags are filled with stuff that his nephew Alex left in their home and Jones who sleep with someone who could qualify as his nephew! <br /> <br /> Video game sequences are as silly as the rest of the film. The assortment of characters that Alex works with is incredible, as he enjoys his weed habit and the others. <br /> <br /> Terribly better describes this miserable film.
