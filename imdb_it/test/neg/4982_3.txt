Good things first of all: <br /> <br /> Underdog's vocal acting was FINE. But Jason Lee is fantastic, not a surprise. Even Peter Dinklage (Barsinister) did well for what he was given. He played the part in a shocking way. And also Patrick Warburton, the idiot assistant. Now, he was an idiotic character but he played very well, actually I liked the character better than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish but witty. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger has horrified and hopes he will never act again. His "Scream" was so disgustingly false. Silence. Silence. "Aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talking, an "oh no, impossible!" would have been enough instead of the pathetic fake cry. <br /> <br /> And then there was the girl and her female dog chasing the character of Patrick Cad on the roof. At the beginning this makes sense, she is a "Reporter". A school reporter, but in any case a curious mind. But why, WHY did HELL bring his dog with him? That was useless and that damn dog didn't even say anything other than a heartless "oh, loser!" His presence was extremely useless. <br /> <br /> Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I gave this movie to 3 is Barsinister, his assistance and the voice of a loser.
