No simply no. This is all that needs to be said. <br /> <br /> Summary: a random boy is in a cornfield. For some reason, I'm not sure, but it's his duty to run inside. The next big thriller? A five-year-old could make a better film simply by turning an anthill, or even just growing grass. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> It can't be said that he has bad acting, because there is NO acting. It cannot be said that he has bad writing, because he has NOT written. It cannot be said that he has a bad cinematography, because there is NO cinematography. You can't say it's a bad movie, BECAUSE THERE IS NO FILM! If you don't believe me, go watch it. Just don't say I never warned you .....
