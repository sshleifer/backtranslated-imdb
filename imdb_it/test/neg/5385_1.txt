I recently went to a free screening of soap girls where the directors were present. before the film they strut, laugh, take pictures. I was excited to see them dressed in real life, and I couldn't wait to see the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> during the film, the audience burst into laughter. it was clear to me then that they were not laughing with the photo, but on the photo. this is purely a B-level movie with no logic behind it. throw some nudity, some blood and whala! you have a movie! <br /> <br /> after the film I contacted a group of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this film. they acted seriously, as if they were serious directors. Each of them told me something different: making a controversial film, a funny film, an uplifting film, a socially responsible film. everyone mentioned something different. it was clear to me that none of the directors knew what kind of films they were making, and now they were trying to get their money back by advertising this movie in any way they could to get people to see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: do not buy in the advertising campaign! Unless you really have nothing else to do, it might be worth the time of a film student to study how a movie should not be made. otherwise you are better saving two hours of your life.
