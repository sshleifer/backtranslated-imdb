Too fractured to be fun, too loose to be interesting and too awkwardly photographed to be tolerable. MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by a really bad film. Like a Ken Russell film at worst, or DAY OF THE LOCUST redone by amateurs, MR LONELY may have seemed like a good idea on some pieces of paper (no screenplay, see) and a free vacation somewhere, but in Alla end we have a widescreen movie that seems made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I have the right director? MR LONELY is a waste of resources, trying to be (stupid!) Extravagant and deliberately out of mind. It ends up being annoying and indulgent .. and useless. What's the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this Hollywood illusion movie. Perhaps Korine wanted to redo GODSPELL ... well, the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh, there's some subplot like the remaining FITZCARRALDO footage including Werner Herzog, the nuns and a plane. Add melancholy and melancholy to the subdued and violin music, add James Fox who seems to hope it can be seen as bold (as in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen format. It would have been fun to shoot but the result on the screen is a disaster. Imagine the American Pie BAND CAMP with food poisoning.
