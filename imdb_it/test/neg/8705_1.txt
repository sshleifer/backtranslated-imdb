I appreciate the effort that the directors wanted to describe the story of Moses and the exodus of Israel, and that the film helps viewers put themselves in Moses 'shoes and understand the intense burden on Moses' shoulders. As enthusiastic about seeing this film, I was deeply disappointed with the plot. (I will leave out the videography, the special effects and the artistic ability in this review). What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how it is so far from the historical accounts of the biblical texts. One of the general principles of the Bible is that * God * led his people out of Egypt and promised he would take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. Not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in a column of clouds by day and a pillar of fire by night. He never left them; It was always visible to the Israelites. The film, however, depicts a God who remains silent during the entire wanderings in the desert. This film has changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead describes God as a silent, cruel and disciplinary silence. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the depiction of Moses was equally wrong. Moses was known as a man of faith (because otherwise he would have been a father figure for Israel through the Old and New Testaments, although Moses is known as a man of great faith). However, the film describes him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure solitary who despises the call that God has placed on his life. OK, I will allow some creative freedom for directors in the Exodus story ... but this is beyond creativity - it's a heresy.
