Down at the Movie Gallery, I saw a movie I had to see. It seemed like a fun low-cost horror / action / western where I could enter. Yes, I knew it would suck, but I still rented it hoping for laughter. Only a few laughs could be found. This was an extremely stupid film. Start with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is perhaps the weakest main character in the history of cinema. Watch / behave as if he could face Chuck Norris, but he can't. Even his dialogue sucks. Anyway, enter a village, shoot some zombies. You could say that they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where it takes 3-5 minutes to recharge or watch some zombies. At least the zombies look fantastic. However, some people shoot, some zombies die and in the end, everyone died except our main character, who should have died early when he was shot down by four people.
