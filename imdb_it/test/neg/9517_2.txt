I saw this movie without knowing much about it. The split-screen device was immediately irritating and things didn't improve after the title sequence was over. The plot, the characters and the dialogue were extremely stereotyped - the poor boy from the abusive family is thrown out of the house, wants to get out of his "bag", reinvents himself, changes his voice, dresses in the clothes of others, gets adopted by a gay man who continues to disgust as he rises to become part of an international drug series that takes British aristocrats. <br /> <br /> The estate of Patricia Highsmith (talented Mr Ripley) should sue the producers of this film. The triple screen for me, together with the duration of over 120 minutes, underlines the almost non-existent editing. You can't decide which image works and is the most powerful, why not show three and I hope you can get it right with one of them. This trick removed any connection or interest I had with any of the characters. Important dialogue was repeated 3 times on each screen, as if to say "this is an important / moving / profound moment, ok!". <br /> <br /> Don't waste time. <br /> <br />
