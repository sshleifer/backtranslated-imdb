I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I have to say that my expectations were very low before looking at Ocean's 12. I really liked the first film, but this successor is one of the worst films ever. I would rank it among the top 5 of the worst movie I've ever seen. Why do I say this? First of all there is a story so subtle that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned to the term "history" are kept together at times, but most of the time the film simply moves without purpose or unity. The whole story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced, which sometimes turns into a farce. <br /> <br /> Actors appear but do nothing to deserve credit or evaluation. The most embarrassing thing is the leading women (Roberts and Zeta-Jones) who overplay or are extremely simple. Damon, Clooney and Pitt are not brilliant either. To be honest, I really don't understand how they would like to be associated with something as bad as this movie. <br /> <br /> === May contains spoiler ==== Camera and editing, sigh where I should start. There are many unnecessary machine movements that make the experience painful. Combine this with extremely indifferent editing and start looking for a wooden spoon to carve out your heart. Especially the scene where the whole gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car. The zoom of the camera on each person becomes boring and when you are at the number 3 of 12 you have the message: wow you are strong and you can do simple zoom effects - NOT. I understand that the scene with Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts) who plays Julia Roberts should be fun, but it gets extremely embarrassing and you walk away to avoid experiencing chaos. Bruce Willis. Why? Please explain it to me! WHY ??? <br /> <br /> In summary ... if you have to choose between working on the root canal and watching Ocean's 12, I recommend the first one. Make sure they make all the teeth while you're there ...
