I must admit that, despite media promotion and Oscar nomination, my expectations from the film were not so high before looking at them. And I really found what I expected; a film that tries to be nice to both conservatives and liberals in Turkey, trying to be authentic for foreign viewers and fun enough for everyone. But it should be clear that it is not possible to be favorable for everyone, so the film remains average for everyone. <br /> <br /> The entire film tells a story that took place within 24 hours. To adapt the story to an entire movie, some scenes are added without a connection to the main story. These are above all the scenes of sale of ice creams to the eccentric locals (eg. Herdsmen of goats, old women etc.) And each of these sold scenes is tempted to be interesting for the spectators from scenes with comic dialogues. The argument is mentioned as a universal problem: the struggle of a local producer-trader against the holdings and the monopoly, but this was the interesting topic of twenty years before. Most readers will remember Ferhan Sensoy's "The grocer of heroes against the supermarket" in the 1980s. This was the right story at the right time. In short, the story is not strong enough and it is worth it to be a movie like now. <br /> <br /> Except for some stretches due to local accent, the cast's performance is so successful. The main role is played by Turan Ozdemir with an excessive body language, but it is still successful. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, against a limited budget, the director's and players' appreciable efforts are obviously giving the film a good mood. But this is not the result of a film good enough to be compared to Italian neo-realists or that deserves to be an Oscar candidate. <br /> <br /> Note: in real life, normally the ice cream seller would stop his production and be the dealer of one of the competitors of the Manda brand.
