Oh no, one of these Japanese ghost movie attacks ... I don't even remember how many I've seen. maybe sells ... but not me. it's not scary at all. Japanese horror films have been very similar since the first of these ... even the boy's shooting. I've seen it staged so many times in so many horror movies. the mobile scene is nothing new ... the drama of the boy who is hit by a train sucks ... I mean that all the drama was missing ... OK, this is for the boys 14-16 who listen to the Japanese rock and they think they're so unique ... I'll let you tell. there is a million of you = D this is one of them. 3/10 I've seen worse but you won't miss anything NOT seeing this!
