Lonesome Dove is my second favorite western only to The Searchers with John Wayne. I look at Lonesome Where about every 6 months and I never get tired. I read all the LD books, although I don't remember much about Comanche Moon. I also look forward to this mini-series and decided to register it on our DVR so that we could quickly go through the commercials. Unfortunately, I messed up and didn't record the first part, but I decided to look at the other parts and try to resume. <br /> <br /> There is no one who can ever compete with Robert Duvall or Tommy Lee Jones, and I expected to be disappointed and I was. <br /> <br /> Although there were so many things that didn't sound real, the most obvious thing for me was when Nellie died the day before and Gus was out of range, he switched to Clara by writing him a letter from Nebraska that she told him how sorry she was to hear of his death. How could he know the next day in Nebraska? Furthermore, it should have been 7 years later after his departure and his children seemed to be about 6-7 years old, maybe a little younger, yet some time passed before they moved to Lonesome Dove, and Lonesome Where they had there. I've been around 10 years or more before leaving for Montana. When they stopped at Clara in Nebraska, which probably took another 6 months on the trail, the girls seemed to be around 10-13, since they were playing in the yard like small children. Mathematics is not added. <br /> <br /> I agree that the man who played Gus had many of his ways and looked a little like how Gus looked like a young man. <br /> <br /> I'm also a little confused about one thing. The white prisoner girl they brought back - was she the one they caught when they broke into Austin? They said it had been captured 25 years ago, but if it had been captured in Austin, it had only been 7 years since this happened in the film. Was she caught before? I remember seeing a girl prisoner after breaking into the city and I don't know if it was the same thing. If anyone can explain since I lost Part 1. If 25 years had passed, she would probably have been over 40 when they found her since she seemed to have grown up on the ground. Also, the way they were raping her when they caught her, it's hard to believe she would live to continue getting married and have Indian children. <br /> <br /> I must admit that there is nothing worse than John Voight playing Call in the sequel to Lonesome Dove or Lorena's incredible marriage with Pea Eye in McMurty's sequel to Lonesome Dove, which is not never been explained. Also, the way he killed Newt was in spite of them making the sequel with John Voight without his approval. <br /> <br /> If anyone can clear up these discrepancies, I would appreciate.
