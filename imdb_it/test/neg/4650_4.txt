This is a pleasure for fans of Z-grade movies. Here you will find writing and acting bad enough to rival anything Ed Wood has ever produced. Cameron Mitchell, a film veteran, is a former "Paragon Studios" makeup man who, after a bad accident at a social gathering, becomes a mad scientist embittered with a rubber scar on his face that takes revenge by kidnapping Paragon actors transforming them into living statues in his Secret Laboratory (tm) located in the local wax museum. Or are they zombies who do his bidding? It's not safe. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of your favorite movie cliches are here. Take a look at the villain's lab! Are those mysterious steaming vats of liquid? Tubes of colored water without explanatory purpose? Yay! And what, do we see free arms and legs arranged randomly like on a wooden grid? I bet! Be enchanted by the detestable detectives who act directly with Plan Nine! Now, enjoy a stupidly domesticated car chase, and hear more bizarre moans than you might wish. He raises an eyebrow to the demoralizing weft, made even more opaque by the totally meaningless ending that seems to have no connection with the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Basket of cheese and lots of fun for connoisseurs of bad films.
