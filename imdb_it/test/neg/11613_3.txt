While the overriding and excessive use of the game format is in total activity throughout the film, this is not the one that lets this image fall. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and the rather boring script that the film has so relied on a little too much. With an idea that has potential, the simple plot is still diminished by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation his character so categorically claims to feel. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be a bad idea if only the two main women could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr shows as usual a talented actor who is, overshadows the two actresses in their scenes together, which is constantly evident. The useless but intense sexual scene simply seems to exist in order to prevent the film from being too expressive verbally, giving the actors a well-deserved break from talking. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, Two Girls and a Guy has little to recommend it besides the formidable, if not out, performance of Downey Jr.
