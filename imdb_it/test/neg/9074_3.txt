It's been a long time since I was in the art theater and I went to see Douches Froides because he got good reviews in the newspapers. <br /> <br /> The fact is that with this film, it is so has no head or tail, but simply a temporal section on the life of the three main characters. <br /> <br /> When it started I already knew it would be a long session, but sometimes things can do better, in this case no. There is no real character development or interconnection between players. It starts in the middle of a situation, suddenly there is a girl and then there is a guy with whom he needs to be friends to satisfy his sporting ambitions, but the way they are put together is rather strange , since they are "just put together", so it seems. <br /> <br /> And suddenly they have sex with each other, at least one of which can be seen. The guilt or jealousy with the other guy is barely perceptible and in reality all I could think of during the film was "when will they have sex again?" And when you think about it, it's really crazy indeed. Because in practice it means that there is nothing that is really worth seeing, but three teenagers go there and this, at least for me, makes it a very lousy movie, avoid it and save money (my 7,50 is wasted), there are better auteur films than this. <br /> <br /> I give three stars for acting, one for each.
