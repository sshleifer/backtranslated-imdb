While I'm publishing this comment, IMDb is currently portraying Saboteur by Alfred Hitchcock at 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rated it less than half of that. Honestly, I can't say how such a bad movie could have come from what is probably the most consistent director I know. I saw about 10 other Hitch films from the 30s and 60s. Vertigo is my favorite so far, while Saboteur is easily the worst. It is hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch used the same formula in The 39 Steps with much more competence. My recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I stopped before the end and I don't want to go back and see the rest. If you have to watch it, then rent or borrow. Don't make the mistake I made and buy the DVD in good faith, obtained through Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even a master sometimes gets ruined, I suppose. <br /> <br /> EDIT: Maybe I was a little more difficult on this film than I should have been. It is certainly nowhere near Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that, but there are three reasons why I think I should evaluate it so below: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings with it some quality expectations. This film offers some of them, but they are obscured by the damned non-sensory applause. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a bit for all the 8+ votes this film is getting. Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors. True fans will find reasons to consider anything from him a work of art, but the high vote on IMDb gives more casual film fans like me the impression that this film is far better than it is in reality. <br /> <br /> 3) I spent $ 18 for this. Maybe if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10 I'd probably be a little less bitter. ;)
