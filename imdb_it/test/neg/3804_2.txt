... but apart from that, there is almost no redemption in the social value of this sequel to the original Poseidon Adventure. Where the hell are all the people in the original, including the rescue crew? Michael Caine undergoes his most humiliating performance to date (although he later triumphs with Jaws 4 down the street). Slim Pickens is simply embarrassing like a stereotypical Texas, and in general you just have to ask yourself, "Why did they bother?" Irwin Allen's latest attempt to collect the mania of disaster, I think.
