Alas, it seems that the golden days of fashionable Italian cinema have fallen by the wayside. And the recent idea of ​​the famous director Lamberto Bava is another obvious proof to this assumption. <br /> <br /> I felt lucky to see many films of this prolific director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although not entirely satisfactory, they have never been so boring. A suspicion that this new entry in my DVD collection was money thrown out of the wind arose shortly after the scene of the car accident showing an embarrassing and unlikely body position under the tipper car. <br /> <br /> And the sense of superficiality grew over the heavily narrated chain of events that followed. <br /> <br /> Dumb dialogues, defenseless screenplay and a total waste of talent from the international cast. The only character who gave a more or less acceptable performance was Mark's mischievous son who squeezed all the boredom. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mario's son's work on all accounts could not be greeted. <br /> <br /> I hope your Murder House will hopefully be an improvement.
