Medical student Paula Henning wins a seat at an exclusive medical school in Heidelberg. When the body of a young man he meets on the train turns on the table of his dissection, he begins to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death, and discovers a gruesome conspiracy perpetrated by an anti-hypocratic secret society operating within the school. Disturbing and coarse, many scary parts. He also has a good script and ends. But it has a poor part. What else could you see from this movie? It's a good horror and mysterious movie. But of course, if you like it, go buy it. If you don't, there's still no reason to waste your money on this. <br /> <br /> R rating for extreme graphic violence, sexual situations and obscenities.
