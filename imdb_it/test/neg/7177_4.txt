The two-page guys who work in a radio network range from trying to solve murders to perform in black faces between work shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller play in this 1945 whodunnit. Lots of quick talk, everyone yells at everyone, and the two guys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a true "shortie" at 59 minutes and has the feeling of being adapted from a play, as it takes place mainly on a stage of a radio station. We really don't care about any of the characters, which is probably why it is hardly ever shown. No big problem. This was Phil Karlson's second film as a director. We are not given any clue as to who could turn people away, so we simply follow the police detective and the guys on the page as they try to solve the mystery first. I won't say anything else to not give away any spoilers.
