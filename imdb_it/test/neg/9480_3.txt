Oh yes, I admit I was guilty of the crime of seeing this piece of junk. I can't say I was forced by aliens who put a gun on my head, tied me to a chair and stopped me from closing my eyes and turned this terrible excuse for a movie. No, I did it with free will. I deliberately tortured myself. Let's go through the fact here people. - Acting is an insult to humanity. - The plot (if it exists) is ridiculous. - The character development is horrendous - The characters that appear in the film are so clich√© that you would recognize them in your average comic. - The assembly is sloppy and unimaginative. - Camera work is low. - Dialogue is simply the worst in the history of cinema. - The director: well let's say, I bet it wasn't Hitchcock. <br /> <br /> So to add to these facts, there was absolutely no talent involved in this way. The director must now smoke crack to forgive himself for inflicting this poison on the world. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Passport to Paris is one of the worst films ever made. PERMANENT!
