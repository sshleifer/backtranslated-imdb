Doug McClure has starred in some of these genre adventures produced in Britain and this was the worst of all. I know that THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT has its critics, but please at least that film was characterized by location shots and relatively good production values. This is the problem with this film - Production values ​​go far beyond the affectionate territory "So bad they are good" and become "so bad I think I'll go see what happens in the other channels" <br /> <br /> An example it's the first scene with the intrepid Cushing and McClure meeting a monster. It is painfully obvious that the monster is a medium-sized man, dressed like a rubber monster made to look over twenty feet high through the embossed rear projection. It becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot. Did I mention that this is one of the most convincing pieces? No, actually it looks like it was shot in someone's living room with the rest of that year's budget. Even the ex-DOCTOR Peter Cushing is bland and what should have been a funny phrase "You can't hypnotize me - I'm British" is delivered very flat (a very similar phrase is pronounced by Cushing in HORROR EXPRESS) in a screenplay without characterization, plot and memorable dialogue. It is not just the fact that dialogue is not memorable, it is also rare and rare since monsters do not speak. It would not have been better to have the humanoid householders as in WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS so that they could explain the plot. Does anyone here know what the plot is? <br /> <br /> A very boring British film that even Caroline Munro's twin talents can't save. The entire mood of the film is summarized by the final sequence with two keystone policemen
