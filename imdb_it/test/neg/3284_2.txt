I shivered when I heard the first canned laugh in the first few seconds of the show, yet I gave it a chance. You know when someone offers a line that is only slightly fun and you hear a obviously fake laugh exploding in loud laughter which is a show aimed at idiots who need to be told "yes, it's fun, go ahead and laugh". <Br /> <br /> Ugh. I couldn't stand this show as it turned out. I can't speak for everyone - after all, some people actually appreciate this "Stacked" IDIOTIC show (which makes me want to throw up). I can imagine that those who like "Stacked" might like this drivel too. Some people still feel a little relief from the old "pull my finger". For me, this show is as witty as it is original. <br /> <br /> The themes were old and tired. The lines were lame and banal. The characters were the ones we've seen everywhere before - and the worst of all imaginable. <br /> <br /> So ... if you like things like the eruption of words and neighbors that say "pull the finger" .. you might really like this show. Otherwise ... pass it. It's stupid - and not in an intelligent or original way. This is old and tired like any show has ever been to its premiere.
