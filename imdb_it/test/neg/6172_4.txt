I decided to watch this movie to sleep. He kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was rather bland. <br /> <br /> The acting was good. I don't think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is credible as a mountain assassin can be. The dialogue in this film does not offer many opportunities for these actors to show their full potential, but they have nevertheless shone. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was fantastic. The music was good and the colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the spectators. Even the weather has improved the atmosphere of the film. Everything was well done. <br /> <br /> The failures of this film are in its history. The plot with the Mafia against Blackbird does not receive enough attention. The plot for Carmen and Wayne's divorce is not explained. The FBI seems to work very quickly here. Are there no documents for all these processes? Is it really that easy to dig your brother's body out of his grave, burn the corpse and identify it like you? There are too many loops in the plot for me to give this movie something higher than a score of 4 out of 10. I would not recommend this movie to people unless they are really bored and have smoked really good weed. Even if WoW doesn't work for maintenance, go find something better to do than watch this movie.
