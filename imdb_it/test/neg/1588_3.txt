The name of the DEA agent, Anslinger, is a nice internal joke - this is the name of the former drug czar who made marijuana illegal on his own. <br /> <br /> Despite this little knowledge of the book, the writers go on to have farmers who harvest and sell fresh leaves that are not seasoned, rather than seasoned buds. Furthermore, I always find it funny that film producers are never able to find marijuana plants for filming. You'd think there would be a business that would make the real ones for the movie business look fake or maybe they could film a couple of scenes in Amsterdam or Switzerland. I suppose you're asking too much of your budget. <br /> <br /> Probably the most interesting thing about the film is the attempt to cover the notion of exactly what is right and what is wrong with society and how the law tramples it and yet tries to do justice Nevertheless. <br /> <br />
