I'm furious! It's been a while since the last zombie movie I saw, so I couldn't wait to watch a good old zombie movie. HoTD2 was a big disappointment. A reasonable story but terrible acting, movies, dialogues and nauseating clich√©s and jokes. I haven't even seen the first one that is supposedly worse than this ... now I'm curious to know how bad it could have been! The film is full of errors and jokes. Who ever analyzes DNA using a blood sample! Why do these "special forces" who "went back to hell" fight like spoiled 6-year-old girls? We see fierce zombies that would take a bite whenever they get hundreds of them waving their arms towards our two "heroes", bringing them to the ground, then letting them go without even a scratch. I could go on and on, but life is too short and I've already lost a couple of hours watching this pathetic movie which is an insult to the film industry.
