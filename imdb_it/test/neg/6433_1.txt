"War is in your blood," says Rambo at the beginning of the film, "don't fight it". What? Is the writer eliminating Mickey from Sly? It is impossible for any person with an elementary school education to lose the joke here. Yet, Stallone pronounces it without a hint of irony. <br /> <br /> The same lack of humor applies to the film. Rambo IV is an exaggerated idiotic actioner who would have been fun without intention if he hadn't been violent. A redneck fantasy of the most basic kind in which the bad guys are so wicked, isn't it enough to kill them? you must dismember them with taste. Stallone stops without blue collar clich√© to express his opinion. It is not enough for the head-robber to be a pig-eating, throwing-children-in-fire type of sadist. He is also a homosexual pedophile. <br /> <br /> What's happening to IMDb? Is it taken over by the Rifle Society? How can this hideous excuse for such a high gross exploitation rate? I like a good action movie as much as the next one, but isn't that entertainment ?? this is the pornography of violence that trivializes and in the end denigrates the true tragedy of Myanmar. The only good thing about the movie is that Sly doesn't take off his shirt. That's why I'll give him a star ...
