This line is a good summary of this film. If you've read and watched 20 minutes of the movie, you'll know exactly how the rest of the movie will behave. Researchers named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) are searching for hell in Moscow's underworld. However he seems to have disappeared, and his friend Forno follows with a team to look for him. Could they find a more boring storyline? Some bad actors take care of an old man underground. The acting is very bad, the love story feels really useless and false, often there is no good reason for the way the characters act, nothing is scary and above all: nothing interesting is happening in the whole film . They walk, some leaders of the gang and other boys on the street ask, they still walk, they complain, they find the old man, and then they run, and finally they find the way out of the underground. <br /> <br /> The only thing that gives me to give this film the lowest of all votes is the atmosphere. If you just want to watch a movie for this, this could be a good choice. It's dark and it's mystical and dark. However, the rest of the film is really boring. You sit there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something is happening. Something is actually happening, but they are not very well executed. For example, I never noticed when one of the characters disappeared, and I swear I wasn't sleeping or something. And I don't understand what's dangerous with these children ... They run together underground, scratching it with sticks (I suppose it's somehow scary). <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you need immediate some dark atmospheres.
