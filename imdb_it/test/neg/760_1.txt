A terrible film; badly written, badly acted, clich√©, banality, waste. The premise is so good and an opportunity to educate black cowboys, but the film is really terrible. It's a curious mix of a bad movie from the 1950s by Randolph Scott B and a bad western from the 70s. The villains are cardboard, laughter flashbacks, heartbreaking dialogue. <br /> <br /> Deliberate anachronisms (such as Victorian rap singers and modern bad words like "motherf **** er") are irritating to the extreme. <br /> <br /> A Frankenstein monster dead on the laboratory table.
