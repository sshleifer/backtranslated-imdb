The titles eventually read "EVERYTHING directed by Shigeru Izumiya". This is an appropriate way to express it because it seems that the filmed material of different projects has been put together in some way, barely even trying to make all this work coherently. It looked more like one of those music clips that are marketed as movies to collect those commercials, except that here there is no sellable music and live performances, except for one scene, which can also be marketed as a strange music video in Japan. Everything. <br /> <br /> It doesn't make sense. Even visually it is not too special, even if it has its moments (for example the female creature with the "dust of death" that is tied to a bed base and some morphing sh! T everywhere) and certainly has an industrial feeling to it. Usually I will define the amateur effects, but what this film offers in this regard is more disconcerting than anything else. Do you remember those low-cost video effects of music videos from the 70s and 80s that make them look so dated, like a photo inside a photo that flies across the screen? There are a lot of these effects in this and for no apparent reason. The seemingly more sleepy effort comes in the form of a collage of images. The images look like album covers. Everything. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happens with the subtitles of the version I've seen. The Chinese ones (or whatever those hieroglyphics) sometimes seem to appear when nothing is said and the English ones often appear without the Chinese ones. English subtitles talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?), And a mind without a body, which provides what comes closest to a comprehensible conflict between the characters in this film. A boy (a scientist dude) says that life without flesh is dead while another boy (a metamorphosed man) claims that his mind is beyond his body now that he has the "dust of death" blown in his face and who now knows the secrets of meat and so on; the metamorphic guy is visibly unmasked by the scientist's statements. Everything. <br /> <br /> Erm, The End - All Written By Perception de Ambiguity
