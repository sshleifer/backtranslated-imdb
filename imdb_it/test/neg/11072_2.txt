What a shock. For beginners, I couldn't stand the constant screaming and the sound of panic all the time. It didn't scare me, horrify me or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying. The jerky movements of the camera were also annoying. The plot was the same as almost all other economic horrors. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work in the rest of the plot. And then there's the ending. I'm still not sure what to do with it. I guess it should have been a stroke of genius, so shed some light on the situation, but it was simply stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had a couple of those little symbols of winners / nominations on the prizes, so I thought it couldn't be too bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should probably leave it on the shelf.
