The discussion has been held a thousand times. Is the "merchant of Venice" anti-Semitic? (I think so.) Isn't it always unfair to highlight this little anti-Semitism in another great piece of art? (I think it is not.) Does this game stain Shakespeare's reputation as the greatest playwright in the world? (I think so.) Do you have a role if you didn't do it for a particular racist purpose? (I don't think so.) Michael Radford knew all this and that's why he added to his film a prologue about the pitiful situation of the Jews in Renaissance Venice. <br /> <br /> In vain; because the show remains what it has always been and the new trick only gives one (but futile) hope that someone had the courage to set something that remains a permanent outrage, not because his level of anti-Semitism would be particularly shocking, but because the screenplay is named after William Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Why spend so much time portraying a man's hatred: Shylock? Why hire a great and serious actor like Al Pacino, if in the end everything is being ruined in this outrageous (but hey, I'm not responsible - Shakespeare-wrote) the court scene. And now I want to be very precise, just like Shylock himself. <br /> <br /> He asks for his right, according to the contract that - not very responsible - Christian Antonio, who has always looked at him, signed in full awareness of the consequences. Of course, what Shylock requires is cruel and useless, but that's not the point. What we see (or we should see) is a man who has been humiliated all his life, to the point that all that remains about him is his hatred. I think it's certainly a bit inappropriate to teach a man like things like compassion. <br /> <br /> But at this point, the drama / film (I'm one and the same now) at this point is .. becomes a soap opera! The cruel fool with his knife, the horrified (but rather petty) public, the poor "victim" tied to his chair. True, Antonio accepts his fate but why can't he just say a single word, "excuse"? I think we must not lose many words on the ridiculous verdict of the young Doctor of Padua; it is a true "popular verdict" not very different from what one would see 400 years later in official Nazi trials. From one minute to the other, this Jew is robbed of everything he owned, condemned to be baptized a Christian and cast out. <br /> <br /> Isn't it so outrageous ??? Obviously not. History passes to the romantic complexity of the rings and to its happy end. <br /> <br /> What can be learned in Libeskind's Jewish Museum in Berlin and in similar places around the world is that anti-Semitism often goes unnoticed by the masses because what is so devastating for a minority or some individuals it is incorporated in the presumed greater good for the majority. It should be exactly the task of each of us to develop a sensitivity to detect and unmask these trends. <br /> <br /> I do not accept the excuse that this film was created to empathize with the abused Shylock (it just doesn't work). I don't think anyone can be forced to be merciful. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie; in particular, not for an Oscar.
