Stay Alive has a story very similar to some Asian horror films that include technology over history. Some of these Asian horror films are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. So, the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very trivial and obvious but the directors behind it didn't know how to add something new or interesting to the clichés in Stay Alive. This movie is totally lousy. But a very important thing. All the elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of "horror" films: superficial characters, nothing suspenseful, stupid '' horror '' that makes you laugh and light violence. to create something original or disturbing. I don't want to waste any more time writing about this pathetic film. I'll just give you one tip: don't watch this movie. I really hated it.
