I vaguely remember this movie. I remember him for the only reason he is the only film he has ever walked in !! and since then I've never seen it available for rent EVERYWHERE !! I can't ruin it for anyone because I can barely remember it !! Thinking, looking at the cast, it seemed like a winner, directed by John Landis, but good god, they must have been paid a lot for this drivel !! All I can remember is that the father disappears and the family tries to look for him, trying to put a real photograph in a computer's disk drive. I left about half an hour after that. I must confess though, I'd like to see if I can get a copy, just to see if it's really that bad !! <br /> <br /> It wouldn't surprise me if it was on the black of every actor on the list! I mean Christopher Lee was in this ?? The legend of all the villains, who had been in Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings ?? As I said - the black list movie, The Stupids!
