This is the kind of nightly cable movie usually associated with Andrew Stevens or Shannon Tweed. Although unlike most Tweed and Stevens T & A motor vehicles, this is incredibly boring! <br /> <br /> Let's go to the point. The real reason to watch this non-thriller is to see Shannon Doherty's breasts. Anyone who says otherwise is a LIAR! However, most of her hot sex scenes seem to be all smoke and mirrors. <br /> <br /> Note that all the shots in which his head and chest show at the same time are quick peek flashes. The frames in which the camera stands on its naked body, there is little or no face attached or behind a wet and dripping shower door. <br /> <br /> All of you observers out there know what it means - Double body! <br /> <br /> I must admit though that the ending in which Doherty is tied, blindfolded and threatened by a knife, provided a certain fetish thrill. <br /> <br /> If you find a VHS copy anywhere, buy it! Like all those involved, they are probably too embarrassed to let this be released on DVD!
