It's about bored snoring. This movie for third choice motorcyclists put me to sleep as soon as the opening credits arrived on the screen. The shame is that the cast included many good actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> A take-off of the western classic, High Noon, this is basically the story of a former US Army green cap (Henriksen) trying to convince someone to help him free a city from a horse of band of gruesome bikers. <br /> <br /> Everyone is looking, but the script is at the elementary school level. Sad to see Oscar winner Kennedy in a similar defeat from his outstanding performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, this would be a perfect movie to rent .......... you will sleep in no time at all!
