I just want to have the good sense to turn this film off at the beginning, when I knew it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Instead I gave the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to improve. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with the film. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with a plot. The acting consists of a boy who wants to be John Cusack, but he can't get it out. The main character is a girl trying to be Claire Daines. Unfortunately, he can't get it out either. They are in love, even if God knows why. And in the end I was hoping they'd all kill each other, so I could believe that none of these guys would ever contaminate the world again.
