Arthur Hunnicutt plays a very stereotyped role as a mountain man (probably the Ozarks) who goes hunting with his favorite predator dog. However, the dog seems to drown when Hunnicutt leaps after him. It becomes obvious soon enough that, despite Hunnicutt and his dog wandering after leaving the water, both died in the water - as no one answers when he talks to them and sees and hears people talking about his death and the dog. Yet, strangely enough, Hunnicutt is REALLY slow in absorption and it takes him a while to understand that they are talking about him! I think this was actually done as a fill, as there wasn't really enough material to fill the half-hour time slot. <br /> <br /> Later, in the "surprise touch", he comes to Heaven - or at least his concept of the place. He's invited, but since they won't allow dogs, he has other ideas! Overall, reasonably well acted but of dubious spiritual value! Without twists or irony, this episode is a bit boring - not "Twilight Zone-y" enough for my taste.
