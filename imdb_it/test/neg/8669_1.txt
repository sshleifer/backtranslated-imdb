Why did they have to make such a terrible adaptation? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classics seems like a huge disappointment. The characters are completely wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. Everything seems rather hasty. The release of the 1999 film based on the same novel seems a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I'm really happy that "Pride and Prejudice" will not be redone as part of this project and we will see the great and famous Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. if you missed this production of "Mansfield Park", consider your luck!
