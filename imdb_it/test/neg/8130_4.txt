The greedy baron of the land in the small western town of Prairie City wants all farmers to leave their land, using intimidation tactics and arson to get them cleared; it seems that the city is swimming above the oil, and when a Swedish peasant refuses to leave, he is mowed by the baron's rental gun. The farmer's seafaring son arrives early, slowly realizing what he's struggling against and trying to gather the rest of the residents to fight. Another story of lawlessness in-the-West, with everyone under the thumb of the bad (who naturally holds all the cards). Derived and uncomfortable at times to look, with a long wait before our heroic stoic finally manages to raise the hair again. Sterling Hayden's Swedish mid-heart accent is a big problem, even if it cuts a strong and nice presence on the screen and almost makes the image worth watching. Director Joseph H. Lewis rigidly stages most of the scenes, such as a TV western, and the soundtrack of Gerald Fried is of no help, although the rich black and white cinematography of Ray Rennahan is excellent. An independent production distributed through United Artists, the film has a bizarre beginning (starting from the shots of the final, followed by shots from the middle section of the film), but it has a certain needle-punched power that surely brings the viewer to Hayden's side. ** from ****
