Corey Haim will never be known as one of the great actors of his time, but at least in films like "Licensed To Drive", he was more in his element ... lowbrow humor. <br /> <br /> Dean Koontz's book "Watchers" was one of his first works, and probably still his best so far. Unfortunately, this magnificent tale of a brilliant dog, a deranged mutant and a genetic experiment gone wrong is horribly slaughtered. The acting is so lifeless, you might think about watching a zombie movie. Only the dog gives a respectable performance, and if you want to see a decent film about a dog, it's better to watch "The Incredible Journey", "Cujo" or even "CHOMPS" ... okay, maybe not "CHOMPS" <br /> <br /> If you've read the book, avoid this movie at all costs. If you haven't read the book, read and avoid this movie. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> A slightly better translation of a book by Dean Koontz is the capable thriller, "Phantoms".
