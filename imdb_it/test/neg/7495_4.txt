Of course, it's hard to be gay, especially in the south. We have it. Beyond ... and again. <br /> <br /> What really stands out is that the filmmakers focused almost exclusively on the "extreme" characters of these gay bars in the small town; drag queens, the dingy bullshit of a long-closed bar, and a brutally murdered dude to be gay, had nothing to do with any of the bars that were at the center of this movie. <br /> <br /> There have been snippets of interviews with other people, viewers could, perhaps, be better able to relate. But they were overlooked, practically skipped, perhaps shown in the background. <br /> <br /> It would have been more interesting, at least for me, to listen to the experiences of the most common gay men and women who were either enriched or otherwise from the experiences of a small gay bar in the city and / or the absence of that community.
