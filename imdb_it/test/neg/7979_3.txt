This was my very first film on "Bollywood" and I found it in the same way that many other viewers did - through "Ghost World". Having read a little bit about the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand a little bit why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in a horror movie. But "Something for everyone" is not always added to a cohesive product. <br /> <br /> The ultra-groovy musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" conquered the world in a way that probably could not have done in 1965. Now it's all on the internet, with many people scrambling for a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya does an incredible job dancing and taking it, making it all new, fresh and fun even when a normal person feels exhausted! She rules! <br /> <br /> On the beach with Miss Kitty is a light and fun game, in total contrast to the plot of horror. However, I find myself singing it in Hindi a week later. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life listen to what I say leave your pain and join the party follow my advice <br /> <br /> who wants to live live with laughter and sing let the people of this world be beaten down and relax what do you know? come to me and I will explain to you <br /> <br /> whoever will see me will stop worrying in this world of fish swimming freely here and there <br /> <br /> my second favorite number in the film is The Butler's Dream in which Mehmood is fascinated by Miss Kitty's dance. Tiki-like electric idols are wonderfully tacky like the whole set of this number. Online, I had seen it describe how it would have happened if "Liberace vomits" !! Very funny. <br /> <br /> Gumnaam is not a good film as a whole. That's why I gave it a rating of 3. It's actually a real stinker in a movie with some fun and kitschy musical numbers that have nothing to do with the murder plot.
