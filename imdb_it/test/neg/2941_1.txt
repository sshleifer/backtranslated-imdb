I saw this movie on Blockbuster and I thought it could be a good Sunday night movie when there is nothing else to do. So I bought it used, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Even though it was cheap, my money would have been better spent on a nail to drive through my foot. <br /> <br /> The film started well. Kinda Dark and mysterious. As a child I was always fascinated by vampire and samurai movies. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first fight scene was pretty good. I was excited for the rest of the film. Then the film took a serious imprint. <br /> <br /> I understand that this was a great success in the east. I guess because of the twins. I don't see it though. This film, apart from the first 10 minutes, was absolutely horrible. So many movies in this genre have the potential to be great and blow terribly. This is just another victim. <br /> <br /> The role of Jacki Chan in this film makes no sense. Whyyyyyyyy? Complete nonsense. He probably made some money though. <br /> <br /> The only interesting thing about this movie is the swords they use. Nice idea. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
