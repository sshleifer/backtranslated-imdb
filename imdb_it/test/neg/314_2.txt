Jack-O (1995) was a really bad film, we're talking about snoozefest x 100, no entertainment, no budgets, no gore, Z-level actors, etc. This film was a terrible addition to the film industry horror and should not have been done !!! The only reason I bought this movie is because I knew that Linnea Quigley was in there, and sure enough, she does her mandatory nude shower scene, which is adorable yes. <br /> <br /> But as for the movie itself ... ...... I fell asleep at the 40 minute stage and I had no desire to finish it, it's just a great time OK. <br /> <br /> I love horror movies, I am an avid fan, a MASSIMO fan, I love cheap horrors, I like everything, but I hated this garbage, so I think it will tell you everything you need to to know about "JACK-O". <br /> <br /> I give you this movie 2/10, the "2" is for the 2 minute Linnea shower scene, the film itself is a total ZERO !!!!
