This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action movie. Billy Dee plays a young man tired of racism who decides to take things into his own hands. It is quite gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters, but it is not all that interesting and the character of Billy Dee, although abused by white authority figures, is not really nice. He is also hurt by his extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to see since it's a good representation of social issues in the 1970s.
