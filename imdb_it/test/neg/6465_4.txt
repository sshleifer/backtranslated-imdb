This is certainly a less known comedy from the 1920s. The only reason I saw it is because it was on a Kino Films DVD with non-Laurel and Hardy shorts with Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also on average below average for the style film. Compared to the shorts by Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in terms of quality and humor. Furthermore, the accompanying music was rather poor by the standards of other silent DVDs. I ended up turning off the sound due to the inadequacy of the music to set the right mood. But despite this, it's still worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I have to be honest about this short. It was the last of 8 on this DVD and when I arrived, I was rather bored by the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 short films. So, it is possible that the film could be a little better than a 4 - but certainly, if this is the case, not better than a 5! The film is a rather classic short film about an incompetent deliveryman. Nothing particularly interesting and there are certainly many quieter best short films.
