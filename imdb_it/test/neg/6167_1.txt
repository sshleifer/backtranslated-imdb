The most predictable film I've ever seen ... extremely boring, I seem to have seen a hundred movies with the same storyline as this. Acting is OK at best, there is no action in reality and there are absolutely no emotions. Capable actors with a terrible script I think it could have been written better by a tenth grader. I felt like a task to keep an eye on because I was hoping there was something in this film that would set it apart from all the other rejections, but this was fine. The whole film was waiting for me to have something nice happen but it never arrived. I have never voted for films and I have never reviewed films, but this film was so bad that I had to log in here and post a review to try to save some poor souls from wasting time (and / or money) on this film. I hacked it and I wish I'd never even wasted hard drive space. If I spent 10 dollars to see it at the cinema, I'd kill myself.
