I'm at a loss. The whole film makes absolutely no sense. It was like watching a Soderburg movie for football. The cut of the camera, the rhythm, all so copied. I thought the subject wasn't too serious to be treated like it was. Yes, we know all the Southerners like football and beauty contests. Should we be submerged by it as an audience? I watched because of Lee and Jay. I expected young talents gathered in the style of Dead Poet's Society or similar to Remember the Titans. I was completely discouraged by the film. You didn't have the characters. He was driven by the character, but for the most part you didn't understand anyone's motives or actions. The only guy who's a mom is obsessed with being a football player. Why is it so silent? What is your pact? Do we really need the scene with him to "prove" his heterosexuality? Why should we worry? The film gave us insights into these children's lives and offered no money for treatment. It didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> And why show a film about a team that has lost? I know it's real life, but who makes films about losers? Give us compensation for these guys who work as hard as they do with all their "conceivable" problems, damn it. We have nothing. At the end of the film we got a small beep that told us that Mojo won next year with the third crossbar (Lee). Why didn't you follow that story? What were we supposed to get out of this? The film has guided you, but it hasn't got you anywhere. I felt like something was missing. It looked like a bad genetic cross between Varsity Blues and Remember the Titans. At least those two movies took you somewhere. Friday Night Lights spoke of a losing team that had lost its leading player at the beginning of the film. The actor who played him was great. You were completely annoyed by him, that was the point, but at least you understood why. They made sure you understood him, but he couldn't play, so why make sure we get his problems? <br /> <br /> And the other team in the playoffs ... do we have to believe that those are high school kids? Those men looked like college seniors or professional players in their thirties. Who were they trying to joke about? I know the other team must have looked intimidating, but he was crossing the line a little. I liked the gritty element of them who negotiated with the black team, but again, how it was adapted to the general theme of the film. Nothing put together. The characters knew a lot more about each other than we were, and this was strange to me. Jay's characters had absolutely nothing to add, but he was on display. It was all just a mess. Not worth a movie ticket or rental fee.
