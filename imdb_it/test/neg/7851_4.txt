The German emigrant and the uber-hambone actor Paul Muni, who has never seen a scene that does not want to chew, plays in "black face" to play a humble Mexican immigrant who lives in Los Angeles and who is making headway in world. If this squeaky vehicle reminds anyone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as a Cuban uncultivated in the SCARFACE remake, don't be too surprised. The characters are quite similar, and both become incredibly pop-eyed when the script requires it. Hispanics around the world should be very offended by Muni's exaggerated performance while this dizzying Mexican lives the American dream, the consequences will be damned. I imagine that Benicio DelToro's grandfather was not available. A young bleached blonde, Bette Davis, plays one of Muni's love interests; in the end he goes mad for the love of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute blast, Davis is the only reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. There is a delirium almost at the end when Muni asks the girl of his dreams to marry him - a white farm girl with one of those thirty-year-old made-up accents that Hollywood loved so much - and she calls him a wild and brute, of "a different tribe ". Muni immediately turns into Mr. Hyde and pursues her in a premature death. In the final scene, a repentant Muni tells his sober priest that he will return to his own people, his own species. End of the film Finis. This is all he wrote. It was said that Muni had hired a Mexican gen-oo-ine as a driver to study the manner of speaking and the physical habits of this exotic creature. Yowza!
