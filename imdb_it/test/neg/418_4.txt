Because they didn't follow the book ... I'm really sad and disappointed. I couldn't wait to see this movie, however, if you read the book (maybe recently), it could be very difficult to stay objective. My wife hadn't read the book, and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the disappointment are: 1) The involvement of Cern ... gone with the wind, a real shame, there is a very small part at the beginning, where antimatter is created, but this also does not stick to the facts (why not, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon was involved would have been a perfect start for Movie_ 2) The line of demarcation between the pope (deceased) and Camerlegno completely disappeared ... this completely complicates the reason for the antimatter theft 3) The dividing line between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra is completely non-existent <br /> <br /> All in all, plot too shaky, and I can't understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against it. Maybe I should revisit this film in 10 years, when I can't remember the excellent book anymore (big chance to forget the book I fear) <br /> <br /> Really sorry for the negative review, which was ruined by expectations
