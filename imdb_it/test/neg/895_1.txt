I know it sounds crazy but yes, I'm a big fan of House Party 1 and 2 (and proud of it !!). I hated part 3, and then here comes part 4. Was I like teasing myself with this? Kid 'n Play is nowhere to be found in this film, and it would have been ok if they had not named the movie House Party 4, as if it were somehow, shape, form or fashion than its predecessors. Whenever this movie arrives late at night in the United States, I shoot my TV with a rifle. Frankly, it's really so atrocious. * hurling * <br /> <br /> As the only remaining fan of Kid 'n Play who will actually admit to being a fan (tee hee hee), I was appalled. Remember that stupid immature group kid? They made their way into House Party 3. Ok, okay and well, but how can part 4 be only about them and nothing else and it also seems that they are not even the same children as the third party. * Confused !!!! * House Party fans: Do yourself a favor and stick to House Party 1 and 2 and Class Act. Besides that, everything else is ridiculous.
