This is a very very boring and uninteresting action film, and without Chuck Norris it would have been unbearable!, Plus the low budget shows great time! Some of the fights were good, but the story is ridiculous, and there are no bad ones at all. The dialogue was ridiculous. I had some problems finishing this film, but Chuck Norris made it a bit bearable. I have nothing else to say, since I was only paying half attention, because it was so incredibly boring, but in the end it took a while. The management is terrible. Don Hulette, he does a terrible job here, with a bad picture, a terrible rhythm, and overall the film seemed boring! There is no blood. The acting was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, kicked his ass and made the film almost bearable (Chuck's rules!). George Murdock is terrible as the main villain, and very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor, he's decent here, and he had good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is as decent as Chuck's brother. Overall it's quite simple to AVOID! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves him from the BOMB assessment).
