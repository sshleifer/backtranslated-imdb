I thought it was a comedy !! What fun! I can't believe that Forsythe or Reynolds really do appear in this piece of junk .. And then there's the beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever this piece of eye candy is called. It appears that he put on a few pounds from his central Playboy pdc ... about 50 !! The plot is ridiculous, the acting absolutely horrendous, and the old tired clich√© that runs over and over, boy did it take a lot of resistance to sit through this dog .. The only thing that was worth it was the laughter! ! And there are ABUNDANCE! If you really want to kill yourself, an hour and a half choose this child at the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of dead people to watch with you. I think it's because of what was written ... it sounds like they were thinking of a real low rent, a drug-induced audience for this ..
