I know, it's a movie. But when it comes to representing real life (in any case) it should be as faithful as possible. I'm sorry, but "El Misterio Galíndez" is not as accurate as it seems. Nor is the Dominican Republic described as it really is. In fact, it shocked me to see that the filming location in Santo Domingo was actually Cuba. And incredibly, films with Cuban themes (Havana, The Lost City, Sugar Bitter, The Godfather Part II) were actually filmed at Santo Domingo! So what happened here? Why did they shoot the film in Cuba instead of D.R.? Spanish dialogues with a Cuban accent are horrible! Those are not Dominicans! Historically, Galíndez would never have been hanged. He may also have been hit, beheaded or died from the inhuman torture he was receiving. So he threw his body into the Caribbean sea. But Trujillo would never have ordered death by strangulation. His sick mind would not allow it. <br /> <br /> The acting was not delivered as planned. Harvey Keitel seems to be expecting a paycheck. I prefer the lead actress of "Deep Blue Sea". The rest of the cast would have been excellent in some Cuban films, and the same goes for the selected shooting location. <br /> <br /> I suggest "La fiesta del chivo", from the bestseller author Mario Vargas Llosa, directed by his cousin Luis Llosa. It's a little more realistic with Dominican history. The character of Trujillo is very well interpreted and the Galindez incident is treated very briefly in this film.
