First of all, the editing of this film consisted of a big flaw that I don't understand how it was missed: you constantly see the microphones on your head moving in and out of the film. The first time I saw it I just said "well, mistakes happen" and I wiped it out. After about the tenth time, he began to become incredibly irritating and carelessly amusing. If you haven't seen the movie yet, try counting how many times you see the microphone; could make the game quite interesting. <br /> <br /> Now, regarding the film. This film started with the stuff of a rather solid "ghost" story; however, the coup de theater eventually completely ruined it. You start watching the film under the hypothesis, hinted at by TV commercials, that the haunted house is made up of ghosts that can only be seen by children; especially young children, which makes it even more frightening that they will not be able to effectively warn the family of the imminent danger. The opening scene did a good job deceiving the public that this would remain the premise of the film. ** (SPOILER) ** The film begins with the family being followed and finally killed by an "invisible" force in the house. The idea that only children can see these ghosts is set in motion when the daughter, at the beginning of the film, asks her little brother to tell her where "it's right" before "he" grabs her and drags her screaming in the cellar. The young boy is also witness to this alleged "invisible force" that kills his mother after she told him to hide under the bed. After his family was killed, the boy tries to escape and hide only to be ripped off. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film started with the fabric of a rather ghostly film in which the family would be chased by an "invisible force" with their unique hopes of survival that rest on sightings of a two-year-old child. This began to be ruined less than in the middle of the film when the daughter began to see even the ghosts; completely ruining the illusion "only children can see" staged by advertising and the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Regardless, the film did not actually "spoil" until the end of the plot. In which the man who had helped the family cultivate the farm appears to have been the man responsible for killing the family at the beginning of the film. Suddenly, after being attacked by a swarm of crows, the man snaps and tries to kill his mother, daughter and son while he has a psychotic break in which he believes they are his family; who killed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> The whole plot twist finally created a whole list of unanswered questions and let me go to the point. First, why were the family souls trapped in a house? If the director was opting for a Ju-On (The Grudge) approach in which the family, after being angry, would haunt the house and kill anyone who entered, because the obsession stopped after the father was "captured "from the ghosts of his family? If the ghosts just wanted to kill the man who killed them, why were they attacking the new family? Here's another one for you. It takes several months from the moment you sow the seeds until the plants bloom completely in time for the harvest. This tells me that the man who killed his family in the beginning, the man the ghosts had apparently held a grudge with the entire movie, had lived on the property for months. During all this time, why didn't the ghosts kill him? <br /> <br /> This film includes a lot of clich√©s about the "horror film" and an obvious combination of ideas from other horror films. Anyway, I'm telling you, this movie could still have gone well, if it wasn't for the twist in the end. It's like they ran out of budget and just threw something together for a finale. In order for this film to be a success, they should have remained with the premise "only children can see them" and ended up with the family barely moving away or being killed like the family at the beginning (it would have opened the door for the possible sequel).
