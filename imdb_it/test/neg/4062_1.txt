The plane is a Jumbo 747. The cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. In the film the pilots do not climb the stairs in the cabin of the 1st Class to reach the cockpit. They walk to the front of the 1st Class cabin and through the doors in the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the first-class cabin has a wardrobe for the jackets and a TV screen. In addition to this there is the radar dome. Before take-off, a 747 is shown which starts the taxi on the runway. At the time of take-off, the plane shows only two engines. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was responsible for the continuity of this film? During the first part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes the toilets - another fars burst !!! After that, the front of the plane becomes the back and vice versa. At this point I stopped watching. Absolutely rubbish !!!
