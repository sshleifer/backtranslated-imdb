I would like to start by saying that I love cinema, literature and Japanese culture in general. I've seen a lot of Japanese movies and enjoyed them, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) is ridiculous. The two characters that dominate the action - the "lord of evil" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn and crazy artist" are pure types without nuances or nuances, and all their actions derive from cartoonistic extremes. The film wants to show horrific scenes of violence and raw emotions, but many of these scenes are so exaggerated that they become really ridiculous and the general feeling is that of a film made for TV that went off the rails. If this rarely screened movie falls into your hands or arrives in your city, save yourself and pass by.
