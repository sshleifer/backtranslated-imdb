They took a story dear to the heart of the people of Edinburgh, a true story and they changed it as Hollywood has already done in many stories. The end result is a well-made film for those who do not know the story but totally different and inaccurate. The original film of this story that Walt Disney himself supervised used the right breed dog that is crucial to this story and did not make John Gray something special he was a poor Shepard who died in poverty in the hotel. If you like history, look at the original Disney for a more exciting story. The cast is a shame and the potential was there for a formidable remake of a classic tale. Read the book for an accurate occurrence of the story. And if you really like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
