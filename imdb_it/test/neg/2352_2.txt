This film was one of the few that actually caused me pain. It could be appreciated by anyone who thinks it would be fun to see his mother in a crowded nightclub full of people half her age "inventing" a totally ridiculous dance in a completely misleading effort to be "fashionable" . Seeing Ingrid Bergman dive into such a pitiful performance on the dance floor was hard to watch. I was embarrassed. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, disco music wasn't realistic at all - it's the phony idea of ​​some Hollywood director about what pop music was like at the time. This is always a total embarrassment in most films of that era - surrogate music is canned and bears only a painful resemblance to the music that was actually popular in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Mathau is hopelessly miscible as a kind of woman's man; it just looks lascivious, grotesque. Hawn's wide-eyed innocence is simply too silly. The handsome neighbor in his apartment is portrayed too seriously and seriously. He looks like a Brady kid who got lost in this farce. Painful and pitiful mess.
