I rented this movie for $ 5 and was sorry I didn't ... I wouldn't give a 5c for this if I knew. This is the worst movie ever ... None of the filming locations were in the former Yugoslavia, map to the beginning of what ... ??? The British actors are trying to speak in Serbian eg. pretending to be Serbs and they did it terribly badly. My first language is Serbian and I could not understand what they were mumbling. They drove a large jeep in a country where 3 sides (Croats, Serbs and Muslims) are at war and wrote peace on it 4 Sarajevo ??? Ah, ah, how stupid it was ... I don't know why English is doing stupid war movies like this ... or even if they do it because they blame the Serbs for everything, when there were also two other parts in one war. And we all know that they were also killing them, not just sitting and pretending innocent, so they should at least show the whole truth. This film also features Harrison's flowers, Behind the lines of the enemies, The hunting party and a few others were total bullshit and this was demonstrated for example The hunting party was the biggest loser in 2007/08 spent 20 million and has earned 800,000 ha, ah, that sucks ... The truth will come sooner or later. be Serbian !!!
