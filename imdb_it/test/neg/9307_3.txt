Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of non-stop disasters and near-death experiences reminiscent of Warner Brothers cartoons on Saturday morning. Like the coyote who falls from the cliff 5 times per episode, the "protagonist" (more like an over-grown klutzy child) always manages to postpone his meeting with the Grimm Reaper. <br /> <br /> This Australian surprise "is offensively funny, sometimes even depressing. The 2 (out of ten) are for visual acrobatics (some never tried by anyone after Daffy Duck) and the use of bright colors (as in those high-class national laundry detergent ads). <br /> <br /> There may be an age group in which this "comedy" finds a following. I certainly passed that age a long time ago. Calling all preteens: here is a "ha-ha" for you!
