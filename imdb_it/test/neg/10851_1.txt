The advertising of this film suggests that it is shocking and sensational. Well, we opera lovers see some strange show in opera houses, so we are not shocked by the fact that the Duke of Mantua pissed during his filming of La Donna Ã¨ Mobile, nor is it sensational to see Gilda sing Dear Name in the bathroom . It is simply coarse and boring. What stands out in this film is its lack of imagination. Director Corina Van Eijk sets up the Palazzo del Duca in a squalid pool. In fact, he is not the Duke, he is just a character named Duka, so it is difficult to understand why he has many strikers and his fool, Rigoletto. Rigoletto lives in a council apartment which is furnished with an orange sofa and decorated with spotted wallpaper which is a must among avant-garde directors. Duke's, Duka's suspects go around with scooters (Yawn). <br /> <br /> Concepts imposed on a work like this can produce unexpected and involuntary humor. What can we do about the fact that Gilda has a maid, even if she lives in a council apartment? When the call arrives that Monterone is taken to prison, we see him leave the pool by two assistants in pink shorts. He imagines he will be accused of having urinated in a public pool. <br /> <br /> It was normal for the films of the opera to be synchronized with the lips 20 years ago, but today there are no excuses. A dubbed work is like a soft porn. Do not believe in what is happening because artists do not make enough efforts. The actress in the role of Gilda doesn't seem to have learned her lines well. He barely moves his lips when he should sing. When he sings Dear Name in the tub he lies down with his legs slightly open. It is difficult to determine from which orifice the sound comes from. The Duke, then, limits himself to singing while he engages in cunnilingus with Maddalena, giving a new meaning to the phrase yodel in the canyon. <br /> <br /> The sound atmosphere never seems right with the orchestra that sometimes sounds like it is played through a transistor radio. The slow and disarranged times are preferred so that the overall effect is of a karaoke in the local pub. <br /> <br /> This is a film from a production of Opera Spanga. Spanga is a village in Friesland in the Netherlands. Normally they perform in a tent in a field. If I had been watching this performance in a tent in a field in Friesland, I would have been quite forgiving. Filming this production and giving it a worldwide audience, the villagers also show themselves open to world ridicule.
