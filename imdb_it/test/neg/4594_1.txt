Where to start with 'Speck' the true story of Richard Speck, a murderer of eight nurses in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on some of the low-budget films of Full Moon Releasing (like Birth Rite) and here he works from a script by Don Adams (then) of Full Moon. Unfortunately, while the film looks like an accurate portrait of the horrendous crime, the script is not great, perhaps because the divisions of the real Speck weren't terribly interesting !? Despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic, it is a cheap cashing of the acclaimed cinematic films of serial killers of the same period (such as "Ed Gein"). Filmed in a dirty brown, not entirely sepia, for the most part and narrated by star Doug Cole, the film fails to present the horror of crime because the narrative is irritating, the coloring distracts from the story and crime, even if gruesome and shocking to look at, it is simply this and no editorial work seems to have occurred in what is practically a poor quality camcorder for displaying events. There is no actual examination of Speck's motivation or life, just an economic blow to a gruesome crime. Released by Full Moon, there is little evidence of Full Moon's best result here, Charles Band ignoring his rule that his films feature fantasy killings (such as dolls, monsters and so on) and not knowing what to do with this new reality . Incidentally Band has introduced a special label for these films called "Shadow Entertainment". The band said it regrets the Full Moon production period alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose Creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speak very badly of Charles Band). The era of Tempe is characterized by a uniform editing of Apple Mac and brutal shooting by hand, very similar to a home movie. Speck maintains these qualities and while Witchouse 3, for example, has managed to use them well, Speck is simply boring and coarse.
