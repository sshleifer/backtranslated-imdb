**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> Mountain hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a back-woods religious laundry woman. "Going 18", he begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing stones. The arrival of a dam building crew triggers dreams of romance in Mrs. Hepburn. Quickly attract the attention of the suave engineer Robert Young (in the role of John Stafford), who visibly hides his marital status. Supervisor engineer Ralph Bellamy (like George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to learn more about Jesus Christ, who worships Hepburn. <br /> <br /> After Hepburn uses the power of prayer to heal a child, people in the neighborhood suspect that she is a witch. <br /> <br /> If it weren't so serious, "Spitfire" could be more fun; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, which is not entirely convincing. Among the leads, Mr. Bellamy is the best. However, the best characterization is tested by Sarah Haden (in the role of Etta Dawson), who appeared in the theatrical version of George Cukor, along with Louis Mason (in the role of Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected ending helps.
