Simply put, this film has no substance. Take my word and save yourself when it is a complete DUD !! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional but that would imply that there was some sort of character development. I thought Eric Roberts would jump out at any moment that he was so close to B-Movie status. <br /> <br /> The girl from the 70s is beautiful ... but unless you are a stalker fan, this movie has nothing for anyone. <br /> <br /> Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie went straight to the DVD for a reason ... that ... is a train accident !!!
