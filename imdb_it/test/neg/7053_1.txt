The film should have ended as soon as the joke about the Bebe's Kids was told in the opening. I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but the really fun routines didn't have to be something the whole family could see. Find the point of one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and try to squeeze the joke as long as possible to turn it into a movie. This film had to be selfish because I can't find anyone who found the settings or the antics to be familiar. The funniest thing about this film is the choice by writers and producers to pass it off as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
