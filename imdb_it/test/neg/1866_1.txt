The only good thing about this movie is that they managed to tie it with the first part! But apart from that it was one of the worst movies ever! The only time you see the Ghoulies is in a flashback (and the flashback is just clip of the first part)! A must NOT see! From one to ten, "Ghoulies 4" gets one!
