It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing that can make the viewer of this film obnoxious is graphic violence. In fact, violence, both disturbing and comics, is the last of the profound defects of "Oldboy". The characters are one-dimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The "intensity", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served with the most economical means. Let's not confuse an irrational shot of adrenaline with artistic value. At the end of the film, it seems that all the papers were out of stock so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of "horror", to continue to "shock" an audience that is already numb from the plethora of stupid soap operas "revelations" already served in large decks. It would be hard to imagine that anyone has even vaguely become familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema fascinated by this pompous piece of garbage. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema: "Should I go in or should I buy five ice cream cones for the same money?" Be smart, Homer, go for the ice cream.
