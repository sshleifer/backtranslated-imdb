The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal is part of "My Giant" is to say that this film is for his career as "Ishtar" was for Warren Beaty - he didn't ruin it, but slowed it down ..... .. A lot. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play in front of a child 2) never play in front of an animal 3) never play with someone who is almost a meter high, he's innocent like a child and "acts" like an animal. <br /> <br /> What is this story? A comedy? I imagine, but I didn't laugh, except in the scenes in which Crystal is alone and is not burdened by his ex-wife (what is his role in the film) or by the aforementioned Gigante. Did I mention that there is also a child in this movie? Well, forget about him. The son gets involved to make us feel sorry for Crystal, and we do it, but for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, watch it in the old episodes of "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live". Rent "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally." <br /> <br /> "Giant" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum. <br /> <br />
