The director doesn't know what to do with a camera ... too many options and she always chooses the wrong one ... let her take charge ... and check the movie from beginning to end .. the characters are not developed ... maybe because we need to see them sing ... no rhythm, sometimes too fast sometimes too slow ... miscasted: travolta OK ... johansson, it's too grown to be an 18 ... even if she's really in 20 ... <br /> <br /> the happy ending? well, it seems like there must be one, so the plot is sad but not too sad ... Travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar but the director doesn't look at what matters too much which is totally out of sync ... <br /> < br /> the idea is the only thing that is great ... but how did it develop? well, it's just full of stereotypes and lines heard too often ... <br /> sin, another missed opportunity ...
