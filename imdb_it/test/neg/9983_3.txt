210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or so I feel) or the R-rated version released in cinemas? Both are terribly terrible, of course. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell have both claimed to wish they had never made this film (the last of the two men reported it in an interview with IMDb!), And I can see why. Nothing but an absurd mess of softcore porn and an unenthusiastic attempt at a plot. <br /> <br /> There isn't much of anything here, except for cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell himself said about the film: "It was like a moment I was staring at, admiring my mule or something, and the next scene would be two lesbians going there." <br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
