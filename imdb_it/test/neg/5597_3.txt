After seeing the film in my class and talking to the director, I discovered exactly why the film bombarded his way of doing things. The creators of the film had no intention of calling the film "8MM 2." Originally, the film was called "The Velvet Side of Hell" but was changed at the last minute by Sony Pictures in 8MM 2 without letting the directors have a say. In this way, he extrapolated them from theatrical releases and sentenced them to an immediate video release with minimal publicity. <br /> <br /> Once again, it's the filmmaker's mouth, not mine, so I can't really tell what the truth is and what is hype. <br /> <br /> If you watch the movie as "Velvet Side of Hell", it's not so bad. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It would basically be just a B-movie that likes to show tits. But as a sequel to "8MM", the film fails terribly.
