After reading the book, Heart of Darkness, the film didn't do it justice. The film embarrasses the book and anyone who has never seen the book would have disapproved of the plot and the plot because it has been described so badly by the film. In the film, the characters and the set were just some of the disappointments that occurred in the film. The director has left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made him one of the best literary works ever made. <br /> <br /> Obviously any book is better than the film, but these were not even comparable. Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in the vocabulary and intelligence of the written word. The film does not even begin to show any of this. Some of the very important and influential scenes in the book have been completely overlooked, such as when Kurtz was not in the boat when he died. Even when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtz's intent, he reacted differently in the film rather than in the book. Another important difference was that Marlow saw the image of the woman who was blindfolded at the end of the film, not at the beginning, like the book. This was influential in how the audience perceived Marlow, and the film completely messed it up. <br /> <br /> The book was so well tuned about how each place looked, but the scenario in the film was disappointing. There was a bunch of fake cheese backgrounds and compliments, a bunch of bad actors to get on with it. There was an exception for the terrible actors and that would be Isaach De Bankol√©, who played Mfumu. His character was represented the best. Although the film was not exceptional, I would recommend it ONLY if you read and understood the book very well. In this way, you can see what the differences are in the film and in the book and contemplate them. If you haven't read the book, I don't recommend the film because it's a boring and lifeless disaster. I loved the book, so you should definitely read it and enjoy it.
