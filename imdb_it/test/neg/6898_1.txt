BARNYARD sucked! I saw this movie last week and it's horrible. What bull has breasts? My 2-year-old girl asked me if all the cows have udders and try to explain to her that this is simply not true and to see the movie just confused her more! <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the violent theme scared my 2 years. They made the coyotes fierce and this instilled the fear of coyotes in my daughter. I know that coyotes are not fierce and natural predators. The mother and son who were sitting in front of us were shouting: "Kill him, kill him, yes" in a particular scene of the film where good against evil to say <br /> is a king of the king lion and should stop using big actors for a lame movie. Steve Oederek, who has also made films with thumbs, like Thumb Wars, Thumbelina and many others are so bad! <br /> <br /> If a good Steve Oederek movie ever comes out in my life, I'll turn around naked and swallow my diarrhea and post it on Youtube.com ... Stop Said!
