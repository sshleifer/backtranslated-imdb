This "fragment of space" was rather stupid. I guess it should have been an unexpected ending, but IMHO was just a big disappointment. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the terrestrial actors do a great job in this; their performances are not done justice with such a foolish end. How this ending could ever have passed any kind of review by the producers is beyond me. The other comment here is not correct, the language in which the cartoons came only during the second season, this thing had to be taken seriously! The producers and writers could have been a little more creative with the ending to do justice to the rest of the episode.
