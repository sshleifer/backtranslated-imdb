I can't express enough how bad this movie was. First of all what a waste of some legendary stars even if they are rather old and rather unconvincing. Fred Astaire, well, I think he should have been given a big favor as this was his last film role. The script is a disaster and the film looks terribly devastating. I imagine that maybe if I saw it when it came out (1981), I would have thought it was decent. However, seeing so many good horror movies, this was one of the worst. The only real convincing of anything in this mess was the very young and adorable type of creepy Alice Krige. The main young character was trying to do the best he could, but it was absolutely terrible. I wasn't sure how much it was due to his lack of skill or lack of an understandable script, but in both cases he was simply bad. Don't look if you don't want to see a bunch of old people get a little scared.
