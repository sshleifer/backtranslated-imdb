I saw this movie at midnight and I can say that it is worse than other horror films on a Haunted House. Alexandra Paul is not one of the best actresses but she can do the role better, The child gets worse this is an example of bad actress, she has no future in the big movie world. SENTENCE TO DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE: BAD
