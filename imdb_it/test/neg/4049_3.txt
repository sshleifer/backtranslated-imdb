Despite his ambitious ambitions, Zurlini's film must be seen as a failure. It is one thing to create a world that attracts the viewer to feel the boredom and the anguish experienced by the protagonist (which I think is what Zurlini was tempting). It's another thing entirely to make a film that is itself boring and without episodic meaning. Despite the beautiful cinematography in a disturbing place - and a wonderful soundtrack - the film never attracts the public. Too much is unintentionally funny (the fake sound of dripping water in Drago's quarters, for example, or the silent film that attacks some of the actors) or simply confusing (why does Drago want to leave the fort the first time?) For the film to be successful as a coherent job.
