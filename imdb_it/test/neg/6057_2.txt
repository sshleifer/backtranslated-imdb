This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've ever seen. It completely fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly twists and reducing the 12 jobs to ... 3 or 4, I think. It constitutes absolutely useless things to try to integrate other myths in awkward ways that question writers who have always read myths, how to change birds into harpies, lions into sphinxes, the Oracle of Delphi in Tiresias and the bulls into a pedant version of Proteus, also integrating aspects, never seen outside of the amusing series by Sam Raimi, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies, so it seems appropriate to the period. <br /> <br /> I could accept a lot of this, but I could completely fail in pure film standards; the most painful is the dialogue, the portentous pseudo-Shakespearean portentous and portentous. It is a poor reinterpretation of myths, making a sad attempt at a revision of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's "13th warrior" attempted concerning the Beowulf legend, while including strictly mythological elements such as the clear interference of super gods and magic -power. A sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience, which I'm sure many of the quality actors involved will regret deeply.
