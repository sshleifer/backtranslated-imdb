Sit in the basement with the light turned off for an hour and a half. It's almost like watching this underground quest for the Devil's door. An American researcher Owen (Vincent Gallo) goes to Moscow and gathers a rescue team to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzia), an archaeologist who died in the catacombs under the Russian capital. They will be shocked to discover the underground inhabitants who thrive in the dark and obscure system of caves and tunnels. The researchers will come across the guardian of hell, Andrey (Val Kilmer), and they will reach an agreement to continue their adventure; only to be able to be scared almost without spirit when they realize they died dead. Also in the cast: Joaquin de Almedia, Oksana Akinshina, Sage Stallone, Joss Ackland and Julio Perillan.
