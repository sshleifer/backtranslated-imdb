This film basically uses marital rape as one of its main comic devices. Now I've turned it off to the point where it literally ties it to the bed and violates it, but I can't really imagine how it was eventually turned into something engaging and fun. Not only did this film waste a wonderful cast and it was constantly not funny, but it actually managed to be rather brutally disturbing and misogynistic. How many people seem to find it a sweet family film is beyond me. "I enjoyed boxing those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it refers to forcing an unintended virgin to have sex with you in the hope that in the end she will learn to please him. Watching a peeping tom jerk off is not fun for the family. I honestly feel worse than having seen half of this disturbing "comedy" and I am totally baffled by these positive reviews.
