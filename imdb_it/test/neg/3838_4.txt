I thought Choke had potential, but I thought it could have been a much better movie. He had some interesting twists, but some of them seemed pretty useless. When it showed the background of the two main characters, some of these really seemed to go wrong. Most were useless and did not help the film at all. This was not Dennis Hopper's best time either. However, the main grace of this film for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. In this film, he almost makes Mr. Blonde look like a good guy. All in all, it was watchable. However, I was left thinking that some things could have been done differently. These things would have made the film much better, in my opinion.
