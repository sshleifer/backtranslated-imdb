I never wrote a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad that I had no choice but to warn you not to waste the two hours of your life. As an avid historian of the Second World War, I don't even know where to start on how historically inaccurate this film was. Carbines with bayonet fins from the Korean War, K98k cleaners and visors were missing, German uniforms that didn't exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it is full of flaws, it literally has no plot or climax, and acts on par with your local high school theater. The epitome of cheese. <br /> <br /> PLEASE ... there are too many good WWII movies out there to waste time on this junk.
