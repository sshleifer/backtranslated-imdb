This year I took part in a screening of "The Cooler" at the Toronto Film Festival. While the other reviews I've read seem to be generally (and mysteriously) positive, I have to tell you without any kind of ax to digest that this film is unimaginable, unspeakably bad. The bold and courageous interpretations of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been horribly unlucky in what is probably the least lucid and most banal script to have received the green light for years. I don't know how bad The Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure he couldn't reach the Dante-style depths that this one did. As brave as their performances were, perhaps the most courageous thing that these brilliant actors did was to rely on such a terrifying director and an abysmal script. <br /> <br /> It must go very well in the boardroom, because it should never have been allowed to be within 100 meters of a camera. The dialogue is so artificial and artificial that I found myself blushing during the screening. I am mortified that Macy's talents have been totally squandered in the hands of someone whose leadership is as incompetent as his writings. <br /> <br /> Watching gifted actors like Alec Baldwin work with Kramer's scary script and the direction of the ham fist. It was like watching a baby seal die to death - I felt angry, helpless and sick at the same time. Although I am always pleased that there are investors and people in the industry willing to risk eccentric scripts with interesting premises, this photo was a total total fiasco. Kramer could not have been more cruel to these actors if he himself took a steel pipe to his knees. I hope that for their own good they can avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely hid the side door and didn't even stop for the screening. Unfortunately, it seems that the protagonist's misfortune has erased the image in the worst possible way. Anyone accustomed to quality independents will probably find it completely unbearable.
