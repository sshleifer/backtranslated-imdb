This is a family movie set in rural America in the 1950s about a boy whose uncle presses the sheep to kill the charges against his dog Tamburo, starting not only a family feud but also discord in the community while their city begins to take sides. <br /> <br /> This is a formulated film that tries to be very touching and sweet. His biggest weakness is that the only people who could really act were Scott Bakula (Defender Lawyer), Ron Perlman (father / owner of Drum) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair", like uncle and his wife, were fine.) The kids weren't that good (they seemed to be acting in practice) and that's a problem when the movie it really runs around them (Aaron Fors, who plays the bully Donny makes me think of what actor Russell Crowe must have looked like when he was a child, only without talent but with a lot of ham). <br /> <br /> Preferred line (pronounced by the prosecutor after Scott Bakula's final defense speech): "We will be lucky if they do not launch us." <br /> <br /> Favorite line of Ron Perlman (after his son stabbed the bully): "Now make him your friend, it will be the difficult part." <br /> <br /> Pretty nice to rent / buy used.
