This little vicious film is horrendous. My low score is due to two main reasons. The first is that it is a film for animals and I find that the whole concept is so vile that my stomach turns. Shot over a hundred years ago, I can only hope that we have evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. This film is complete and completely exploited, designed to capture the sensational aspects of the film and the subject. Historical interest aside, this is something to look at only if you find yourself in the grip of morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> Reason number two? See how the camera is set up. It is in the best position possible to fully capture the effect: the elephant's long march forward, the perfect view of the electrocution platform and a cold and clinically dispassionate view of the elephant with the smoke coming out of it before it finally collapses. Sickening. <br /> <br /> Thomas Edison has done many great things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are not in doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this film has given A an opportunity for him to win the first film contestants with a sensationalist film of an electrocuted elephant and B) he has filmed the performance to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of DC in contrast to AC, you can't help but wonder if the scientist in him was a bit dispassionate and cold. Any number of Peter Cushing's mad scientists would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebel.
