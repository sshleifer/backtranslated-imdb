I saw this movie and I like horror movies. <br /> <br /> I didn't know what to expect, but as soon as the film was on its way, it was nice to watch it. The idea was quite original and the acting was nice. Especially Jenna Dewan as the exciting / diabolical Tamara. <br /> <br /> The hardest thing about horror movies is to have a good ending. But the film has failed. For a change, a final scene in a hospital, where suddenly all the employees left. First you see doctors and nurses running, but then they all went home? <br /> <br /> No cry for help while being chased by Tamara, Escaped to the roof (even a smart move ... no) and out of course a kind of open ending. <br /> <br /> No ... the movie started out great, the main part was nice to watch, but they really messed up the ending using all the clichés of the bad horror movies. Jeffrey Reddick has failed in my eyes with this film, having made some quality films like Final Destination 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If you like a good horror full of cliché endings, Tamara is a good movie from to watch. For me, I like films that surprise me.
