Looking and playing like cheap porn without sex, this is the first of an impressive series of producer smurfs (or in this case of the director) Geoffrey Reeve. <br /> <br /> And it's a doozy. Risibili at all levels. <br /> <br /> Some government agents (I believe) are "professionally murdered" in Amsterdam and an Interpol agent, much less charismatic than the wooden block (which I assure you is not called Louis Salinger) is sent to investigate wandering a lot to guarantee that the tax-dodger financiers get their money's worth for the plane tickets to be fired on the spot. <br /> <br /> The aspirant-hitting the attitudes towards drugs and the representation of prostitution must have seemed ridiculously outdated even before celluloid dried up, but the script is very useful because it explains exactly what happens regularly in a horribly invented direlogo ("Were you following? Oh no, of course not. No one outside Washington knows you are here!") And despite this the plot remains somewhat confused. The moment a sinister priest Vladimir Putin (no less than Kronsteen from Russia with love) drags himself to his pulpit to deliver a sermon that your brain has turned off, which is unfortunate because you will miss our hero - pinned to ground during a fight - struggling to reach a wooden board only to realize that he is actually sitting on a loaded gun, and he shouting "You bastaaaard!" to the murdered corpse of his friend, to the go-go boys bound with the skin, with the mustaches, the morris who dance and the exhilarating sequence of tortures - which provide all ample laughter. Only the boat chase impresses. It's an exciting and well-directed sequence that doesn't really have room in this movie. An obvious fault is explained when the credits come out - Reeve has nothing to do with that sequence! Fortunately everything returns to the usual business for the ridiculous sput-out-drink and warehouse twist. <br /> <br /> Unless there is such a poor thing as a suit by Geoffrey Reeve - and you are one of them - I wouldn't worry about this absurdity instantly forgettable.
