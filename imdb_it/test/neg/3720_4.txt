Mild and mild Edward G. Robinson (as Wilbert Winkle) decides to quit his job at the bank and does what he wants, open a "fix-it" repair shop behind his house. Mr. Robinson is married, but without children; he befriended the resident of the local orphanage Ted Donaldson (like Barry). Young Donaldson is a passionate laboratory assistant and sees Robinson as a father figure. Robinson's irritating wife, Ruth Warwick (as Amy) is dissatisfied with Robinson's job choice, and conspires to return her idea of ​​normality. Their lives are further upset when Robinson is drafted. <br /> <br /> The war also disrupts what may have been an interesting story, as the character of Robinson fights against a bully and nasty wife. Perhaps, the filmmakers are showing how war can save marriages and positively redirect lives. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has an uninteresting part. The final "trick" starring Ms. Warwick and Donaldson is predictably staged.
