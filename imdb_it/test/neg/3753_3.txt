Let's face it, this is a bad movie. However, if you go to make fun of it, you can survive the experience. Ok, you'll scream in agony a lot. Fun in the African jungle in a spicy way. <br /> <br /> Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing a funky hat) uses the local sorcerer and mad science to create a "perfect" being. He looks like a varmint who has been in a drunken week and is in a sack suit. You are very kind. But he won't kill for him because he's using a good girl as a subject. He needs a bad girl. <br /> <br /> Marla English and Lance Fuller are two little crooks looking for African gold. The training classes for Ms English should have been at the top of the search list. She is a bad girl and allows everyone to meet her in a performance worthy of a school play. Mike "Touch" "Connors is the white English guide and Fuller to lead the expedition. <br /> <br /> English & Conway finally meet and it's a game made in hell, it's the perfect subject for his creature voodoo because he will do anything (stress of anything) to get what he wants.You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this point. <br /> <br /> What made this film interesting for me was Conway who wore that hat / tribal headdress / funky floral piece! Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was. I think he thought that if he lowered it low enough on the eyes nobody would recognize him. <br /> <br /> Really a bad cinema.
