The final voice of the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual losers go around their business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could have gone on, but Harold Pinter complained that the scripts made him look bad by comparison, and so no others were made. <br /> <br /> Actually less than two minutes before getting our first extravagant sexism - a woman running for the bus finds the breast coming off the dress for no reason. However, at least make Stan (Reg Varney) laugh - but then what is not? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the whole film laughing out loud with little or no provocation. You have the impression that they are wet looking at the dried paint. <br /> <br /> As before, the only funny thing is the genuinely funny Stephen Lewis, exhilarating as Blakey. He's alone, though, with a dated and poor script that also wastes top-notch talent like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. Yet it seems that Lewis only understands how to time the rickety material, snatching laughter even at the weakest wrinkles. Describing how his daughter fell into a river, Stan's mother complains: "I hope she's not polluted." "Well, it will be now," jokes Blakey. <br /> <br /> The plot - if there really is one - sees Stan wanting a young girl, but being continually hindered by his overbearing mother. It's a recipe for hilarity that smashes the side I'm sure you'll agree, and whether it's a storm-beaten boat or a swimming pool, Stan and Mavis's businesses always produce the same result ... boredom abject. Successive achievements include Maria, an Italian stereotype and a collaborator of the staff. Even Stan's mom receives a one-night concert, with Stan reminding her to "put the tin drawers". <br /> <br /> When one of the "highlights" of the comic is Arthur Mullard listening to Olivo trying to locate a light switch to the dark ("I can't find it") and thinking he's talking about sex, then you can understand because this work reaches the higher levels of literary sophistication. In fact, the reason why he didn't enter the first 100 BFI films is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Other tickling-rebel shenanigans involve Olive (Anna Karen) breaking glasses. I don't know what is more surprising, the bad predictability of the set-up or the underdeveloped pay-off. The shortsighted Olive follows a man with a kilt in men, thinking he is a woman with a skirt. The next blow sees her marched by Blakey and redirected to the ladies. And this is all. Later, he ends up in another man's bed and is ordered by his wife. And ... no, that's all there is in that scene. <br /> <br /> When Holiday on the Buses was last shown on British television, a transmission failure occurred. It actually came as a blessed relief.
