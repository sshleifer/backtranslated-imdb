I have just seen Icon on DVD and despite being a great book, the film is a weak substrate. Those responsible for writing should be banned in Siberia. Because they transform the big story with all kinds of C-film subtitles that are totally irrelevant to the story it's totally beyond me. <br /> <br /> Yet the directors and the cast do their best to create something, but in the end the film was not at all satisfying. <br /> <br /> Can anyone please make a decent movie about this to show how it's done. I'm sure the crowd will gather for a novel so big that it becomes a book, not an economic film.
