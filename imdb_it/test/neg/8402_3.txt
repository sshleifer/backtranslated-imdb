I have heard that Novo has been compared to Memento for the simple fact that both are based on main characters who suffer from short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as they both involved a character that killed more people. They could not be more distant in ideas. <br /> <br /> Novo takes care of a photocopier man in a company that has a short-term memory loss. He is constantly followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes a temperature that lets itself be involved and can / cannot use it for sex. Needless to say, he has a lot of sex on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wait, there's more. There is a boy who runs into tormented amnesia and it is obvious that there is more to this boy who is hitting him. And there is a notebook that the man continues to try to remember important clues. I admit that they are not for films made abroad. I don't care to read the subtitles, but I think that sometimes this takes away one of my favorite aspects of a film: a great dialogue. Since they have to translate, or I wouldn't be able to understand for the most part, I really believe they simplify what the characters have to say. This film was no exception; the dialogue was just, well, blah. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was quite interesting to keep me around for 98 minutes. Strange, yes, but then again I don't live in France, so I'm not so familiar with their likes / dislikes or lifestyles. (For example, I suppose it is acceptable for a father to lie and have fun in the buff with his son on the beach which must be a cultural thing.) Fortunately, it was not two hours + of time spent watching this man regain his past and progressively go on for his care. Why, when the "secret" is learned, I was like, really? Well, okay. <br /> <br /> I can only advise you for decent acting, good-looking people and soft-porn sexual situations (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you're not in that kind of scene, I'll skip all heart this slow movie that recovers memory.
