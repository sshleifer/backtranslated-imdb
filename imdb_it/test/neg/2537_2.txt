The legendary Arizal Abysmal Indonesian action movie triumphantly sculpts a model for the future of Cinemax as "China O'Brien" and "Do or Die" with Erik Estrada and simultaneously buries the poor action star Pat O'Brien with a backyard script and three cans of hairstyles gel to allow his impressive 1984 strain. This guy's physical prowess resembles a more feminine Mark Gregory and his next credit would be Chris Mitchum's second violin as "Tom Selick". Powerful. At least the action is unreasonable and non-stop with some bold Asian stuntmen who risk their lives for what is essentially a movie badly constructed by teenagers and / or drug addicts without any concept of reality. A poor extra is shredded by an electric hedge trimmer and many others are shot in the head with odd objects such as motorcycle wheels or cardboard boxes. The classic rape scenes are tasteless dialogues, priceless and quotable as "I'd rather trust a rattlesnake!" they are delivered with such exuberance and fervor by the third-class police officers. Random highlighting: a crazy guy who eats real lizards. The film also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10
