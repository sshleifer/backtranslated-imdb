"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" has always been filmed as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it rather disappointing. The main actors are fantastic - Terence Stamp is aging beautifully, Guy Pearce should make more comedies instead of the gloomy roles he chooses and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play Oberon eons ago. Cinematography is fantastic, but if you've ever been to the Australian outback, you would know that the air is so clear and the light so bright that it can be filmed in the cinematic equivalent of a Box Brownie and would still have looked spectacular. <br /> <br /> So what's my problem? Well, three things. First of all, there is no feminine character in the whole film. A woman who has to make a living shooting ping pong balls from her friends in a pub along the way deserves our solidarity. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scene in which "I Will Survive" sing to an Aboriginal group is offensive. To try to draw any parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trans and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture, which is what I presume the scene should do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton. /> <br /> Finally, and the biggest flaw in the film is that it's not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott really talk to any drag queens during the film? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have a rapier spirit and are not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drag queen jokes would probably have allowed the film to reject the classification, but Elliott should have been able to collect enough "child-friendly" material to complete his film. <br /> <br /> So all in all, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.
