First of all, I would like to mention the fact that, despite the title («Stories», in the plural), there is only ONE history of cooking. As for whether Isak died or not at the end, I'm not so sure since, in one of the last scenes, HIS PIPE is seen on the table next to the two cups. On the cover of the DVD there is a reference to Tati. He says that the film is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: remember Tati!". The great Jacques Tati was based mainly on mimicry and on the silent and impassive attitude to get his comic effects and offer his opinions critically satirical about his "modern" French society of the 50s Naturally, "Kitchen" takes place in the 50s and offers some (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments in which they were not pronounced words - but they are not really funny, all these little details are enough to make «cuisine» a «tatiesque» film? Having said that, I must admit that «Kitchen» deals with the false objectivity of scientific research with respect to the «truth» of emotions human subjective. In general, the film was incredibly slow, with nothing happening - with almost no "dramatic impulse": the engaging parts were set up during the first 15 minutes or so, and during the last For an hour or so. In fact, the last segment was - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It might seem that it was a short topic, less than an hour, unduly extended for about 90 minutes. Now, on the set-up (a "scientific" observation on the behavior of single males in their kitchen): at first it seemed very promising - with the creation of charts of bachelor and comings in their kitchen as a means of determining what new inventions would be more useful to invent. But very soon this premise turned out to be just a prologue, an "excuse" to introduce the real topic that was only fully developed towards the end and that concerned solitude and the inestimable bond of friendship. Have pity! I really wanted to like that movie. Yes, it seemed so promising when I heard about some of his unusual anecdotes - which were really there and that I liked - like the burning of a man's nose (instead of using scissors to cut it), the "investment" of having an enormous amount of "precious" black pepper piled up in a barn, the role of inversion (the observant who becomes the observed), the mouth of a man who makes sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse that becomes the catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of driving by right or left in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance for each of these very close countries to affirm his individuality?). Am I the only person who has not fully enjoyed that movie? Does this necessarily mean I'm wrong? Perhaps it is almost generally praised "the fine points" were, in fact, "too thin" for me? Perhaps ... My individual points of view on this film ironically reflect the very essence of the film - what would be the vital need to have the right to differentiate, to affirm one's individuality and not to blindly follow the trends and opinions of the society? Each of us has the right to have different personal points of view and not to be a slave to the demands of our "dictatorial claim": we often have other alternatives that would allow each of us to be useful to our society while respecting our inner principles. In short, being true to oneself - the way in which Folke (Isak's "scientific observer") ends up quitting his job in that movie, preferring to stay in his new friend Isak's house and help him do his homework farm ... And so, "Vive la différence", as the French say!
