This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian doctor does not contain many conflicts, since it is largely westernized (after having studied in London), nor fireworks, since it behaves in a rather sober way. The little interest that history manages to raise is further downed by their wooden dialogues. They should be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but talk as if the words were put in the mouth by a Hollywood hack that is not much of itself. The film also suffers from an incredible lack of realism: a completely deserted beach in the crowded small Hongkong, invaded by a million Chinese refugees? And an alleged 40-year-old American journalist who doesn't know what hysterectomy is? Hollywood Ideas Finally "the song". After listening to him for an estimated twenty times in the film, starting with the credits, he tends to lose some of his emotional impact, I regret to say.
