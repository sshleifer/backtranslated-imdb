A ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent his action against them. Interesting premise could make a good film, but this is only lame and far-fetched. Boring with an embarrassing ending, to say the least. Mrs. Mirren tries to give a little dignity to this lack of ignition, but she too - a good actress, no doubt - could save this garbage. I give this a 4 (four).
