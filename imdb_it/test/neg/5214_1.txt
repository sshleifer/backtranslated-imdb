(Chances are, I'm going to ruin valuable value points as I write this and why I can't determine and I don't really care what you think is a valuable value point, so if you're thinking about watching this movie and having a problem with the learning these things, so I suggest you go directly to the next review.) You know, I don't care that cult movies are stored in the "cult" section. And the people who believe that they can go there and fill themselves with "reality". I mean, is it too much to ask that openly pseudo-Christian propaganda films be archived with other Special Interest films? <br /> <br /> I couldn't have been more stunned if Pat Robertson had made a porn movie. (or would it be "flubbergasted"?) <br /> <br /> It was bad enough that there was a very poor number of kicks and punches in this one. It was bad enough that the same story had been repeatedly repeated in much better ways. It was bad enough that it wasn't presented under Special Interest, with other cult films. It was bad enough that somehow he is receiving hints to be "realistic" as if we lived in the world where cities are possessed by the "debbil" and the really deep and bad evil is NOT done by human beings - usually in the NAME of religions based on the god of Abraham. It was bad enough to just have to shut it down because people complained so loudly that it was horrible. No, the really BAD part was when one of our guests got up after finally having to turn off the damn thing and declare "I for one would like to see something really violent or pornographic now, just to get it out of my mind. Preferably both 'you have." And we had just met her.
