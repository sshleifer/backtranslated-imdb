Since I am obliged to write at least 10 lines, and this garbage deserves not only a single one, I will start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this terrible so-called "film". <br /> <br /> 2. Allow me to explain why these turkeys that David Varod produces are mainly shot in my beautiful homeland, Bulgaria (BTW only, for illiterate people around - this country is IN EUROPE, based in northern Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) A few years ago, NU Image invaded our country and started producing mostly direct-to-video crap. Why here? Because here they pay negligible taxes to the Bulgarian crew and Bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished) who are, in many ways, better than most of their American counterparts. Personally I am ashamed of this fact. The reason is, of course, the greed of the Americans involved and their desire to get the most, if not all the profit. In reality it would not be so bad if only the production was not so dirty and pale. There hasn't been a nice picture taken here for years. Currently the image of NU is sued precisely for the highly questionable purchase of our national film production center called Boyana Films. There is no doubt that there was corruption, that there was a deception, that there were lies in this recent purchase. Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live Bulgarian cinema!
