The only reason I didn't delete this movie after 20 minutes is because we've already wasted 20 minutes ... <br /> <br /> the one and only thing I repeat is that the only effect they used is a strange kapoera (from India?) Jump on a wall half a meter / garbage cans, I mean, the effects don't make a film but ... sheesh .... my friend and I hoped that the whole movie had some real effect (a huge wolf?! something!?>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo ... all we have is a jump! on a wall of 0.5 meters + they used the pharmacy ..... and found the guns?! in the pharmacy ?! I mean, what the hell? oh I forgot, there was another effect: the spears in contact like green eyes! every 10 minutes we shouted "the only thing that can save the film from shame is a giant wolf that kills them all !!! in addition to what the script was so terrible that you don't know who you'd like to die first. actually pray (and I mean PRAY!) that the "good?!" will die, hopefully in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters to remove the film from all the archives of the world.
