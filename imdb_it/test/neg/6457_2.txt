Talk about false advertising! What was he doing this in the comic section of my video rental? I think there was perhaps a laughable part in the film. I can appreciate the black comedy, but this was just darkness without any comedy. The film was generally disturbing and not very funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was as good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was good too, but in general the movie is falling apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so much. Even the ending was disappointing. What would be Buddy's motivation to let Guy manage to get away with what he did? This is not really explained to everyone. Why should Buddy make such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy fucked Guy completely by passing him off to the police? The ending doesn't seem to make much sense to me, no matter how I looked. <br /> <br /> In general, I did not like the film despite good acting. Spacey essentially chews the scenario for most of the film, but towards the end he gives Buddy some necessary humanity. The story was not as good as the cast.
