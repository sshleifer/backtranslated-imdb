Red glasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has made wonderful demented visions of the future. However, this film was a boring pretentious shit. The opening scene has shown great promise for what the cover and description promise a surreal future live action amimae style noir. I feel I took it with Avalon. <br /> <br /> With Red Spectacles I was just pushed to feel uneasy about wishing the hell was the point. The film barely made sense to me and I didn't care much about the people there. This would all be ok if the film were effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting and the scene with the giant robotic suit that held the giant machine gun in the rain seemed cold, he didn't watch the movie that deserved to be watched. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down.
