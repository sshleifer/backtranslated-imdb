After watching this for 15 minutes I knew how it would end. It is a clich√© film with a stupid configuration. I'm a big fan of thieves movies, but this doesn't offer anything smart or special again. It is a theft of an insider that went wrong because "hot head-bad guy" shoots a bum, and obviously "do goody-bad guy" makes a moral journey. The reason it is stupid and not credible is. When you've already gone so far to kill a bum, why not just kill the guy who stands between you and 43 million. They had 45 minutes to put aside money and stage a robbery no one in there, the mind hesitated to shoot Mr "do well" and in this case is a boy they had known for a few days ... half, but I have a duet and boy do I regret it
