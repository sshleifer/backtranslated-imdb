How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of glasses with thick black frames and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I don't see how this guy continues to get paid to make this tripe. How can Lynch frame the film left over from a failed TV pilot into a senseless, shameless mess and have enthusiastic critics and actually include it in the best years? <br /> <br /> I'm baffled. If you are looking for a good film noir, rent "Bound". If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie try "Memento". But watch out for this overcrowded smell unless your idea of ​​a night of fun is throwing away 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard earned money.
