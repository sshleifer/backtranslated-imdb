This film is probably the worst movie I've seen in a long time. The acting is so wooden that a door could have done a better job. The plot is ridiculous and superficial and the true "rugby" shown is far from reality. I still can't get the "haka" as interpreted in this poor entertainment excuse. I am not a Kiwi, but I know that the Haka can only be interpreted by someone of Maori origin and not by a white American boy. <br /> <br /> I suppose it was made for the American public so the superficiality and "Disney end" are excusable, but there was almost no attempt to indicate the basic rules of the game, apart from the side of the prison where the main character suddenly takes charge of a football game and instead brings everyone to play rugby. The only good thing about this film was the end credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into the eyeballs.
