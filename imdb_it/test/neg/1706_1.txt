This is a film that revolves around two mysteries (which I have now demystified). <br /> <br /> First, did the filmmakers understand the concept of "parody" before using it to bomb the public throughout the film? The parody is when a reproduction attempts to mock, comment or pay homage with self-deprecating humor to the original work. In other words, there should be reasons to parody this kind of work, and they should definitely be smart. I didn't see any of those in the movie. I saw some horrible 10 second jokes that fell flat within 2 seconds of delivery. Bryan Stoller probably went to Eric Roberts and said "Hey, I was drunk last night, watching the Survivors, and I got this brain fart for a direct DVD release. I want you on board without reading the script ... because I'm going to direct this film without one! "<br /> <br /> And here is the second mystery: the career of Eric Robert. I think Eric Roberts had the career he had because he was unlucky. Now I understand that he is stupid (and therefore deserves the career he had). After seeing this film, it is clear that it would have been better if he had entered the mainstream adult movies, which has higher budgets, more ... intense ... scenes and roles, better acting and directing, more elaborate and compelling story lines and a much wider audience than this rejection of the B-movie (C-movie?).
