This is the kind of film that is loved by teachers and 50-year-olds who consider themselves aware of social problems - but in reality they have no idea. The actors - I think they are all amateurs - do their best, but the script is so full of clich√©s and stupidity that they can't save it. <br /> <br /> Worst of all though is the scool cabaret that the kids are working on - it brings back all your worst memories from acting lessons at school. The text of one of the songs is something similar in a quick translation at 2.30am: "I am the dwarf of society, an emotionally paralyzed individual." <br /> <br /> Please!
