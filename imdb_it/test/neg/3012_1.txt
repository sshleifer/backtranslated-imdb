This show is pathetic. I can't even imagine how someone with a larger IQ than a can of split pea soup that has passed its expiration date can sit voluntarily in this garbage for an entire half hour. It is one of those rare shows that is so terribly terrible from every point of view that you can honestly say that you are less intelligent simply by looking at it. I conducted a study and discovered that the average person loses 10 IQ points every fifteen seconds watching this show. This is second only to another abortion Comedy Network, Popcultured (19.863.221 points IQ per second lost) and practically a draw with Girls Will Be Girls. The VIP keys owe all excuses to each of us. Every time I watch this parody of a show, I feel sad for the company. How is it allowed to continue?
