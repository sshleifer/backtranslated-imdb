This is truly one of the worst films ever made - and I don't mean it in such a bad way. Eddie Murphy is a great comic book, and is a testament to how ugly this movie has almost killed his career. Writing and directing are inept, the sets and sets are as imaginative as an episode of Brady Bunch, and the acting shows how bad an exceptional cast can be when they have absolutely nothing to work with. If it weren't for the costumes - which, apart from Eddie Murphy's ego, seem to account for most of the budget - I would swear this was slapped by a bunch of high schoolers wasted on Schnapps peppermint. That anyone can find this parody in any funny or amusing way is mind-boggling. It is probably no coincidence that the misguided souls who are praising this stinker are barely educated. But if your idea of ​​hilarity is Della Reese's that makes her "little finger" disappear, then put your drool aside and go and rent this movie.
