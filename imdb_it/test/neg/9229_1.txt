Yes, it's me again! Mr 'I sit shit so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> What do you think of this? Could it be perhaps a woman who calls a sex line and arranges to meet bachelors in an isolated area? Then his disguised boyfriend arrives and cuts his throat with a razor before reassembling along with his money? Wow, what a hypothesis! And if I tell you that the policeman who was put on the case is forced to join a sexy role assistant to nail these aspirants, what conclusion will you come from? Do you think the sexy DA will go undercover wearing a flimsy red dress for an attempt to meet the drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and having to be rescued by the non-conformist officer? (who has already given his gun and badge) ZING! Get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Frankly, this film bored me to tears. Why do people insist on making this kind of garbage? It is a waste of our time, of their time, yet they still continue to film ... filming a film that nobody gives a crumb. If it has any saving features, there's the fact that it has some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in a movie for a while. I hope they spent the meager wages earned with plenty of botox and colonic irrigation. They look great on the Vogue cover, or perched on top of a bikini-clad car. They should leave acting to professionals (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Speaking of future careers, I met the director the other day. It is safe to prepare a tasty meal with chicken burgers. I must also say that the uniform does it really well. I asked him about "Party Line", and his eyes settled on the floor before muttering something about the extra chips. Oh well, I guess it didn't work. No matter, they're letting him take over the drive-thru tomorrow !! Hooray !! 1/10
