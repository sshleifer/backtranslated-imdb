Why, oh why, is this garbage considered a classic? I've seen more body titles on episodes of The Simpsons. Practically nothing happens in this film and much of the running time is full of almost unbearable melodrama from a cheap soap opera. <br /> <br /> The Trenton family is going through difficult times and when dad is out of mom and the kid goes to repair the car. But when they get to the ranch they find out that the watchdog has gone mad. The rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the St. Bernard jumper surrounds them again and again. <br /> <br /> As for the child, I have never seen a more annoying child in a movie in my life. And of course he's completely Aryan because children with blond hair and blue eyes, like the one featured on Kinder chocolate packets, are apparently more likeable than people with brown eyes and dark hair, like me. All he does is cry and complain. The same goes for the mother. He gets out of the car, gets into the car, gets out of the car, gets into the car. I know this was done in 1983, but I just killed horror movies in which the characters make silly and illogical decisions. If Mom had simply used common sense, she would have been able to escape from the icky dog. <br /> <br /> It is poorly written and there is no tension. If you want to see a good "bad dog" movie, check out John Lafia's best friend. It's fun, inventive, has a better dog, a higher number of bodies and a more engaging story. Let this sweeper be.
