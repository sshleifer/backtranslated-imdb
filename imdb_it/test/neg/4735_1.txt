If you are a fan of one of the two franchises of origin (Aliens & Predator ... duh ... and even if you liked or disliked AVP flick in 06) you would hate this movie. The innumerable holes in the plot, extravagant and incredible human characters, terrible special effects and even worse combat and combat scenes make this the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> *** SPOLIER *** One of the Shipyards huge holes in the plot included the hybrid Pred / Alien that went from the chest to the full ass in a few seconds (takes off on a predator ship of kills of Predator and wipes out a Preds ship before the ship breaks the Earth) orbit.) AS IF. In the first AvP we saw a hunt ship of Sr. Predator release three young hunters who were going to a hunting party to "earn their stripes", and finally saw them picking up the "honored body" of the young man who had remained at the end of the blow. Did we expect that we believed that the only hybrid blast of the chest killed all these Sr. Hunters before the ship broke into orbit? Furthermore, (and this was EXTREMELY value of economic production on the parts of the director / producer) jars, cans and jars of face-huggers magically appeared aboard the Pred ship, even though the entire temple complex and Queen Alien had been destroyed in the movie AvP. These face-huggers end up playing an inevitable part in the movie ... obviously. And what about all these troublemakers who become adult Aliens in one day? What a joke. Although there were many other holes in the plot, I don't think IMDb would appreciate that I filled their servers by writing them here. <br /> <br /> On the flakey and incredible characters, well, where should I go boys and girls? Where to start ... almost all of these goof balls are common people in other movies or TV shows. The bad boy from the city who left to avoid jail but shows up just on the day when everything happens to save the day ??? Where did I see it? Oh yes, last season on JERICHO !!! Then there is the 20-year-old sheriff (a former engineer) who was once the best friend with the bad boy. Where did we see it? Oh yes, JERICHO and Walking Tall! Then there is the generic soldier (WITH NO RANK) who returns home to a generic war front that is not met as a beloved long lost and a hero at the airport or bus station, but at his front door from her daughter and husband. And who is this soldier? What did you do in the army / aeronautics / marine / navy / coast guard? WE DON'T KNOW why the film NEVER SAYS IT. But ... dunh, dunh, dunh ... she was a kind of soldier / aviator / sailor / sailor / coast who knows how to drive a Stryker infantry vehicle and ... magically ... A HELICOPTER !!! This character is just a generic copy of every person in the "homecoming" service ... except that he brings home a set of night vision goggles to his daughter that cost several hundred dollars. These are things that soldiers must sign and not just "take home". UGH! <br /> <br /> Special effects and combat scenes are what get me through the worst. These are the things I liked best in the first movie ... watching Preds and Aliens go to this one! The way this was shot, however, the action sequences were so dark and filmed so closely that you couldn't know what was happening. You couldn't see who was doing what and what was happening while they were fighting. All in all, these hundreds of articles will kill this franchise and the fans. Nobody will be interested in seeing their favorite science fiction movie monsters anymore, and can only imagine that the series will come down from here, as producers will not like to download millions of dollars in a sequel.
