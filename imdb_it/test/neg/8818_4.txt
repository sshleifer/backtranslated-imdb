I have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things. <br /> <br /> 1. What I will call the "stupid victim syndrome". If you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun, shoot him please. If you're a cop and you have your gun pointed at the killer - please shoot it. <br /> <br /> 2. When you are in a high stress situation and have your finger on the trigger of a gun - your first instinct is to squeeze. This is one of the first things they teach you in gun training and why you don't put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to shoot - ask any hunter or infantry soldier. If you are electrocuted, your muscles should contract - making you pinch your finger. <br /> <br /> 3. It is really difficult to lie on the completely still floor for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - without noticing that you are not dead. Even more if it is supposed to die of a brain tumor and he was in the hospital only a few months before. <br /> <br /> 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - the boy who injected the poison he had to take the antidote. If you poison someone, it's murder. <br /> <br /> 5. What was Adam's lesson that he should have learned? Yes, the doctor had to be present, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> Besides these things, I would have given this film a higher grade. The plot was pretty good, and the way the killer chose to kill his victims was very creative. I can even forgive the doctor's terrible acting - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick. The cinematography and the soundtrack were very good, but the ending seemed artificial and didn't work for me. Thank God I didn't have to pay to see this or I would have asked for a refund.
