This film is not funny at all, and I guess I'm pretty offensive to the Jews. (and I'm not Jewish) Why? First, the entire film portrays the protagonist Zucker as a lier / cheater who does business and shady deals, while his son is gay, his daughter is a lesbian and his niece is a bitch. Then there is the incestuous relationship that happens in the family, first her daughter with her Joshua and Jana, and then her son with her niece. Two incestuous relationships in the family. I'm surprised they didn't add the plot to have a mentally disabled person in the family ... Now, that would really complete the Nazi sub-human ideal! (gays, lesbians, Jews ...) <br /> <br /> Totally disgusting movie. I am surprised that this film has no response from any Jewish community.
