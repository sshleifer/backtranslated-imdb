If I could give this film a negative rating, I'd do it. Humor is the crudest I've ever seen in a movie. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly without their fault. There are 2 charts, none of which support half a movie. Where is the "depth" that others see in this film? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film starts well and black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and the convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more terrifying. If you think the 3 Stooges are too cute with each other, if watching the beheading of a victim kidnapped with a Bowie knife is a real slap in the thigh, if you thought "Schindler's List" was hilarious, then this movie does for you.
