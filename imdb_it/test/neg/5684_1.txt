I watched the first 10 minutes and was bored to death. So, I proceed quickly to the end. This film must be the worst of all in the low-budget science fiction category so far. Bad acting, cast, directions, personalized Lara Craft imitation, story, plot, everything! Through the whole movie, I think there are only 6-7 people in the entire cast, but ONLY two of them started in the whole movie. I was expecting something like the enemy ship, but there was nothing like it. I was deceived by the title of the film and the image on the DVD cover. Don't waste time watching this boring and ugly movie. Come to think of it, I wonder why did they take the trouble to publish bad movies like this?
