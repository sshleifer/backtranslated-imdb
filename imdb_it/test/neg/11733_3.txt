Honestly, how difficult can it be to make a good remake? Obviously quite difficult! I was so excited to see it because I loved the original, and my friends go to see it and they tell me that it really sucks. Well, I finally see it and I was sooo disappointed. Okay, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave a 3. Otherwise, it sucked. Vince Vaughn does a terrible job playing Norman, it's too thick or something. I don't know, it was just terrible. Don't see it!
