I was amazed by the director Antal, Kontroll, in 2003. His first American project, Vacancy, was less impressive but a decent start. Armored is his second feature film and while the visual signature is recognizable, the film never rises above the level of a movie B. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for the shots of stage and the ensemble cast with many quality actors should be able to provide. Antal could have made a great robbery film, but instead opted for an action movie. Then again he could have made a good action movie, but actually not even in that department. <br /> <br /> What you have left is an implausible situation after another, a group of poorly designed characters arguing and fighting for a sum of money. If you look beyond the clear cinematography, the cast and the narrow soundtrack, you have what might have been a direct-to-below-average video with Van Damme or Seagal. <br /> <br /> This has probably been the most disappointing film for me for a long time.
