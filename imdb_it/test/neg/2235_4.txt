First, he produced this film. It has the feeling of subsequent films with international casts that are nicknamed. The headlines tell us that it was shot in Vienna. <br /> <br /> Bey was a pleasure in the universal adventure films of the 1940s. He was also superb in a film I saw maybe ten years ago, but I've never heard of since: "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as an electrifying and scary movie. <br /> <br /> This is rather wooden, unfortunately. The plot is not easy to follow. When I understood correctly, I was still disappointed. <br /> <br /> Francis Lederer is an excellent pianist. He was a very handsome man ten or fifteen years ago. He never became an important star, even though he should have. <br /> <br /> It's not terrible, but it's pretty heavy.
