With its few touches of surrealism, LWHTRB works as a low-level horror, but as an important statement of follow-up to the original, it rages miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start somehow promising during the opening titles of the show. Let's see and hear different shots and interesting sounds: the black cradle of the child with the overhanging cross, inverted; the Rosemary kitchen knife carried into Castevette's apartment and fell into a state of shock (the tool was shown off the wooden floor); and the emptiness of the Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (the off-screen voices can be heard here from the dialogue of the previous film). Also interesting is the Easter egg hunt in which the titular child participates (even eggs and baskets are black). Once the story moves, it never really gives up ... And what happens to Rosemary when she gets on that bus without a driver, and gets taken away from God knows where? <br /> <br /> Patty Duke (a poor substitute for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (like the southwestern whore who raises the child, "Adrian / Andrew") direct this star-like cast, with Ruth Gordon taking up her role as "Minnie". <br /> <br /> Although not a total failure, this sequel of sorts should have been published first in a book, so maybe we could all have been a little better informed ... and not left totally in the dark. A fairly recent sequel novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is the legitimate sequel to Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
