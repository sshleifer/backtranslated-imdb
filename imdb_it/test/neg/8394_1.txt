When my GF and I went to see this movie, we didn't know what to expect, but he assured me he had good reviews. So I got along. We entered the cinema and bought tickets and went to the screen. After a while sitting there waiting for the film to start, no one else has stepped through the door. I was very suspicious because usually you get at least a couple of people in a cinema show. The film started at the end and we sat there. After a bit of dialogues and moody scenes that were very "artistic", I was starting to understand why we were the only people there. He was disjointed with casual cuts from the main story to children in a skate park, the story doesn't make sense. The child should have committed a crime when he didn't and if he did, writing a letter to no one is not an answer and you shouldn't feel guilty just because you wrote that letter, you should have been punished. There was really no sense in this movie. I have no idea why we didn't go back to get our money back in the whole movie. I tried to give him a chance, I guess. There was little concept for this film, and the performance was shameful. The writer and director and almost everyone else who made this film should have figured out what they were doing and stopped. It is an hour more than I will never return. I'm sorry for everyone who liked this movie, but ... it's so terrible, I mean really really bad. Oh well, at least I never have to be subjected to it again.
