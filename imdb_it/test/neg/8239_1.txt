As I sat watching this episode, I kept looking at the clock waiting for something to happen. At the time of the hour I thought that they would really give us a big pop at the end, and then ... nothing. The whole family is curled up around the Christmas tree like something from the Hallmark Channel, then fades into black. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the finest season fines I've ever seen. Not at all to whet the excitement for next season. The only thing thrown out as a kind of incentive to watch next season was the ambiguous nugget offered by Agent Harris while making a sandwich sandwich that the New York boys were trying to get one of the boys in New Jersey. Wow really? I would never expect anything like this from the mobsters, I'm on the edge of my seat. It almost seems like they're trying to make everyone lose interest. More plot lines begin to end up disappearing than any show I've ever seen. They are teasing and suggesting, but they rarely offer more. <br /> <br /> What do the Arabs who frequent the Bing have? They keep throwing them in front of us and magically, nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Paulie knees a baby after Tony promised his mother that nothing would happen to his son and, after all, went to the wind. /> <br /> And how many other meandering drug montages with Christopher we will have to endure? Please get him arrests or overdoses or something interesting. <br /> <br /> This was one of the few shows I couldn't wait to watch but now, forgive me.
