The first 10 minutes of the movie make fun of sequels and pg-13 movies. These are the 2 reasons why the film is so ugly. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo" which is the film-in-a-film version of shorty. Whenever they do, you will be very angry. Travolta is not very nice, not even Keitel. However, The Rock and Vince Vaughn are fun. They are not the kind of fun you would expect to see in an Elmore Leonard movie. If you haven't seen shorty, you'll probably like to be cool. If you enjoyed having some time, you will leave the theater to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
