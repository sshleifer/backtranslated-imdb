I watched this movie (film?) randomly and I never stopped watching because it's so ridiculous that any dog ​​can interpret this act and it will be better than the actors (actors?) of this bad remake of Fatal Attraction that there is no directing , don't play, just an unlucky copy of Adrian Lyne's film if you have doubts about suicide, look at this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I can't imagine the people who went to the cinema to see this garbage; maybe someone who has had an empty afternoon and chooses the first cinema near home to stay 2 hours with others to forget the problems but it's difficult to go home relaxed
