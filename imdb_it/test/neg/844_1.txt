A terrible parody of Greek resistance. Senorita Cruz is misplaced as a Greek girl from Kefalonia (there are many beautiful English actresses who speak English, so why choose a Spanish lady for one of the main roles and with an English actor like her father, presumably a Greek doctor!? Of the cast of support are well-known actors and actresses from the Greek theater and TV series. The only foreign actor, as far as I know, who played a Greek successfully was Anthony Quinn (as the lignite Macedonian miner Zorba in the Greek Zorba, as the plutocratic shipowner in the Greek magnate and Greek colonel in the guns of Navarone. <br /> <br /> There is some historical truth reflected in the film. The people who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were not strict, unlike of the Germans who succeeded them. Even Mussolini's forces, as mentioned in the film, had been defeated by the Greek army in the Albanian countryside. After the Germans intervened in the Balcan The Italian militia ry was allowed to occupy parts of Greece, hence the local government's refusal to surrender to Italian forces, rather than to the Germans. as interpreted in the film it is quite plausible, although I am not sure that this actually happened.
