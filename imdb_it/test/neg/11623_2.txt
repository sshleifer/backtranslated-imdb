the worst sequel I've ever seen. really horrible songs that are shocking considering how fantastic the first films and the story are! furthermore, what ruins the film for me is the fact that there is no John Cleese, so jean bob may not even be there and the new villains are terrible. it's really annoying how that old woman-like thing can't put together a simple phrase together without repeating her words over and over and over and over again. but to be honest, Uberta is not a little closed. but the fact that it was his fiftieth birthday: why do they design it as an age of 80? I was going to give it a 1 but now I think ... I could give it a 2. but the plot isn't as close as the first movie. it is similar without the humor of certain characters. Overall I didn't like this movie entirely because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of vocal talent: having changed the voice of Prince Derek and Jean Bob, the new villains, the disappointing plot of some characters' annoying habits and animation very simple.
