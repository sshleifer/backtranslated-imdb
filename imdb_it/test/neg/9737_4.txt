For me this film was a disappointment. Somehow I expected him to explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in World War II. But there is none of this, he takes care of the last two years of his life and tries, in a sense, to whiten it. So, I just have to assume that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in the business of conquest and killing, with no particular charm or notoriety in behavior. People in real life don't just make good film material. I'm almost sorry for James Mason, really one of my favorite actors, who had to play a pretty wooden character. Actually, a good director and a great acting talent were wasted on this movie ?? with the exception of Luther Adler who gives a truly memorable and strangely naturalistic portrait of Adolf Hitler. There may also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors who imitate the Germans are not credible. Rommel, for example, is perceived here not only as a German but as a typical "southern" of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg: one immediately thinks of a certain dialect, a certain kind of spirit, a certain way of seeing the world (the total for example a "Prussian" junker "). I also think that there are now mixed feelings about the July 20 assassination attempt, many of those involved in the conspiracy were not Democrats and just wanted German troops to join together to the western allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (thus prolonging the war forever). <br /> <br /> The best cinematographic portrait of an intelligent intellectual military mind is, in my opinion, still Patton (1970). General Patton can be glimpsed for a brief moment in the large documentary space used for this film, a low angle while he is inspecting the vehicles passing by. The holster open and the revolver with the ma Mother-of-pearl nopoles are clearly visible!
