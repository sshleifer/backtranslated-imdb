I could not. I was bored, not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a b-movie whose plot was all about cannibalism, but the fact that I was looking at a foreign movie subtitle, which didn't bother me at all, but it was still nicknamed. <br /> <br /> The "special effects" were horrible. As the back of the plane breaks, you can see that the model is empty as it "breaks away" from the fake snow. Most of the film takes place on a sound stage that is clearly not real and almost looks like a play, because the "sounds" of snow blowing everywhere are heard but not really scenes. <br /> <br /> "But what will they eat? They have no food" says a military person (it is never clear what this guy does or why he is in charge) says, that I'm sure no one has ever actually said not even thinking about food, since they were worried if people were alive, not how they would eat. It was simply a stupid line written to indicate that, yes, they had to eat corpses to survive. <br /> <br /> When they finally decide to eat the bodies, a man finds a body without a shirt, which despite being in the snow for a while, is not frozen in remote, in fact, his flesh is very flexible and fresh. Fresh meat is removed from the shoulders, which again is not frozen or even cold appears, and this scene goes on for five minutes. That's where I had to stop. The "Alive" remake was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that I'm sure the real survivors praised while I can't imagine any of them having something nice to say about this version. It was simply eating corpses and everything else was secondary. To avoid.
