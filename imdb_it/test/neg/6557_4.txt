I've been a big fan of the original Enterprise crew since I was eight. I watched all the movies and enjoyed each of them for what they kept from the old series and to further develop the characters (and the Star Trek universe in general). Also in "The Undiscovered Country" I thought that the aging of the characters was well managed and the story worthy of a theatrical release. However, having said that, "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier" is easily the worst of the series with the original crew. I agree with many that the camaraderie of Kirk, Spock and McCoy is well managed, but the general script, the direction of William Shatner and the special effects are not worthy of anything more than a television episode. This is a "buddy movie" and, at times, almost unrecognizable as a Star Trek movie. Action sequences are not supported and therefore, create little or no tension. Dialogue is weak even if it involves some laughter, both intentional and unintentional. The Klingons seem like an afterthought. The whole concept of "Sha-Ka-Ree" is simply silly and Laurence Luckinbill, a good actor in everything else I've ever seen in him, an absurd boarder in this film. The scene in which Sybok evokes images of Spock's pain and McCoy's pain shatters the image of the characters as we have known them. Spock would never have started such stupidity and McCoy, trying to save his father, is full of silly and redundant dialogues and totally wastes the acting skills of DeForest Kelley. The whole scene is wasted and actually shows us nothing new and nothing that we want to see from these characters. I understand that Shatner didn't have the luxury of working with ILM for special effects and that the budget for this film was tight, but that doesn't allow such a bad story. In some ways, I think this story is in keeping with the old series, but the movies, including "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" are all much better quality than this. It's a shame that most of the other characters have so few lines and so little to do with most of this movie. The attention on Kirk, McCoy and Spock is nice, but very used. The old crew really seems to be out of character. I liked the old General Klingon and the sensual Romulan in the bar. I liked the humor and the idea that Spock has a half brother, but that's all. If it were a television episode, I would be able to accept many flaws. As a film, this is just a bad, uninspired film making. It's also a pity, because I want this film to be good. Even if it was the level of "Star Trek III" I would be happy, but this film makes all the other films in this series look like works by Shakespeare.
