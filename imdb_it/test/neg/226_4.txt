"Fool for Love" is one of many forgotten films, Robert Altman, directed throughout the 80s. This, a film adaptation of a Sam Shepard comedy featuring Shepard in the lead role, simply isn't very good. Over the course of his fascinating career, Altman has made many films that are not very good, and many times the blame was his. But here I think it's the fault of Shepard for writing such a tenuous game. The management of Altman is insured, the exhibitions are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this insignificant script doesn't go anywhere, and takes its time to get there. <br /> <br /> Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love / hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two quarrel endlessly during an evening spent in a dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who can be either a figurative or literal father both for Eddie and for May quietly observes. Randy Quaid completes the cast of four as a gentleman interlocutor. <br /> <br /> The only dramatic connection of the whole plot is the suggestion that the relationship between Eddie and May is incestuous. However, this hook looks more like a gimmick than anything else. The script does not explore their relationship in any detail, and does not use their relationship to explore more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric and mannerist characters that become irritating in the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film is particularly bad, when the stories of Eddie and May return to appear in flashbacks on a monotonous and sleepy voice. <br /> <br /> Chalk this up to another of Altman's experiments gone wrong. <br /> <br /> Vote: C-
