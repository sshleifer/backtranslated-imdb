Now I understand that it took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty sure my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie made me so sick that I couldn't even pay much attention. Only the proof that the boobs that women carry cannot always save you from horrible writings, acting and directing. Now I understand that this is not a budget effort, but there is not even continuity and no real reason not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh, there are some decent-looking women who show the merchandise. However, there are not enough sexy women alive to justify the vision of this disguise perpetrated in the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I took it out with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and prepare your weapon because you might want to use it after this hacking job. Finally, the individual (deficient) who left a comment before mine thought it was a great movie and LOVED it. Only more proof that the brothers should not create. Ow, BURN !!! - Captain J
