I didn't understand the people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible movie in any respect. Plot, acting, art, dialogue, music, whatever! I don't mind a low budget ... However you have to get a point. Wandering around, asking ... useless ... then two boys started kissing on the bed. horrible, just awful. I love independent films, no matter it's slow. However, this film disappointed me in every way. Even the Graffito, not artistic. I wondered what kind of people they would like. I am a female in her thirties. Is it for teenagers who have a kind of loneliness for life, or just don't understand? What did I gain then? Lost time! Please go for others.
