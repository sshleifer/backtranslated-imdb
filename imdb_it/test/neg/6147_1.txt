More scary than any horror film ever made because you're controlled by this blood feast that makes it scarier than watching other people do it on the big screen or on your TV screen. This game has two CDs that make the game much more fun. <br /> <br /> Each CD contains a different character with a completely different storyline that makes the game much more fun. I advise you to buy this game and also the first game (it's not as good as this game, still fun) <br /> <br /> **** <br /> <br />
