I like movies, but I didn't find anything I like about The Box. I was interested in the "hook" of the plot, but unfortunately it never went anywhere and was impossible to follow. Anyone who claims to have understood this film probably does so by pretending to feel part of something, well I have news for them, the emperor has no clothes. <br /> <br /> The only undertone in this film is that women are responsible for the original sin and corrupt humanity. I've heard that story before, and every time it makes less and less sense. It is true that this film is different from many films currently shown in theaters, but this is not worth the ticket price.
