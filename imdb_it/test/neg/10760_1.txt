Filmmaker Bryan Forbes, who once showed a light and sardonic touch with eye-catching materials like "Whistle Down the Wind" and the original "Stepford Wives", is completely at its peak. Not only is his direction inept, but he has also adapted Sidney Sheldon's first novel; the results are atrocious. Roger Moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients; Rod Steiger, chewing the landscape, is a hot-flawless cop (it's easily his most embarrassing performance). The only actor here to show some life is Elliott Gould, who knows a thing or two about the animation of a script from a tramp. Bland, choppy and cheap product. NO STARS from ****
