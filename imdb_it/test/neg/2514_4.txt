Having seen Carlo Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was much more anticipated before watching this film made three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer like me was dissatisfied ... I faced the need for a critical opinion, which generally I don't like to give because there are no documentaries that satisfy every viewer. There are also no documentaries that will fully examine a theme. But when I read the reviews already written about this title, I also felt a bit confused. People sometimes don't know what to criticize. Therefore, to be clear, I will divide this film into two main parts that differ greatly: the previous one on Visconti before his career as a director and the second on Visconti the director. <br /> <br /> The aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that the young Luchino has experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented. His commitment to horse racing and his relationship with his mother, so disturbed by his parents' divorce, are mentioned. We also have a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino grew up as a true count of Milan: in abundance galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in the REAL ARISTOCRACY. For example, the splendid villa of his father in Grazzano and other wonderful villas prove it. There is also an emphasis on Visconti's crucial visit to Paris in the 1930s, in which he met eminent people ("ailerons") who later influenced his style and his message in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​a communist with aristocratic education (a contrast at first sight). <br /> <br /> However, the career-related part of his director, which began with OBSESSION during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE shortly before the director's death in 1976, is poorly executed. His films are not discussed well. Why? Because there are very few people who really have something to say. Franco Zeffirelli, the director, remembers the work on LA TERRA TREMA and that's fine. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, films such as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, DEATH IN VENICE or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I didn't like his interviews. Moreover, some thoughts that he reveals are not accurate to include in such a documentary ... There is no mention of significant works by Visconti as CONVERSATION PEPE, there are no interviews with the eminent cast Burt Lancaster. Also mention should be made of Silvana Mangano and Romy Schneider. There is a video interview with Maria Callas that looks interesting but that is just a little. Franco Zeffirelli, although I appreciate him as a director, makes fun of everything and does not say anything really precious. For example, he mentions the event about how Visconti separated from him after years of service. Therefore, I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> What I find a strong point here are the interviews with Visconti himself. As a result, we may get your opinion on your works. For example, I greatly appreciate the words he says about death about it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself. He also discusses his health problems after the stroke during the filming of LUDWIG. <br /> <br /> I think it's best to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) by Carlo Lizzani of this document. Even if it is shorter and condensed as a whole, you will have a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be furious at this and his fury has usually transformed the emotions and points of view of people into stone ... 4/10
