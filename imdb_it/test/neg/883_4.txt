If you read the book before you see the movie you might be disappointed as I was. The book was fantastic and I was sure after seeing the preview of the film that the film would be great, but it seemed to me like watching a movie where the director and the cast didn't even read these characters. The film is short and in reality it never makes us feel that these people were really in love and felt like mates. Even if the film had not gone in the same direction as the book, at least they could have made the relationship between these two characters more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and have good chemistry, but they didn't develop a plot long enough to let us see how much they wanted each other. The book was a true love story and I think this film could be much better.
