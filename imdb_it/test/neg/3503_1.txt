I'm amazed that someone likes this movie. I never leave the movies, but my friend had to physically stop me from leaving the theater during this insulting disaster. white characters are saints and Asian characters are practically non-existent and worthless for history. they exist only as objects, surprise. characters from other races travel much better. the turns were ridiculous and predictable. but if you are reading this, you already know it. Paul Haggis is a hack. Hollywood can't even make multicultural films. do yourself a favor and look at a much more honest relationship about race relations, Harold and Kumar Go to the White Castle!
