Very often it can be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to remember important historical events and make them interesting enough to keep the story alive. THE BATTLE OF BRAVE faces the eighteenth-century struggle for the control of Quebec (an entire Canada) between the English and the French with the sidebars that make up the new America. It has the features of an epic epic of charm, but unfortunately in the hands of the writer Pierre Billon (whose screenplay deserves a Razzie award for the worst of the season) and the sparse, fuzzy and confused direction of Jean Beaudin, this film is a real disaster - a boring disaster of two hours and a quarter of a movie. <br /> <br /> Even a good actor cast - the combination of Noémie Godin-Vigneau with Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as François le Gardeur, adding the adorable Bianca Gervais as Acoona, the venerable Gérard Depardieu such as Le curé Thomas Blondeau, and Irène Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in vintage wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as Général James Wolfe - does not help veteran actors like these must have scrupled to the crude lines written for their characters! Cover the whole casino in a mushy Patrick Doyle music and the result is a long film to avoid. Sad to say such nasty things about an expensive project, but be careful ... Grady Harp
