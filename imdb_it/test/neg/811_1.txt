Set in 1945, Skenbart follows a failed Swedish book publisher who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around him, he is a walking disaster, causing chaos wherever he goes. The train also holds a man and his mistress who plots to kill the man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on the way home, two homosexual gentlemen, an angry conductor, two nuns, a group of refugees and even more people. <br /> <br /> Shown as a mix of noir-ish thriller (which does quite well - at least to start), and comedy, the film fails with both. It is not at the moment when the film changes tone with each new scene. And as the train runs towards its final destination, the film becomes increasingly bizarre, ending up on a truly surreal note. <br /> <br /> Beautiful pieces are wasted on a myriad of useless plots and characters. Skenbart is full of famous Swedish actors, no matter how small the part is. It seems that the directors called everyone they worked with and offered them a part in the film. It's a pity that the performances are just as bad as the script (read the lines - don't read them!). <br /> <br /> Comedy is more or less slapstick, with the same bars repeated over and over again. The rhythm is incredibly slow at times (very often, actually) with particular scenes dragged for about ten minutes without a good reason. The writer also seems to think that swearing is a good way to replace decent dialogue. The film looks nice, in the moody B & W, but is wasted on an inept movie in every other department. [1/10]
