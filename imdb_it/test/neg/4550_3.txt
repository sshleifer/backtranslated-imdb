If you like soap-series, you might like this movie. I recommend this film to fans of Dutch soap shows such as GTST, Westenwind or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you don't like that stuff, stay away from this movie. It has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, directing and writing. The film was a great success on the national territory, but was not sold elsewhere outside the Netherlands and Belgium. It's rather strange for a commercial film like this. <br /> <br /> Maybe it says something ....
