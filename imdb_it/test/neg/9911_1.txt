This film is something horrible. I was laughing all the time. I was forced to stop at some scenes because my mom thought it wasn't polite to laugh when people die, but in this movie, death also seems ridiculous. Especially when Tornado Tommy gets sucked into a tornado. <br /> <br /> The explosions of cars thrown on buildings by wind forces are similar to those of the old side-scrolling game called R-Type. The dialogues are bad and I'm interested in knowing how they managed to convince some actors to act in this film. It's simply amazing how such a bad movie can turn it into TV. <br /> <br /> Just a real reason to watch this movie is having fun with absurdity and absurdity.
