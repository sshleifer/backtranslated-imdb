This movie is horrible. The script is stupid and obviously the chase doesn't tell Zoey she doesn't love her !!! Like every episode ... I never understand zoey 101 (the show) Besides, because hell, Logan's father behaves in such a reassembled way. And it's just about zoey and chasing what to say about the other characters. It is always the same in every episode that Quinn does and the invention does something terribly wrong with the invention and the ziobi always get involved. If you haven't seen it, don't waste an hour watching this cuz, you'll waste your time !! SMaybe, it might be interesting for a child of eight, 8-10, but I imagine that everyone else is watching this movie retarted. But what can you expect from nick ???
