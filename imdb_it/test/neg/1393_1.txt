I absolutely love standing comedy. I like to listen to the raw thoughts of the stand-up on the stage, because they attract an audience of their peers different life experiences that they have had, or things that they thought or saw that they thought were so stupid **** that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There were stand-ups that hired a character that everyone could identify with (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or they were so damn crazy that you couldn't help but laugh with them as you laughed to others (Richard Pryor). And then there were the stimulating comics like George Carlin, who, despite pretending to be a loon, was the smartest guy in the room, who appealed to people to rethink the things they saw when they went around, and to realize how fucking things were, and how easily things could change. <br /> <br /> Now, this might seem to have nothing to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show", but that's it. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show making stand-up pieces for his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most often just about racism and racial stereotypes. Try to be all three types of stand-ups listed above. He is a theatrical character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos who, despite the stereotypes, is just the typical normal boy. He then proceeds to try to laugh at others, people he calls racist or simply those who disagree with his opinion. And then, finally, he presents skits to the studio audience and to the viewer, telling them that he will help them see his point of view. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia always says he is showing a point of view that people wear Capisco, but what he is really doing is not just promoting racist stereotypes that already exist and have been joked about death, but foolishly encourages people to hear them and do the only thing that helps them keep them around: laugh. /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the simplest, but simple, way to get laughs in stand-up. The best comedians, I fear, Carlos Mencia feel in good company, do not have to resort to them. They speak universally, and ask you to laugh at nonsense, rather than with it, as Mencia encourages. While creating more skits or "real" situations that require racism or the scourge of others with the use of it, it tells us, rather than asking, to laugh, and actually presents these absurdities as truths, rather than just extremes of it . <br /> <br /> His show is an insult to the minds of those who watch it. Mencia does not give us the comedy and asks us to digest and take what we want (something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "the best quality of Chappelle's Show") tells us exactly how we should see and react to it - - which, according to him, is to make a stupid face and say "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is appropriately called. It's really a show on "The Mind of Mencia". It is Mencia's mind, in every way, and as such, it is nothing but stupid fun. The show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its base audience, aged 14 to 24, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial racism is good for Carlos Mencia, and so it should be good for you!
