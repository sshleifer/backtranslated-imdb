RICH. is the STUPIDEST film ever made. I can't believe my dad bought this shit. This film should never be made. If this movie is known, believe me it will be in first place for IMDB's worst record. The acting is horrible, it's scary, and that's why it's horror. This piece of s *** has never had any horror. It's an urban action, which is fun, because I could swear it was a comedy. When people shot themselves I couldn't help laughing. I'm the only person who has reviewed this and I hope to be the last. With this vote I only hope that you get to the number 1 spot for the worst !!!!!!!
