A spaceship in an unspecified future in which humans are equipped for space travel and have laser gun guns, crash into a strange young planet where dinosaurs have evolved randomly and only on this world have not died out ... yet. The survivors of the incident, roughly ten bland characters wearing blue, white and yellow suits, fight for survival against the prehistoric alien monsters. <br /> <br /> "The planet of the dinosaurs" is a singular film. As I said in my summary above, the stop-motion animated dinosaurs in the film are the only colorful actors. The models are rough but effectively animated. And they are much more fascinating and intriguing than these characters played by inexperienced actors and talking lines from a script that must have been written overnight without a single revision. Obviously, most of the budget has been put into the dinosaurs, and even if there is a good part of them, there is almost not enough to save us from boredom. These human characters are only there to scream, run, and mumble these poorly written and verbose talks about survival. And unfortunately, not enough of them are eaten by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Planet of the Dinosaurs" is not a film I am planning to review. Some people will simply love it for being so cheap and so poorly made. Sometimes, I like movies like this. But this particular film is too long, too boring and very grueling in the mind.
