This film has been compared to the funny British comedy "A Fish Called Wanda", although I can't understand why. The only connection I can find is Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise the two are incomparable. <br /> <br /> Idle and Robbie Coltrane are two gangsters who want to get out of business before they end up dead, so they decide to rob their boss and get to Rio. When the vacation goes bad, the two are forced to take refuge in a convent, as nuns. <br /> <br /> What at first promises to be a riot soon becomes a predictable medium movie with the usual jokes of insipid sex and tasteless humor. Once again there are the occasional high points, but neither the cast nor the crew manage to inspire the proceedings. Even an attempt to finish "manic" like "Wanda" fails, along with the effort of humor "men in drag", which is not surprising. When you think about it, men who try to be women are fun, men who try to be nuns is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
