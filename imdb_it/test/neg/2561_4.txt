I remember when he came out he was the first kung fu movie ever seen on our street and we were all excited to see it for sure. Although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of ugly dubbing and bad film production or, more precisely, the way the Chinese were making movies at the time. They were admittedly inferior to the question, but there was the value of entertainment here and that certainly happened. The kung fu craze had begun and Bruce Lee and "The Chinese Connection" would soon follow that or "The Chinese Boxer" with Jimmy Wang Yu. In any case, this film was chosen to lead the way.
