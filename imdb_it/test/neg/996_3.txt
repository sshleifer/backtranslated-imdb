The black and white satire of a Madison Avenue advertising agency is taken over by the blacks. They are directed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson) who is determined to change things. However, it is also PESSATO compared to its white predecessors. This is as original as this. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this was considered bold and shocking in 1969, but today it seems silly. The jokes are not funny (the president is a midget, how funny is that?), Cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikely characters. It is done in a very experimental way that makes it even more difficult to take ... or understand. The film becomes more bizarre and surreal as it proceeds. The ending comes out of nowhere. To make matters worse, with the sole exception of Johnson, ALL the acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (a regular in these types of films) is particularly annoying as Arabic. This gets three stars because commercial parodies (done in bright colors) ARE fun and there is a rare good line here and there. I heard it was a cult classic, but it's more interesting than beautiful. Jump ... unless you're in the experimental films of the 60s.
