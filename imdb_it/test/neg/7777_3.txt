There is no way to put into words how bad, without form, without peace and without laughing these "Vice-Academy" films. You must experience one for yourself. For the third consecutive time, writer and director Rick Sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or a talented director. There is nothing here that a person over 5 can believe or laugh, but the (very short) nudity and other "plot" elements make films unsuitable for children. Which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental abilities of 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan is more than a pleasant substitute for Linnea Quigley - she is captivating and carefree, and her wonderful smile is the only thing that can make even a spectator smile. But looking at her and the other girls in this movie is like looking at a bunch of flowers in a desert covered in horse manure. (*)
