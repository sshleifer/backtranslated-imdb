I can laugh at anything, but unfortunately there isn't one in this smelly bomb !!!! I honestly watched this movie from beginning to end, and I didn't even smile. I'm shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade etc. They put their names on this piece of shit. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst ever released by former SNL players. What else can I say? How is it possible that such an insipid, extremely shameless crisis comes from such an apparent talent! Maybe I lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but I can't remember a movie that I haven't enjoyed for a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never return.
