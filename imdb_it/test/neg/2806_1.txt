If you've been to Eastern Europe (or even their armed forces), you might find this film interesting. I don't know why it calls it a comedy (of course, there are some funny moments), but it's not a good movie if one of the ordained officers talks for 15 minutes about the conquests of socialism during a Christmas dinner, and the officers in general behave like funny brats, the soldiers run to the base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the commander's daughter. The East German army was known for its abusive and humiliating service of its enlisted men, and the play was not substantially turned into facilities or equipment to make a good film of the East German army and their time now gone. Despite this, some of the actors and actresses have tried to behave well, but only came out in the roles that are known for East German TV and some small films. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
