This film could have been much better than it was if it hadn't been a Disney movie. I thought the girl who played Shirley was okay, you could tell she was really trying to do the right job. The teenager Shirley Temple was not quite right. I think they should have spent the last time in his childhood, the first hour should have been young Shirley, so the last hour should have been for old Shirley. This was a boring film, and not a good story about Shirley Temple.
