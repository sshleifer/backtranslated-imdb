Blackwater Valley Exorcism is set on a small ranch where Isabelle (Kristin Erickson) is found wandering the streets covered with dog blood. Her parents Ely (Randy Colton) & Blanche (Leslie Fleming-Mitchell) own the ranch and are deeply concerned about their daughter, she was not herself recently and is considered a danger to herself and others. The hand of the ranch and the former priest Miguel (Del Zamora) recognize Isabelle's symptoms as a possible case of possession and when she begins to speak ancient Latin with a strange voice she becomes convinced. Blanche calls the priest Jacob (Cameron Daddo), who is the ex-husband of Claire's daughter (Madison Taylor) to see Isabelle, confirms Miguel's suspicions and accepts the task of performing the exorcism that we hope to banish the demon inside Isabelle and a free innocent girl. .. <br /> <br /> Directed by Ethan Wiley I was sitting there in my house in front of my telly watching the exorcism of the Blackwater Valley and I kept asking the same question all the time, because I do it. Why do I keep looking at all these horrible low-budget horror films that seem to have been shot on a video camera? Fair enough to tell this honestly, Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a complete and utter shameless fear of The Exorcist (1973) and you literally tick the main points of the plot that the two share. There is the possessed teenager who begins to get very excited and suggests inappropriate things, the demon who uses minor crimes against others, worried parents, the way the possessed girl is avoided by the doctor, the priest with a past troubled and the possessed girl is tied to her bed among other things. I suppose the Blackwater Valley Exorcism is different (apart from its total crap) is that it tries to give everyone the screen of the character's time and tries to understand how the situation is hitting them but it is written and interpreted so badly that it ends up being boring. The film starts with Isabelle already owned, so we never knew what a normal person was like, so we never care about her or what's happening to her, the rest of the character is poorly written and not well made. Sometimes I wondered if the Blackwater Valley exorcism was a parody, there is a silly scene in which a veterinarian tries to quell the possessed Isabelle with tranquilizers on horseback and after claiming she needs a "small puncture" enters in his room with a huge needle hidden behind him! There are some scenes where people are punched accompanied by a silly comedy sound effect. The film has an irregular tone as a result of a silly parody and a dramatic series of horror, or at least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> According to some texts before the opening titles Blackwater Valley Exorcism was based on "Actual Events", yes just real events of 1973 happened in a film called The Exorcist ... This piece of text also states that the exorcism scenes were supervised by a true priest. There is not even a fair amount of exploitation to revive things, there is a scene of a broken arm, there is a dead dog, someone is stabbed with a crucifix and that is all. There is surprisingly no bad language in it although the demon is trying to be offensive. I guess the only reason why the Blackwater Valley exorcism has an adult rating is due to a very short scene where you see a pair of breasts. A pair of nude female breasts is not worth watching this or the money you could spend on it. There is zero fear, no atmosphere and a truly amateur feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> With an alleged budget of around $ 1,000,000 I have to say I'm wondering where all the money went, the film looks ugly & cheap in everything. There are no special effects to talk about and the production values ​​are fundamental. The acting is very poor for everyone involved, Jeffrey Combs' favorite genre is approaching the highest levels during the opening credits, but it has nothing more than a cameo in what amounts to about five minutes of screen duration. He too must have feared how bad it would have been, he hid behind his mustache and a terrible accent, it's better than that. <br /> <br /> The exorcism of the Blackwater Valley is a complete rip-off of The Exorcist without all that made the film so classic and the producers have been late for thirty-five years. A total turkey from beginning to end.
