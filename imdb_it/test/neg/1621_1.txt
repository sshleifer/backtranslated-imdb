This movie was so bad that it was fun! For a while I thought I was watching a parody of a bad movie (in the "For Your Consideration"). The "cliffhanger" scene eventually made me laugh until my gut hurt. The script was pretty awful, but combined with the terrible acting of Sean Young - especially while explaining the whole story in great detail (complete with flashback) while dangling from a cliff - it makes it a truly classic movie that is worth watching! In fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an Ed Wood movie. I still can't believe how this thing was done. First of all, how did such a negative script get the green light? How were the leading actors attacked? Were they low in their careers? Questions, questions
