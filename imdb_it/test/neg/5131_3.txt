This film obviously had good intentions. In the end there is a dedication to someone named Kellie who, as a spectator, I can only assume that she found herself in a situation similar to that represented by the film. Maybe he made the "wrong" choice. That dedication is the ONLY saving quality of Love & Suicide. <br /> <br /> The film becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. Once the viewer is already so irritated for just about five minutes in the film, it will be pretty much downhill after ... what it was. I know the film was low budget and the shooting was actually pretty good ... unfortunately everything else was horrible. Acting, plot, sound quality, image quality ... acting. I'm sorry, but the acting is horrible. Over horrible. It is as if the actors were trying to behave as if people were acting. This is the only way I can think of describing it. While watching, I actually imagined the script with the stage direction in my mind. None of the movements was natural and none of the characters' reactions were perfect. In short: timing is WAY. The times of the whole film are far away. I am not a director so I know the limits of my knowledge but I really feel that there had to be ANY way to convey the passage of time ... until they explained that the degree is not too far away I had the impression that the first part of the film had taken place within a week ... at most a month. <br /> <br /> That said, it's really a pity. This film could have been really powerful with a little tweaking. All the moments in the movie where we should hear something are obvious, but only because the set-up is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes fell completely flat. For example, when Kaye's brother takes his hat from his head and puts it on his own, we should feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and protection of his brother's love ... somehow, not it turns out that way. There are so many other scenes like this (for example: ALL combat scenes) and all they do is take the film off. All these things put together, Love & Suicide is presented as a long, poor, low budget advertisement.
