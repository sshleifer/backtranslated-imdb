It's terrible garbage. I liked 'How Do You Want Me', 'Father Ted', 'Green Wing' and Bill Bailey's stand up act, but I archive it with 'Hippies' and 'Planets Of The Apes' (the re-imagination) under 'Great Pedigree, gone bad ". My hypothesis is that it is aimed at the same people who like' Withnail and me '. It is overwritten, but for a short time, the air of luvvie pervades it and Bernard Black is simply less field of Withnail. And I thought it was self-indulgent even * before * Dylan Moran became the writer, but the development shows off such a comic potential that for the first two episodes I didn't even notice that it wasn't the least worthy of knowing. . <br /> <br /> The things they are saying / doing should * Have fun, but somehow they can't register as if they were slightly funny or "I can see how someone who writes this might have thought it would be fun ". What I am trying to say is that the situations / observations are light humorous and yet too mundane / kind / consciously surreal entity to be worthy of being created and represented in a sitcom. <br /> <br /> Life is too short. To avoid.
