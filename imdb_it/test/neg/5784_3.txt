Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and complacent film that recklessly uses the conflict in the Middle East as a backdrop for an action movie invented for a comfortably protected Mid-West American audience. The conflict, as well as those involved, is used simply as cannon fodder to glorify young photogenic Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the sake of "freedom". But what is worse is that the action scenes of the film are handled carelessly and not very exciting, which prevents Navy Seals from even functioning as an irreverent shooter. <br /> <br /> The character of Charlie Sheen (Hawkins) is disgusting, obnoxious, ignorant, reckless and above all racist. It refers to the Middle East as a "t-hole" and to its inhabitants as "rags heads". Throughout the film, the characters of the Navy Seals are glorified through the use of the Lebanese natives as cannon fodder. Indiscriminately, they massacre these people with an unimportant attitude. There is even the tasteless murder of a young Lebanese boy killed by Hawkins; Hawkins teases his tongue before shooting him while making another humorous joke. In addition to being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The film's extreme (albeit predictable) pro-American attitude is also revolting. This can be seen when the Lebanese-American female journalist informs Hawkins that terrorists cannot be talked about because "they are religious zealots". Hawkins then replies with "Yes, and we are the Seals Navy!" The implication is of course that the Zealots are meaningless alongside American military power. Also, even after insulting this journalist's racial legacy and treating her as a sexual object, the script requires her inability to resist this disgusting thug and she ends up sleeping with him - because she is an All-American Navy Seal. This marginalizes the character of the journalist making her submissive to Hawkins' pro-American attitude, despite her offensive behavior towards him. Beyond ethics, this twist also has little credibility as a drama. <br /> <br /> Even the script is amateur. Most of the scenes are simply joined together without any thought for the character's mood, plot or development. The "music video" scene on the golf course, for example, is just a delightful eye candy. And the two scenes in which Charlie Sheen plays the reckless hero are also useless. In one, he jumps off a moving car from a bridge just to show his companions how hard he is, and in the other he chases a tow truck on a push bike and pushes his car out of it. Neither scene has anti-climax follow-up, both are highly unlikely, and neither has any relation to the plot as a whole. They are just sweets designed as a vehicle to show off Hawkins' heroic economic all-Americans, and they are poor substitutes for character development. Most of the other plot development scenes are also poorly filmed and misplaced, in fact this affliction affects the entire film. Apart from the African American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, every other member of the team seems unknown to the public, so that when the climatic scenes revolve around them it doesn't seem like anyone to do the cheering and the death of someone to complain. <br /> <br /> In this film, action sequences can potentially save production. But they don't do it here. These are misdirected, ill-lit and show poorly performed acrobatics. In fact, their direction is so poor that they are almost inconsistent for the viewer, which leads not only to incomprehensibly difficult scenes to follow, but also to a complete lack of fear and suspense. Poor lighting only increases their impotence. The explosions seem fake, gunshot wounds don't convince and one of the most daring stunts, which involves crashing into a Mercedes over a tank, looks like a stunt that was staged on a backlot and then badly modified. <br /> <br /> the end of Navy Seals firmly puts the coins on the eyes of this production. First there is the obligatory slow-motion scene "running away from the big explosion-which-should-kill me-me" with Sheen carrying Biehn on his shoulders. This was obviously the default scene intended to be the protagonist of the movie trailers. Then there is the ending itself when the remains of the Seal team, wounded and floating in the ocean, are saved by a submarine. This submarine had in fact returned home long ago, but obviously had miraculously returned in time. All in all, despite the violent and stressful ordeal of the Seals, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, with a number of them who continue to bleed sharply, everyone can laugh heartily while they bless America in a violent way. Predictable? One can only imagine this ending while watching the opening credits. <br /> <br /> This film indulgently uses the Middle East conflict as a vehicle for the macho All-American tendencies of young photogenic filmmakers. The Arabs are treated in a condescending and contemptuous manner, and their massacre in the film is used as a fulcrum to glorify the use of American military force against a "lower" minority group in an environment without consequences. The events of 2001 have shown that such a banality and trivialization of the conflicts of these minority groups is certainly not a consequence of free pastime. The Middle East can no longer be erased like a t-hole full of rags that come off each other (to quote Charlie Sheen here); now it is a place where involvement can lead to serious consequences. Today we are reminded that the consequences of such arrogance can occur quite close to home. Therefore, in any case, the Navy Seals seem rather stupid these days; but this must be kind. This is a very ignorant film, whose production and professionalism values ​​are equally suspect. Navy Seals is, ideologically and artistically, a complete insult to the intelligence of its audience.
