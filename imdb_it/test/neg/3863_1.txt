Film Noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tact, intelligence, intelligence and imagination. This film has none of this, even if they really tried with images. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie your cousin Marky, the truck driver, who is always talking about how he can make the movie great, someday, would do it. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The images, although obviously expensive to make, are the work of a director who tried to be intelligent and failed miserably due to a severe lack of brain skills. The acting ranged from sub-par to bad. The story may have been saved by a real writer and director, but I suspect these people wouldn't have touched him with a barge pole. <br /> <br /> At about 1/4 of this distance, I noticed striking similarities to the scene in Sim0ne where Viktor, desperate to get rid of his actress, makes the worst movie in the world. I thought I'd check IMDb to see if a similar effect occurred in this movie, and to my surprise it did. I would almost be tempted to give a 2 out of 10 just because it is exposed to pretentious groupies, but I won't. It's so bad.
