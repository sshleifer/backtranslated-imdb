My mother brought me this movie on a DVD. A guy in a rental advised him. But in fact, this could be the worst movie I've ever seen. You know, I didn't expect much from this movie, but it didn't have a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was meaningless. I couldn't wait to see Christine Lakin in this film because I loved step by step. She too was a huge disappointment. The story was completely unreal. One of the party boys died (he wasn't dead, in fact, he woke up later), the house looks like a bomb went off and there are 2 guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. But then a homosexual arrives, a policeman ... Is there a total mess to the end and the boys have managed to mount and everything in about 15 minutes ??? Come on, just be realistic. Waste of money. Really...
