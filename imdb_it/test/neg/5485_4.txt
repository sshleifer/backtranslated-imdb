This is my first Almodavar film. I will confess that we chose it mainly because we knew that this had the tantalizing perspective of Antonio Banderas in gay sex scenes. Unfortunately, this is all that this film has to recommend. I consider myself a rather sophisticated spectator, I like European films, "art" films and I am generally able to recognize a quality film even if it is not for my particular taste. <br /> <br /> But this film was a complete emptiness for me. The plot was ridiculous, the characters lifeless, the box called it a "hilarious comedy" but I didn't laugh once. Built casually and awkwardly, with lots of useless dialogues. I don't understand this at all, it seems like an amateur effort. Can anyone enlighten me?
