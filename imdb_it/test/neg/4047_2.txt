This must be one of the weakest plots in a film I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> However, it is not all that is missing in this film. This movie has the worst acting, writing, directing, special effects, you call it - it's the worst ever. <br /> <br /> I strongly advise you to dedicate your time to valuable films and not waste time on this rejection. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous post that "women" were definitely men dressed in drag, and this made me laugh, I keep trying to figure out if they were obvious about it or if they were actually looking for to be sexy women. <br /> <br /> However, there isn't much else in this movie that is worth watching! <br /> <br /> In summary: horrible acting, horrible screenplay, horrible idea for a film. An hour and a half of my life I want back NOW !!
