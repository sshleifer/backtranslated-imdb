This in-name-only sequel to the classic ROADHOUSE has a DEA agent (John Schaech) who comes to the rescue of his uncle (Will Patton) when his uncle is beaten by a local drug gang, led by that wooden Indian an actor Jake Busey. The band wants to conquer the poor boy's bar for nefarious reasons. Patrick Swayze is seriously missing here. Schaech is an indifferent and unconvincing actor like a man kicking ass. The fighting here is intermittent and not as powerful or vicious as the struggles in ROADHOUSE. The ending is equally weak. Some good-looking women keep things afloat for a while. There is a terrifying struggle between a Daisy Duke guy who turns out to be handy with both fists and weapons, and a bad-looking Busey girl who's handy with sharp tools. There is also a little girl in the beginning who is a colleague of Schaech, but unfortunately never reappears in the film. Sin. He does a short lap dance for Schaech who has had my full attention. If nothing else, ROADHOUSE 2 kicks off with a strip club scene that is regretted next to what looks like a real strip club, a rare occurrence in every movie. The rest is snooze time.
