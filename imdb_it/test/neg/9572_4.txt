I had to lower my rating of this movie to 4 due to the terrible audio track. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a problem with me or the tape, because some actors and the soundtrack played great. But most of the actors' voices were distorted or tangled beyond recognition, especially for non-English people. <br /> <br /> There are many small twists that would make this movie fun - ending it in Bosnia by mistake is great - but much of the humor has been lost in the sound.
