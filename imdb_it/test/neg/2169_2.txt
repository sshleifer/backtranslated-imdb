While the writing was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the only thing that saved this "asshole" was the counting of the breasts, but it wasn't enough to make me look again. That being said, I'm really dumber than watching this movie. This was a new low for Troma. Lloyd Kaufman who started the film wearing a garbage bag and making fart noises should have let me know what I was getting into. This was by far the worst ever put out by the Troma team. The best place to show this movie would be for the disabled, who can't get up to change channels. To conclude, it is not a quick recommendation to watch this film for breast only.
