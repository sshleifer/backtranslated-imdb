See ... I really wanted to enjoy this movie. There were times when my heart was beating faster, when my hair started to stand up, when my muscles started to tighten ... but just like a striptease, I was left with no real actions, no resolution and no money my wallet. <br /> <br /> Jaume Balaguer√≥ and Miguel Tejada-Flores apparently do not know the correct recipe for making a horror film and, as such, have used the method of the old amateur cook to throw everything on the plate. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually The Shining, Poltergeist, Amityville and Hellraiser all in one. Unbelievable, I know, but true. All the flavors are there, you can taste each of them, they just don't mix well. I will not list all the wrong things in this film; in short, good cinematography, mediocre acting, worse dialogues. <br /> <br /> The real problem of stealing from so many movies and combining them in a movie, apart from the resulting confusion, is while you can have several textures running at the same time, it's not possible to have different endings. And what does Jaume do when he encounters this problem? Just like a freshman in English 101, you end your story with ellipses, "The little machine faded into darkness and ..... THE END" Oooh, spooky. Not exactly. And very anticlimatic. The ending left me confused and disappointed; almost empty. <br /> <br /> Take your $ 10, go to rent The Shining, Poltergeist and Hellraiser .. scare your pants, have fun and forget that The Darkness has ever existed. <br /> <br /> -BJamin
