the usual disclaimer - I do not attribute 1-star ratings to films that are harmless, bad, low-budget and stupid, though they might deserve it. These films are often fun and are rated 2-4 based on entertainment value, not a representation of their exemplary art film. This film fits this model perfectly. It's a film of Mexican monsters, full of over-voice and extremely not-so-special narrative effects. The trick is not so bad, and acting is sometimes pretty funny, but this movie is almost as silly as Aliens vs Predator and the script is not so smooth (Aliens vs Predator could get a 1 from me, but I want to see it again before I commit). <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous, but deliciously twisted. If you've read until now, you really need to know ... A group of extraordinarily unscientific scientists includes the main characters. Many of them are heroes - a species - but one is (obviously) crazy and rather perverse. This mad scientist invents a ridiculous nuclear-powered robot (which somewhat resembles the tin man of the Wizard of Oz, but has a human face inexplicably placed in his head). An Aztec mummy, discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife happened to be an Aztec princess in a past life (don't ask), is opposed to the robot for the great "climax": the only scene of combat is enough to put watcher of the most stoic film on the floor in belly laughs. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, given the budget and the absolute nonsense of the script, this is a movie of monsters with goof low budget balls very funny. If you like this kind of thing, try it.
