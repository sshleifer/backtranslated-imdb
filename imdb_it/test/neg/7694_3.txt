what a pity our first movie is so bad .............................. hello, what did you do in this movie: ( ... it's horrible! and the director :( .. there isn't a story in this movie. I slept when I was watching this movie .. It's a disappointment, and most of the crew is not from Saudi Arabia. It should be a comedy movie, but it lacks essential elements in Comedy, <br /> <br /> I know it first experience of cinema in Saudi Arabia, but I expect better from Kaif Al Hal !! The only positive in the film is the presence of some talented actors who didn't help a lot of text to explode their talents Finally, I want to know your comment on this movie guys ... is it bad or what?
