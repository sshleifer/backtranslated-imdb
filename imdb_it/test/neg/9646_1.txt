Generally I like the work of Sion Sono, but this film has been completely delayed. But unfortunately, not late enough to make it pleasantly retarded. I sat there, open-mouthed, wondering when it would be over. The plot makes only a whisper of meaning. I think it was meant to be campy. I mean, the haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But humor, as it was, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. It's not bloody. I would say that maybe I was a hired hand for this project, but it seems he also wrote this boring junk. I have yet to fill another couple of lines, what else is there to say? I suppose I could end up saying: Better luck next time, Sono-san.
