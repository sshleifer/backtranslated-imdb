Telly Savalas performed a passable (but no better than) performance by Pancho Villa, the notorious Mexican bandit / revolutionary in this story of the Villa raid on the city of Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. Villa is not really a historical figure that I I'm too familiar with, so I won't say much about the historical details of the film. As a film, this is not exceptional, although it has a smattering here and there of action and humor. Chuck Connors' performance when Colonel Wilcox, commander of the American army base near Columbus, hit me a little over the top, and Clint Walker in the role of Villa Scotty's Gringo partner didn't really do much for me . The film is obviously a fairly low budget effort with limited technical quality. For a film with a run time of just over an hour and a half I have to say that this film was dragged to places, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. The Villa raid in the United States was an interesting historical cross-section (if anything, not particularly important), and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4/10
