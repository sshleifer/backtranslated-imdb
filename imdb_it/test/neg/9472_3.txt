An old Roger Moore is still back as Bond, this time trying to find out why Agent 009 was killed, and why he had a falsge of a Faberg√© egg with him, and where he came from. He ends up in New Delhi, in India, then in East Germany, after discovering a Russian general trying to detonate an atomic bomb in a circus, hoping that NATO will push for complete disarmament, so he can take control of Western Europe, then the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Despite the way it sounds, this is really more of a love story, I think, between Bond and Octopussy than an action movie, and rather long, but still a little fun. But there are too many attempts at humor in this; sometimes it seems that it was destined to be a comedy. Also, Timothy Dalton would have been better than Roger Moore in this, so there would have been no age difference between Bond and Octopussy. <br /> <br /> Useless trivia: the small plane used by Bond in the pre-credit sequence is now suspended in a Quaker Steak and Lube restaurant in Clearwater / Largo, Florida, USA. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 of ****
