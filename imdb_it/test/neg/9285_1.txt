I saw him late at night on a minor channel and put him on hold for a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comedian and I imagined he could be a good stand-up comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I could not have been more wrong. This concert was terrible. It was full of racist comments aimed at whites, Muslims and the peoples of India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and the philosophy of unbridled codon, clich√© (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors , can not resist the urge to preach when a platform is given We really need a lesson on Martin Luther King and the fight for civil rights during a comedy cabaret show? Then there were his flattering comments designed to curry favor with the women, making my skin crawl by listening to it. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, the show simply wasn't fun and I found it boring. I turned halfway and turned back to find out that he continued to preach or go on and on about his son's birth (there was no humor in the story of his son's birth and it was self-indulgent on his part to bore us with the details, clearly did not have much to say or would cut this section of the show). <br /> <br /> This show was rubbish: Runteldat!
