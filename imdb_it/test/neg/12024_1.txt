What about "Dead End Road" ... <br /> <br /> Let's just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed. The acting, the writing, the effects and everything in this film were simply horrendous. This doesn't even do justice! This film was the biggest piece of trash I ever had to sit on. This is also why I stopped him about 20 minutes before the finale because I personally didn't care what happened to the characters. I saw bad but this was definitely the worst. I was advertised for this because I am a Poe fan and this was just bad. Very bad. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that you can't vote for movies with negative numbers.
