John Sayles, what did you do? <br /> <br /> "Silver City" had moments when I could see the shining hope of a good story, well-designed characters, stimulating dialogue. And then those moments would soon be covered by layers of poor writing, clumsy direction and abyssal acting. I really love almost all of John Sayles' work, but "Silver City" is horrible. I had the feeling that Sayles could work on the beginning of a good story involving illegal work and industrial work. corruption plot lines, but then rushed and blocked the secondary plot that satirizes the Bush administration on it. The two stories don't really connect with each other, and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 3/4 of the film, making me lose patience with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> The other major flaw is the acting of Danny Huston. His dialogue in every scene is accompanied by a guttural grin, regardless of his suitability for mood. I hated this guy by the end of the movie, having been reminded of all the bad actors in every school play I've ever seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else, I don't know whether to blame him or blame Sayles for more. Regardless, it is the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate film. <br /> <br /> Finally in the last scene of the slender-thin end, I was disappointed with "Silver City". Sayles at his best, or heck, even Sayles al mediocre, can be so much better than this movie. Instead, see ALL his other works. This is not even worth the rent.
