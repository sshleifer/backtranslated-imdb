well, there's not much to say about this movie. it's just rubbish. very poor acting, mediocre screenplay and limping story .... well, the actress (I don't even know her name) who played mainrole, (not the blonde, but Latin) behaved well, but the blonde one played as the friend of the main character, his acting level is just like that of a high school, as are most of the other actors in the film. Moreover, even the zombies act very badly. and, the story itself really doesn't make any sense. Well, if you're really bored and you really have nothing to do, but you want to kill time somehow, maybe you might want to watch this movie, but still, there are still millions of B movies better than this shit. it's a total waste of money and time.
