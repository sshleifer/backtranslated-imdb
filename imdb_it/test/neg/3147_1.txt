I didn't see this show so much when I was a kid. And I think I only saw 1 episode involving the railways, I think because I liked trains and I still do. Even then I thought it was a baby show. Mostly I looked at Arthur. The songs are also quite strange. And I don't even think it's educational. They only sing stupid Nursery Rhymes. This is a stupid show, any adult who likes it is crazy! If you want good shows for children, look at something like Arthur, Mister Rogers Neighborhood or Pee-wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even that is better than Barney. Trust me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other Kids Shows that are better than this. I can see many of the reviews here that many people don't like this show. Now there are some mature people. I hope they bring this show on the air soon.
