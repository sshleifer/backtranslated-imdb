Of all the directors who sat behind a camera, Wellman could break your heart faster than anyone else. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. He also seemed to know, probably for his jejune treatment, not far above a Bonanza or Big Valley. <br /> <br /> Yet there is a moment, typical Wellman, that comes out of nowhere to shatter you, the death of Gable's Indian wife. She went to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly. No warning. Nada. <br /> <br /> One of the most shocking and unprepared for death in the whole cinema. Especially after having invested an entire hour of love for the lady in what appeared to be a corny western. Of course, her treatment later is borne by Wellman's total indifference, apparently, in the film. Even so it is a reminder of the power he has always had at his best.
