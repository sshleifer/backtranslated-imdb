This film smells like production line planning. It seems that the filmmakers looked at the recent hit movies and threw the spaghetti on the screen - Jimmy Stewart! June Allyson! Anthony Mann! Baseball! War! Child! Plane! - ROLL 'EM! - The film is about the age of Stewart / Allyson's interpreters; however, I am sure we should still think that they are much younger. <br /> <br /> There are messages in "Strategic Air Command" that I found curiously shocking and offensive, but I will stop with one really unfortunate Element: the happily married couple is challenged when Mr. Stewart's character takes a important decision without consulting his wife. In the most dramatic scene in the film, she calls him. It ends completely unresolved - Allyson cries her heart on their bed, and Stewart leaves her. NO discussion; he simply says that it is correct, and walks on his devastated wife. As far as he knows, he could cut his wrists. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, Allyson apologizes for questioning her husband's decision. <br /> <br /> Incredible! <br /> <br /> Follow Stewart-Allyson in "The Stratton Story" (1949). <br /> <br /> ** Strategic Air Command (3/25/55) Anthony Mann ~ James Stewart, June Allyson, Frank Lovejoy
