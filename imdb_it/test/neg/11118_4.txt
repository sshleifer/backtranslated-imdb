Without John Rhys-Davies, I have to admit that this would never even be recorded on my film meter. But despite this single fact, this is not a bad thrill, considering the low budget, low quality effects, rigid acting and aspects of the Sci Fi Channel. The effects of the blood are very convincing, and the Chupacabra seems really realistic ... regardless of what you think a Chupacabra looks like this is a good-looking Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> Apart from the positive aspects, this type of how Kolchak: The Night Stalker (Darren McGavin, remember?) meets the Love Boat, but despite the definitive cheese of this work, it still contains something that looks like a plot, and actually try to get your respect while making you laugh and roll your eyes. <br /> <br /> Although this work is in conflict, I still managed to find some enjoyment. Maybe you will too. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 5.2 / 10 on the TV scale Made 4. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 4.1 / 10 on the scale of the films from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
