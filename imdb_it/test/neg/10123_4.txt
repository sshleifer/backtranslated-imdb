I'll never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, they slaughter it when it brings it to the screen. My first thought when I saw Ava Gardner and Robert Walker were the protagonists of seeing something of the MGM that made the musicals better at the time. Boy was wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus played by Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway played for 567 shows in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway played the roles that Martin, Baker and Boles played they did on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash's musical with the book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a return vehicle for Mary Martin who recovered as the queen of Broadway after a disappointing Hollywood adventure. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that went on this show. Since he was responsible for the book, I expected to see some sparkling spirit in this production. Instead I had a rather pedestrian script, it was like the whole spirit was emptied. Doing his best to make up for it is Eve Arden who plays his usual Friday girl role with Tom Conway, but it's too much for Eve. <br /> <br /> The story concerns the dresser of the Robert Walker department store window that kisses a very precious statue of Venus that comes to life in the person of Ava Gardner. Of course when the statue disappears, Conway screams about the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person to stay with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is Walker who looks after Gardner and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I don't understand, Ava has been nicknamed by Eileen Wilson and Walker only sings a couple of lines. The song is played by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan reciting Walker's friends and colleagues. Obviously on Broadway the songs were performed by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. One might think that Haymes would have at least played the role of Walker. It was nothing short of embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Only three tracks have survived the score, Don't look now, But my heart is showing, That's Him and the incomparable Speak Low. Haymes's silk baritone demonstrated the best advantage in Speak Low, which was sung in duet by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason the texts of one of the greatest verse men of the last century, Ogden Nash, were finished by Ann Ronnell. I suspect the notorious Code was at work here. <br /> <br /> In Ava Gardner's biography of Lee Server, he mentions a brief adventure he had with Robert Walker when he had a spasm with his current man, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and didn't talk to Gardner's camera at all. I'm sure the fact that they both weren't in their best job didn't help either. <br /> <br /> We hope that some repertoire company will make One Touch Of Venus and see how Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
