Louis Gossett Jr returns to the well once again as Chappy Sinclair going to Doug Masters (played by Jason Cadieux who is looking for Jason Gedrick who wisely declined) to teach a new band of recruits but this time they discover pilots of corruption that deal in toxic waste. This is a series that continues to deteriorate with each subsequent entry, but this one has no zip or even action to make this value even on cable. Iron Eagle IV is directed with so much indifference that dog fights go off as if we were watching a playstation 2 game played by two lobotomized teenagers. It's horrible to watch and Gossett Jr who did his share of turkeys seems to have bottomed out here. And I saw Cover-Up, Firewalker, Aces: Iron Eagle III, Toy Soldiers and Jaws 3D. What is mysterious about Louis Gossett Jr is that he seems to be like Christopher Walken in his quest to do anything as long as he works. While watching his post, the Oscar win. Some of his best films include Iron Eagle, The Punisher and The Principal. Considering that the last two films have starred together with Dolph Lundgren and James Belushi, it is indeed something to say that three action films guilty of pleasure are running for his best work. Obviously Enemy Mine and Diggstown remain his best post-Oscar work. <br /> <br /> * on 4- (Bad)
