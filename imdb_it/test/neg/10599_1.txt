I heard what people were saying, but I ignored them. Having fallen to Blockbuster I took a copy of this film and I'm done. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes I was fighting to stay awake. There is some attempt to keep the film interesting, but it was just ugly. A chase of some sort takes place, but it has been a long and drawn out - the perfect time to have a snack. When this film ended, I didn't care how much it was, I just wanted it to end. Entering and leaving my room checking if it was over. <br /> <br /> The whole film is a clich√©, the characters and their relationships. The twists and turns are predictable, as is the ending. The actors have made the best of really terrible roles. All that can be said is that their clothes were beautiful, but the film was simply bad.
