Video distributors such as Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films once published low-budget horror films and shot-on-videos in a select market of cheetah that devoured them with joy. This is acceptable to me, because you could see these movies at a distance of one mile with their poor box art and bad titles. <br /> <br /> Now we have Lions Gate entering the mix, only they have decided that it would be better to suck the wise poor by putting a "professional" cover on it and charging the same price as one of their functions cheaper and professionally made. Don't get sucked by this! Sure, if you've seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 than you already know what to expect with 3 but there's a place for movies like this and it's not on a shelf in a video store next to professional features. <br /> <I am a fan of independent cinema and have seen several low budget and shot-on-video productions that were still a worthy rental, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The "acting" (if one can call it that) was abysmal. It was fun to laugh at the horrible line of reading for a minute or two, but in the end it was too much to take and became unbearable. The story is ugly, the dialogue is worse, the acting somehow manages to be even worse. The only thing that would save us would be a scene of gutting that manages to be terrible but it is a winning effect when compared to the splashes of blood after a girl has been slapped or the beheading of the dummy. <br /> <br /> It took me three I tried to pass the entire movie and I did it just because I paid good money to rent it and I felt like I had to at least finish it all. Stay away - stay away, far away from this.
