Outside Sweden it is not expected to have seen this movie. Happy you. The cast includes several actors who are an important part of the modern history of Swedish cinema. And yet ... <br /> <br /> It seems that Peter Dalle has only had an idea for about 20 minutes. Robert Gustafson is totally abused in this film, trying to copy a young GÃ¶sta Ekman. By the way, Ekman is the only actor who meets expectations. <br /> <br /> The credit that can be given is for the photo, a splendid idea using black and white. The music is OK. <br /> <br /> But overall it is a waste of divine actors and audience time.
