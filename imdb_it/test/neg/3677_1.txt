Wow .. where do I start. I rented this movie because it looked like something I'd be interested in watching. With a name like Val Kilmer who starred in this film, I thought how bad he could be? This must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name attached to it. I wondered why it slipped through the cracks and I don't remember hearing anything about it when it came out. It starts quite well, and somehow recalls the introductory sequence in bourgeois identity, but after the first 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then ventures into the land of the WTF. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't rent / buy it if you're not a masochist or try to see all of Val Kilmer's films out there. There are many other titles out there that deserve your time more. This film (if you can call it that) is a real waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.
