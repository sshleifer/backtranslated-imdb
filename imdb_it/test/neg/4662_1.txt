Being a relentless explosive and uninterrupted melodrama, this film is one of the worst action films ever made and absolutely incredible in every respect. The rhythm is constantly feverish, and all the action and the actors are gripped by a total hysteria. It is almost unwatchable, and a stain - indeed, a stain - on the careers of all those involved. <br /> <br /> The exaggeratedly exaggerated attempt to get excited weakens, resulting in a movie where you just go "Come on!" all the time. The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously. I can only evaluate this 1 in 10 abomination. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid film, see Deep Impact, which is intense, sensitive and completely engaging. All that Armageddon is not.
