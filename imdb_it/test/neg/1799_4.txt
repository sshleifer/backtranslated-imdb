The film "Heart of Darkness", based on the book by Joseph Conrad from 1899, is one with little or no detail and has an almost schizophrenic plot. If you read the book, you know that none of the important "story making" scenes were included in the film. There is so much in the book that it is left to the imagination and I feel that this is one of the parts that make the book what it is. An example would be when Marlow spent hours and days without time, even months waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the film. Again, if you read the book, then you would know that this book scene is almost able to describe the main, the theme of futility, the best. Finally I feel that the film was too cut and dry. Not enough, however, it was included in the original text and how it made history what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book, "Heart of Darkness" (preferably, the Norton Critical Edition) then don't waste time renting or buying the movie. However, if you have read the book, I think you will appreciate the book much more if you decide to watch the movie <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
