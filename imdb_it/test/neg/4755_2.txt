Really, I really don't understand how that movie could have a rating higher than 4 here on IMDb. It's simply a big mess, and I must admit that I actually liked AvP 1: close to no story, okay, I can live with it, but at least they got to the point more or less at the same time. AvP 2 no. After the stupid premise has been presented, there is more than half an hour of stupid and inadequate teenage clich√©s, stupid as hellish dialogues and close to nothing else, except for some scenes from Alien that seem like an excuse to have that first half of the movie and the Predator scenes that make you wonder if those guys who made the movie also watched any other Predator movie or just didn't care enough to be disturbed. <br /> <br /> Later, that crap-fest finally reaches the point where the Predator starts attacking the Aliens, or at least pretends to do so. And boy, that Predator is stupid, blind and deaf. It's horrible. How he managed to earn that stuff he has is beyond me. He misses almost every shot, notices the Aliens only when they are right on his face or if it is absolutely necessary for the script, so that he can move where he needs to be. He is even taken by surprise by puny teenagers and human deputies all the time. What should that guy be? After the first hour of that abomination I was more or less constantly shaking my head in every scene. Almost no scene in this film passes without incredibly stupid dialogues, stupid actions by Predator or stupid non-existent or stupid actions by our "heroes". <br /> <br /> So that thing ended. To my surprise, not only my friends and I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard leaving the room was crying half-way, laughing halfway through those 1 and a half hours they had just wasted. <br /> <br /> Don't look. Never.
