This comes from an adult who came across the first film waiting for a film aimed at children and was surprised by the adult humor that was in Emperors New Groove. The character I liked most was Kronk, so I was thrilled when I heard about the sequel (sp) with nothing but "Kronk". <br /> <br /> I just saw the new Kronk groove, it took me two days because I had to shut it down, I was so bored in the middle. In the end I saw the rest of the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was a bit lame as the first one. <br /> <br /> Being a Disney movie, I expected to have some music scenes, however this was full of them and they were not funny. The great thing I found on Emperors New Groove is that it could be enjoyed by a wide audience, from children to adults. Kronks New Groove honestly did nothing for me and my girlfriend and we both loved the first one. It's really aimed at children, the comedy is quite childish, the music scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely trivial. <br /> <br /> Save some money and rent this movie if possible because it's definitely not worthy of a second viewing. I was extremely disappointed and shocked by the way this film was thrown together. Actually they managed to make a character (Kronk) not funny in this movie, which is surprising in itself. <br /> <br /> Of course every opinion is different but I am very easily amused, I usually like sequel (sp) when others discredit them, especially since I loved the first so much I needed more than the characters and no matter how much bad the plot would have liked the movie. I can't say the same for this, I would never have thought of turning it off halfway because of sheer boredom. <br /> <br /> Buy at your own risk.
