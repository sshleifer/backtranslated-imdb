At first, the look at a control panel that reads "8 miles of the cost of California", and no, I wasn't wrong to write, they didn't really realize the cost effect instead of off the coast. These people must have been idiots. <br /> <br /> It's nice if you like terrible movies, but the simple fact that they can't grasp a simple spelling problem makes me believe that they didn't make any effort creating the movie whatsoever. Navy uniforms are by no means correct in any way. <br /> <br /> Wow, completely ridiculous, but good if you're looking for something incredibly stupid to watch. The way these people earned money is beyond me.
