It's a long time ago that I saw this movie and it's still one of the worst I've ever seen. I like many types of movies; science fiction, action, drama, thriller and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This may have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew up. I didn't want to see this movie, but my friends insisted on watching it. I didn't know it was crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino crossed Texas, killing everyone on their way (especially the liquor shot scene was excellent), but at the turning point, everything in the twister bar changed. Stupid Vampires has taken the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie has become a stupid horror movie like "Nightmare on Elmsteet". If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love blood thrillers you don't look at it at all, in the end you'll be very disappointed.
