According to most people, I know that I saw this movie and the reviews I read this had to be an extremely fun thriller that must be seen by more people. I didn't expect this movie to throw me away, but I certainly didn't expect to find this mediocre movie at best, which is what it is. <br /> <br /> I am no stranger to French films that are both French and after studying them as a student, I am aware of the clich√©s and trivial twists that can go unnoticed by the British / American public. There are some great French films that should have been given wide international circulation, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the plot is somewhat ambiguous, complicated and too smart to be funny so you really feel every minute of its duration of 2 hours and 5 minutes and for the moment everything is finally revealed that you are over the cure. The main character is devoid of any real charisma or acting talent to keep your attention fixed mainly on him and his journey anytime near the end of shit so by the time you even considered swallowing the twists main who started ticking over you that you lost time! Actually, I remember turning off before the credits started running after the film meeting - this was where I was sure I had almost lost my time. <br /> <br /> The film is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it seems completely overrated. For example, I read somewhere that beats all the Bourne Identity films in terms of suspense or even that it has "wall-to-wall tension". I can safely say that some people are proposing this film frankly boring. <br /> <br /> 4/10 is a generously thoughtful judgment for this film that I hear, and since I've seen some complete and complete stinks, I will do so and save the 1, 2 and 3 for them.
