Riccardo Freda could have a good reputation; but since now many of his best films were, in fact, directed by the late great Mario Bava; it is clear that he was not one of the most talented filmmakers in Italy in the seventies. This film practically shows it as despite the simplistic plot; it is a sprawling mess and, in general, I should even go so far as to say that the Tragic Ceremony is WORST than the yellow block of Freda, the Iguana with the tongue of fire. Freda has apparently denied this film, and I certainly do not blame him! The plot simply follows a group of kids running out of gas in the middle of nowhere. They happen on a house while they look for fuel; but it turns out to be a bad choice, since the owner is about to perform a satanic ceremony ... I have buzzing. The film plays a leading role for Camille Keaton, who would continue to play in the classic I Spit on Your Grave exploitation a few years later, but fails to make an impression here despite acting alongside a cast of talented artists. The film presents a decent scene towards the end, but this is not enough, considering that it takes eighty minutes of boredom to get there. I have a high tolerance for Italian junk movies that don't make sense - but I couldn't stand it either. Missing, don't miss anything!
