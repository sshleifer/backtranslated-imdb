I saw Wicked Little Things as part of "8 Films To Die For" by Horrorfest, and this was the only film that disappointed me. To deceive, a mother, her child and her teenage daughter settle into an abandoned house in the Pennsylvania mountains. Every night, however, the vengeful spirits of children killed in a coal mine run and massacre whoever they find. I imagine the director is pointing out that his viewers are disgusted by the fact that the children would be capable of murdering pickaxes and eating human flesh (of which there are lavish close-ups, like a nice tribute to George Romero) because the film does not it is scary otherwise. Simply put, there are too many scenes where bad kids go jogging at their next murder site. If someone catches it in the barn, there will be a shot of the children coming to the barn (oh the suspense) and then they will move for the kill. <br /> <br /> Come to think of it, why do children suddenly walk so SLOWLY when they rip their prey? And not that I have any experience in this, but I think a shotgun shot will throw a child A MUCH MORE THAN what this movie implies ...? Nor does it help the mother be one of the worst parents I've ever seen in a movie. "Is the entrance door lock locked"? You have a DAUGHTER OF EIGHT-YEARS in the woods with ORSI and LIONS MONTAGNA! FAIL, MORO !!! Also, mom and her eldest daughter seem too close together for ages, even for a teenage pregnancy, and there's an incredible death that furtively involves someone trying to push a car out of the mud with their ass. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this to 3 because you've tried. Like a splatter movie it's not bad. But for a good fear, go elsewhere.
