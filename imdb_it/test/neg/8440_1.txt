this was absolutely the most tragic pile of cinemas I've ever seen. not only was the name a complete misnomer - since the film has almost nothing to do with piranhas - but the acting is empty and stale as an attempt to achieve some sort of plot. when you watch this movie you can't help but pass every second interrogation when you wake up when you have enough and it's time to turn it off. unfortunately I waited until the end in my case. are two hours of my life that I will never be able to recover.
