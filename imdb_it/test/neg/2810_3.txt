If the rich are different from us because they have more money, then the directors are different from us because they think the world cares about their every thought. <br /> <br /> This piece of self-indulgent tripe seems to have been made only because the director felt it was time to make another film, and someone was funding it. Not all trivial ideas or reflections are worthy of a movie (unless you are a university film student trying to complete a course). When you have nothing to say, sometimes it's better to stay calm. <br /> <br /> The images are not to take your breath away. They are quite ordinary. The dialogue is inano and incredible. The words speak no one would make a sequence together in situations that go beyond the imagination. Germaine Greer's flix k without zip is finally brought to the screen. Even if you believe in love at first sight, nobody falls into bed as easily as these characters. Fuck it before you talk. Even more incredible is an old bald director who discovers instant sex with the most beautiful girl in the city, even if gravity is already coming to Miss Marceau at a young age.
