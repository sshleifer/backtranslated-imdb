This must be considered one of the greatest weakest of the Cinema. I was wandering around Europe at that time and I had the misfortune to run into the crew that made this film in what was, even then, one of the idyllic and unspoiled scenery of the world. I was drafted as an extra, and what followed was a display of modern debauchery. Forget all the accusations you've heard about Peter Mayall's intrusion on this rare piece of French life - Geoff Reeve and his cohorts have embarked on a spree level in Les Beaux's restaurant that left the Maitre incredulous. They were simply terrible, uneducated and undeserving of French hospitality.
