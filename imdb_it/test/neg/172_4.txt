As noted in other comments here, camera work is ridiculous. I'm tempted to say that the director of photography is a 7-year-old boy, but he would be bad - at 7 years old. <br /> <br /> Ok, but what about the topic? I was looking for some information on the state of the wine industry around the world, you know, Mondovino. What the film is about is a very narrow vision of an intrigue in that world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they would like to buy. There is no illuminating narrative that puts the whole agreement in context, so there remains the director's selective process and interviews with the various characters in this little psychodrama. There is no shortage of despicable characters, or even despicable dogs, in sight. However, there is a lack of impartiality. <br /> <br /> Is the director a Marxist? I wondered as I tried to maintain some semblance of focus when the camera sank, swerved, zoomed into a chaotic flourish. Small farmer in France: good. Huge farmer in the United States: very, very bad. Forget the hundreds of small wineries in North America, Australia and South America. There's a dead horse to beat here for over two hours. <br /> <br /> To learn more about the intrigue, it is best to read it elsewhere. And you can taste your favorite wine without feeling sick while doing it. <br /> <br /> I suggest a new prize at Cannes for the best American diatribe.
