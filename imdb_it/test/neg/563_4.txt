This film should have been called "The Eyes of Alexander", and should have eliminated the concept of Bogart altogether. The film began with a carefree approach to Bogart's legacy and some comic moments with his face oriented towards surgery, but after the first 15-30 minutes it turns into a more serious thriller, where two sapphires of palmar size, presumably laid like eyes in a marble headdress of Alexander the Great, for him, and seen by him, just before his death. So the gems are of great value not only for their quality and size, but also for the link with the greatest conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander qualifies me to say that it's a completely and completely fiction, but it's still a good movie. So the film winds around some nonsense and stumbles along with all kinds of Alexander's allusions both in the foreground and in the background (which I really liked), ending up with a dated shark attack (you couldn't go into a film in '79 - '80 without a shark showing to threaten the public). Is there a yacht named Euridice (the young wife of Alexander's father), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (It's been about 5 years since I saw the movie, so I don't remember all the details), Olympics, some street names and many others. It was fun to watch the film just to try to catch all the basic details that the director (obviously Alexanderphile himself) has included. When all has been said and done, the eyes are recovered and the camera opens on them on a bed as the credits pass. Kind of a clean finish. What would have been more fun would have been if they had gone to the Indiana Jones and had had an action adventure. There were many, many real artifacts that might have been used to make the handwritten (Aristotle's) version of the Iliad that Alexander kept with him throughout his life, even in his many travels through Asia (would be of incalculable value if found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite movie actress of all time) was killed too soon, and she should have been the absolute lead actress, not Mama's and Poppa's ... although she herself was easy to the eyes. If you can find this movie, it might be worth taking a look at the historical stuff and seeing Olivia Hussey in an extremely funny and unprepared humor at the beginning, but besides that, I'd send it for something more fun. > <br /> Sincerely, Nick
