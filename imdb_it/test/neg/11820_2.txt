Some of the films produced by Roger Corman's New World film company in the 1970s represent the best type of B-movie, where the limits of the genre actually act as a sort of liberating influence on writers and directors ?? these classic drive-in films like "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" emerged from this environment. Unfortunately, his former confederates at the American International Pictures were running out of steam in the 1970s, particularly in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and often produced fake imitations of Corman's films, sometimes with his own self-produced stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It's basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House with some of the same stars doing many of the same things. Yes, this is a co-production by John Ashley (yes, the same John Ashley who was the fun Elvis who wants to be in "How to Make a Monster" and paired with Debbie Walley in "Beach Blanket Bingo") with all the distinctive signs of her productions, the female prisons where all but the 2 or 3 main characters including prisoners and guards are Filipino actors in predominantly non-spoken roles, in which we see women of the supermodel type taking on roles as revolutionary militants, and where the main joy of the film derives from a rudimentary exploitation of S & M. <br /> <br /> The press I saw on more recent it was terribly damaged by light (good old Will Viharo described it as "Yellow Mama, Yellow Mama"), but I think that even in the best conditions photography and direction are extremely routine. he must not have had much to do with the film itself because he was always smart enough to give at least his films an extra production value, filming in free public spaces that would make the film more impressive. This movie doesn't look impressive, it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack and you just feel embarrassed for anyone who shows a bit of talent. The only remotely interesting exhibits come from Pam Grier as an exuberant whore to escape from life, the Filipino actor Dindo Fernando as his grotesquely self-indulgent pimp and Sid Haig as a cowboy-style mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low-cost female version of "The Defiant Ones", but does little with the melodramatic possibilities offered by that premise. Basically it's just an excuse to ensure that the two protagonists can still stop for a good wrestling game while they are trying to escape together. This is all in the spirit of fun, but the film eventually fails even as exploitation because there is a certain margin and crudeness that should be present in such scenes that is instead replaced under the hand of this director with a kind of yawning predictability. > <br /> So the film will have little value for fans of hard-core exploitation value ?? at least in the version I saw is no more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" for over a decade before, and much less interesting visually and thematically. For those who enjoy having a laugh with "so bad is good" movies, this could provide some fun but it's not in the upper range. People would be more advised to look for "Heat in a cage" or some of the others who enjoy themselves in their own brutality to the point that it becomes a field; this is more like the less ambitious efforts of Cirio Santiago's "The Muthers". Unfortunately, the best thing about this particular film is the title and presence of Pam Grier, who was better in other films in the same period (in particular "Coffy" by Jack Hill). This film perhaps illustrates a point halfway in Miss Grier's journey from Corman's secretary to the B-movie Queen-For-A-Day, but in addition to its historical "meaning" as such it will have little value even for the big fans of Grier because she is given very little to work with here. <br /> <br /> It's worth skipping, unless you can see it in a cinema with lots of friends and lots of beer like I did. And even then its value is questionable.
