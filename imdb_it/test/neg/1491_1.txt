I had trouble staying awake for the two-hour opening episode. It has been reduced to such a point, I doubt that it has learned one thing. The graphics were rudimentary. Every little idea has been repeated to the point of nausea. Compare it with the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan. He had a good musical theme. There was no music from these infernal 10-dimensional strings.
