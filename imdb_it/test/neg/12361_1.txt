Somehow, I really thought I would like this movie because I love images with mountaineering and a great mystery in the plot. I must say that the photography was fantastic and that some scary scenes caught my eye. I thought that Nicole Eggert, (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good night", 01 played a very convincing role as a girl who had a tragic loss in her life and meets some characters who want her to guide them up the mountain Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconvincing boy and starred in many scenes with a bad character that seemed comical. This film was a great disappointment and not worth watching, unless there is nothing on TV to ENJOY !!
