Julien Hernandez is certainly an attractive and nice character on the screen. In fact, his character brings pretty much this whole movie, or what it's worth. The problem is that, with the exception of his street friend (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / boyfriend for some of the characters) no one else even comes close. Hernandez plays a 30-year-old director, a Cuban legacy and an unknown sexuality, who comes from L.A. and get a job doing a gay documentary. In the process of meeting a group of gay people while finding subjects, it comes out ... but most likely. Even at 88 minutes, the film was obviously lengthened and filled with various film school devices, most of which end up needlessly interrupting the narrative (which is not so much to begin with) or to highlight the overall amateur of the making of the movie. <br /> <br /> Which is a shame, because there is a love story here somewhere, and the last three minutes, when Sebastien of Hernandez finally clicks with a rich West Hollywood party-launcher (pleasantly underrated by Lonnie Henderson) and they share some sexy and sentimental kisses, it works despite everything that has happened before. But we don't really care about any of the other characters or their situations: why does the beautiful Dante have a Eurotrash shit for a boyfriend? He wouldn't do it. And don't even get me started on the "rules" of Sebastien, my friend Paulie, for appointments - no gay man I know, hell, no sane person, period, would put such constraints on himself or others. And please tell me how does Sebastien get a peeled banana (which is usually pretty crappy, right?) Stuck in the ass and have to go to a doctor to remove it? <br /> <br /> I noticed that Hernandez won a prize for this film as a "short film" - it probably should have stayed that way. That being said, I would look forward to seeing Hernandez on the screen, in a better script with a safer direction.
