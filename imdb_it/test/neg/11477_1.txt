This is absolutely the worst comedy I've ever seen. It's hard to explain, though, because (unless you've seen it) I bet you never saw a play that was neither good nor bad; it's just there (this is the original part, not good or bad, just there)! <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that I've seen every comedian appear in a lead role and like all of them. This is what makes this such a mystery. The support leads are actually acting (even if the dialogue is bad). The only character that is good enough is the one played by John Goodman. He does a good job with what little dialogue he has, and actually has a funny line (I won't ruin the only funny line in the movie, in case you decide to look anyway. It's a pancake.) The great mysteries are the main conductors. I will not call them characters, because no character has been developed. This screenplay is so young that they don't even bother to name the fiction. Everyone uses only their own. They don't even seem to try acting. It is as if everyone was reading aloud from scripts that the young local junior sent to them. I actually wrote a sheet like this for my English lesson when I was thirteen - it wasn't even fun. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, don't worry about renting this. It's not funny. It doesn't even have the kind of bad dialogue you can complain about. I sat there and looked through it all. It was so boring that I couldn't even feel irritation at how bad it was. I can't imagine how this is even worth a score of 4 here.
