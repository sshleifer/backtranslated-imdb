This television program is a stupid waste of time if you want to learn about animals to look at the discovery channel. If you want to watch <br /> <br /> nincompoops on television, look at MTV. MTV is synonymous with television music <br /> <br /> not nitwit D-listers who preform late skits or kids who cry <br /> <br /> their hearts for not getting a BMW for the sixteenth birthday. I bet you <br /> <br /> if you like this show, I bet you like Bam alive and jackass huh? I think my IQ lost ten points watching this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two jackass shows and the animal planet <br /> <br /> Some think this is a good combination. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, you think I'm retarded. <br /> <br /> And if you notice that it is very similar to Jackass <br /> <br /> and live the Bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is horrible
