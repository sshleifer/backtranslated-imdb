Frankly, I am amazed to see that this film is getting relatively good reviews. I will be completely honest and I will say that the only reason I passed him is because of Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons particularly related to his skills as an actor, although I think he has been a better actor over the last few years. his first major roles in the late 1990s. <br /> <br /> With regards to action / suspense films, this film fails in almost all aspects. The acting is OK, I suppose, but the script is absolutely horrible and makes little sense, a fact that the directors try to hide by adding absurd references to the Chaos theory, as if it could convince anyone that the film is actually 'intelligent' - but then again, judging by the other reviews, some were. Don't be fooled: the script is a boring and derived mess and no other element of the film compensates. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in a film, and Statham is a deeply boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
