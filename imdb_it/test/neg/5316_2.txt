Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was fun and had the perfect balance between highly comic acting and serious plot. Be Cool is like an economic knock-off that tries to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten he was ever in the crowd. It sounds like it's a bored film run, rather than a run-down of a bored movie that was Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in almost all the roles she has played, is tense and confused. Should he be smart or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and uncomfortable. In addition to this, simply add all the movie clichés you can imagine. A well-mannered rap producer of Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good pipe set in Christina Milian, an aspiring black dude in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid cameo of Stephen Tyler's celebrities. The only fun part was the Rock, which invents its new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT DOES NOT MEAN. Get Shorty was smart with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film proves it with about a million different characters. And Chili doesn't even seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different film, much worse.
