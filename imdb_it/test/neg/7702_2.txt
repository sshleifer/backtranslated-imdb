The problem with this film, like so many other films that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so blurry that it gets messy everywhere. What is the story here? OK, it's a biographical film but I think everyone will agree that it's not possible for an entire life to be condensed in about 100 minutes. Some selections and modifications are required but this script has not selected or changed enough. He did not make Hoffman's life reduced to one or two definable crucial moments or themes that the public could identify and, through them, "get" the greatest image of the whole man. <br /> <br /> The film wanders from being a "troubled and genius" biopic, to semi-docu / mocu mentare (using new simulated shots to match archive footage), to sub True Story Sob Stories, movie of the week (all "I'm pulling up a son who doesn't know I'm his dad" shtick "), the political theory of conspiracy, etc. etc. He never thought about what he wants to be, and the centennial Citizen Kane like narrative structure (reporter interviewing people from Hoffman's past) is soon abandoned, which leaves the film even more unstructured and flabby than it is. <br /> <br /> The film is full of moments and incidents that do not contribute to the plot and could have been cut to leave room to expand something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio beats the window screaming "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! "(" I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting! ") It could easily be cut. All that happens is that the psychiatrist says" You have bipolar disorder, here is some lithium. "And the two women in his life they say "We could see you on the weekends more often." and bang! That's all. No more mental health problems. It's a tokenistic scene so ridiculous and useless that it could easily, and should, be unloaded before being shot. The scene where everyone gets up and watches movies from the Viet Nam newsreel and Hoffman phones GOD? Useless.It tells us nothing about anything, but when it comes to a crucial moment like the drug, the film is made so much. "Hurry up that the situation comes out of the left field and makes no sense to the public. Suddenly it has to do with heroin? Where does this come from? Why? What is going on here? <br /> <br / > I, being a middle-aged leftie, I imagine to be sitting well in the target audience for this film, but I also got tired of the portrait of 'The Man', 'The Pigs', 'The Fuzz' etc. Like brutal, fit, unreflected, androids who hate the hippies. It may have been like that in the 1960s in America, I don't know, I wasn't there, but in cinematic terms it was a clumsy polemic at a cheap price. <br /> <br /> Having said all that Vincent D'Onofrio was as convincingly charismatic as young Hoffman and I could see Janeane Garofalo in anything, even reading a bus schedule, even if it wasn't fair for this part.
