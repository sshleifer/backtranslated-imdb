can someone help me please i lost the last moments of sight and i don't want to pay to see the whole movie again. I just have to where I'm in the train carriage and she says 'what about that drink now?' and smiles. what happens next? is there more dialogue or action? surely it doesn't end there? I was a little bored in the film and kept hoping it would improve. do I love Kristen Scott Thomas does anyone remember the UK television series he was in with some nuns? I'm wanting to know the name. Sean Penn was the brilliant Madonna who ate your heart! all the others, in fact, the film was a bit predictable, it was a "spot a cast of stars". the ending caught me by surprise I really thought he had burned his boats ..... if you are a fan of one of the stars it's worth watching.
