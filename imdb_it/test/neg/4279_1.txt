Here is another low quality film from the "Disney" company. There is no longer the Disney spirit. History is boring. All emotions are false. It's not cute or moving. The Disney company was at the time a sort of magical company that offered dreams to children. Now it's about making money. Shame on people who use the Disney name for their personal benefit. It is the fall of an empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
