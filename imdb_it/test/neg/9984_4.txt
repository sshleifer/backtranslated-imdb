Although its plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, "Caligula" is not made in the style of epic swords and sandals like "Spartacus" or "Gladiator". (That kind of film production was out of style in the late seventies). Rather, it looks more like a cross between a soft-core porn movie and a bad video. At least, the reduced version of 150 minutes ago. I've never seen the full 210 minute version, but judging by the descriptions on this page, it would seem closer to a cross between a hard-core porn movie and a bad video. <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a film produced by the publisher of 'Penthouse', there is a lot of naked flesh to see, and the film lovingly catalogs Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incestuous relationship with his sister Drusilla. What is perhaps unexpected by the editor of a magazine so closely associated with the male heterosexual lifestyle is that there is as much male flesh as it is feminine in the show and clearly homoerotic nuances in many scenes. The obsession with sex is balanced by an equal obsession with violence, as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass tried to kill two taboos with one stone. (It is an extraordinary coincidence that the director of such a blatant film should be called "Brass" and the writer of such a bloody film should be called "Gore"). The characters are put to death or mutilated in a variety of sadistic ways, and there is a fascinating scene of homosexual rape. <br /> <br /> Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their dissolute lifestyle, so the film's focus on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. However, I wonder if such concentration is needed to help us understand this period of Roman history. Both "The Fall of the Roman Empire" and "The Gladiator" were set during the reign of Commodus, an equally cruel and licentious emperor of Caligula. In no case did the filmmakers consider it necessary to transform their film into a mixture of "Up Pompeii!", "Emmanuelle" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and both films are artistically far better than "Caligula". <Br /> <br /> The acting in the film is not particularly bad, with some exceptions like the horribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a properly mad Caligula. (Suitable, that is, in the context of this film: the real Caligula was undoubtedly both cruel and eccentric, but historians have discussed whether he was indeed mentally ill). The big mystery is exactly why so many distinguished British actors should have agreed to take part in such junk production. In the case of Helen Mirren (the only lady of the British empire with a past as a porn star) she was probably linked to her rather deplorable tendency to alternate between the intellectual and the deranged, but heaven alone knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike other famous theatrical actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud has not always completely looked into cinema, but here he gives a dignified interpretation of the role of Nerva, a respectable and respectable old-school senator. Unfortunately, in the context of this film any attempt at dignity is out of place like a pearl on a dunghill. <br /> <br /> Guccione has clearly succeeded in his ambition for this film to become something of a cult classic of decadence. (That Brass and Vidal have the same ambition for the film is open to the question). However, the film has no success on any other level, neither as an art cinema nor as a study of dictatorship politics. Also seen as erotic it is second-rate. 4/10
