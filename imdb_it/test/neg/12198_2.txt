I saw Hurlyburly on Broadway and loved it. I don't know what happened with the film version, because it was terrible. Perhaps some dialogues that work on stage seem inconsistent on the screen. Anyway, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Acting is universally over the top. Only Kevin Spacey has it together, and it looks like he knows he's in a bad movie and can't wait to get out.
