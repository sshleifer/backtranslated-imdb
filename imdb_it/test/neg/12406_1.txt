Wong's direction is perhaps the worst ever in the history of cinema I've ever seen. This film makes my worst 2000 film, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman, which looked like an Oscar. The flaws in this film are beyond explanation. The biggest is the lack of depth. Each scene does not develop completely as if the editing room did not know how to do its job properly. It is a pity that with a cast of talents and a famous folk tradition it can be destroyed by this lack of vision. <br /> <br /> I'm so disgusted and I hope that some great director like John Woo or Ang Lee, decides to remake this film and do justice. I'm not even sure I can vote 0/10 ??
