I met Brad Linaweaver at the Florida State U in the early 1970s when he was an inspiring and inventive writer who I thought was headed for a greater glory. <br /> <br /> And that's why I rented this video. Well, well, well, time has not been kind to Mr. Linaweaver. I suppose pressures to make a living make aspirations higher. Another flower whose flowering has become unknown in the summer breeze. Amen. There is nothing else to say. And nothing else to add. A sad epitaph for a once flourishing career as stated above. But it's the price you pay for chasing shadows without a solid foundation or goals for yourself in life. Because this film has no purpose, it has no purpose, and I kept telling myself: what happened to Brad's creativity, to his once-brilliant genius? Gone, gone, years of neglect deteriorated his mind once shining.
