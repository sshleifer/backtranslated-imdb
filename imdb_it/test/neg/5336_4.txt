Before "Miracle on 34th Street", Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did this, this movie. I was going to describe it, but I can't find the words for how bad this movie came out. The subject of adopting a child and Maureen's disease are both very serious and sensitive problems, but despite this, this could have been done much better than it was. He was so extreme in his portrait that he didn't turn out to be real at all. Probably his problem started with a weak script. <br /> <br /> Another example of a screenwriter who took a novel and wrote a weak movie. (See my review of "A Stranger in My Arms.") Beautiful O'Hara has often been rented with clunkers like this, another is Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews,) which I could eventually review. <br /> <br /> If you have any emotional connection with this since childhood, you will be kinder to this rather lifeless, colorless and lackluster film. But for something along the lines of this, maybe you can find his remake of a TV movie. Must be better Must be.
