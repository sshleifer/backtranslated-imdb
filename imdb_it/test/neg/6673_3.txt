Czech cinema travels through dark times ... this film is tangible proof. Obviously Slama wanted to make a mediocre documentary on fictitious people, characteristic of their stupidity. A young and healthy boy who doesn't want to work and prefers to live in a rotting shack with an unscrupulous alcoholic aunt. Because of the idiocy of Tonik, who is only able to announce "Dad, I will not work in the factory" (I would really like to know WHY); I understand the conditions of his "home", but I'm not really able to digest the horrible casino. Cramped sentimentality everywhere. Why didn't Monika accompany her boyfriend to work abroad? Young Czech couples do it very often. And take someone else's children to live in a devastated barn ... it's too much. <br /> <br /> Irresponsible mother (badly acted by Geislerov√°), naive and stupid boy (Tonik), silly and confused girl (Monika) ... Yes, someone has already said - badly directed and recited soap opera . Actors like Martin Huba, Bolek Polivka, Tatiana Wilhelmova and Simona Stasova did their best, but unfortunately failed to save the entire piece.
