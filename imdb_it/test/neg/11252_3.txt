This film came as a huge disappointment. The anime series ended with a relatively stupid twist and the hasty introduction of a rather lame criminal, but I expected Shamballa to commit himself to reckoning. Unfortunately no. He added more holes in the plot than it was solved and more confused than he could explain. The animation and vocal acting were great, but with an idiotic plot, boring setting (most of the film does not even take place in the boring land of the Second World War rather than in the world of the Alchemists), and a disappointing end useless for the rest of his days in a world without alchemy, and drowns Winry?), was quite rather lackluster. Do yourself a favor, ignoring the last half of the anime and this movie, and read the manga.
