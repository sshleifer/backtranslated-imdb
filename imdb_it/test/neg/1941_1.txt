Does anyone remember the first CKY, CKY2K etc.? When it came to doing crazy things, rather than watching Bam Margera behave like a douchebag, a spoiled 5-year-old, super / rockstar aspirant. <br /> <br /> The show was exceptional, however, Bam's fame and wealth led him to believe that we now like to act in a childish and idiotic way, rather than interesting things, which were ex. <br /> <br /> The acts are so repetitive, there is nothing new, except annoying stupidity and proven comments ... The only thing we see is Bam Margera, so busy showing us how much he doesn't care , how much money has obtained or of any nature. <br /> <br /> I really don't have much else to say except, give me CKY2K, because Bam sucks. <br /> <br /> I like to watch Steve- o, Knoxville etc. a thousand times more.
