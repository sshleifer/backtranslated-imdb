Wow, this movie is really sucked under the normal scale of boring, boring, unimaginative movies I've seen recently. The acting was poor and robotic. The story was so bland that it could be summed up with a simple 5-minute short. The audio was so poor and dirty that it was hard to even hear it; perhaps it was unpublished by the camera from which it was shot? I'm not sure which movie the 3 enlightening reviewers were commenting on, but that wasn't it. Perhaps the director had his hand in seeing that his film received a good review, at least before the real reviews began to appear. <br /> <br /> Save time or waste time and money on this movie. Absolute aspiration!
