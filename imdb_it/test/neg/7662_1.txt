This final installment of the "Airport" series was so incredibly terrible that it took me a while to realize that it really wasn't a slapstick comedy, like "Airplane". George Kennedy firing a rocket gun out of an open window to divert the heat-seeking missiles was comic. What would happen to your hand if you kept it out of a two-speed window? You would have lost your grip on the gun and you would have had a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally exhilarating, as was the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman who went to snub George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy who introduced herself to Ernest Borgnine. Not going to happen Susan Blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, didn't get any points on her resume for this. Not even Robert Wagner. This film was so lousy that it seemed surreal.
