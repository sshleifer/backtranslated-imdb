An extraordinarily beautiful Charlotte Lewis plays a woman terrified of a ghost who torments her on the phone. Pushed to the limit of terror, Charlotte is forced to face this chilling mystery to save her sanity and her life. I can't believe that Ruggero Deodato, the director of "Last World Cannibal", "Cannibal Holocaust" and "House on the Edge of the Park" has directed this absurd piece of garbage. The music of the Goblin frontman, Claudio Simonetti, is pretty good, but the plot is painfully stupid. The screenplay by Franco Ferrini is ridiculous and does not make sense, the acting is ugly and there is absolutely no suspense. The scene where a potential Charlotte Lewis rapist is killed with coins ejected from a subway phone is more than a laugh. Don't waste your time with this piece of shit. There are much better Italian horror movies out there!
