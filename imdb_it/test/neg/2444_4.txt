Silly Disney films about a university student who accidentally discovers a potion that makes things invisible. It's not a bad idea and some of the special effects are pretty good. However, the script is VERY bad ... all the lines crash and the acting is bad. Everyone is trying to be funny and they are not. A really boring and stupid Disney movie. But it was fun to see Kurt Russell so young.
