It should be remembered that Gammera's films, like many of Gozilla's films in the first series, were actually aimed directly at children. Little Kenny and his cohorts are experiencing the daydreams of children in the audience: they manage to run and play with top-secret stuff while the adults are watching and allowing it; they can make jokes with monsters and even when the bad guys come in, they are never in danger. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Gammera's first film is an aberration because the child is punished and endangered, but the rest of the series is pure satisfaction of desire. <br /> <br /> As one critic has said, it is not a question of failed adult films, but of films for successful children.
