Well, it wasn't a complete waste. Armand was very good in the film as usual ,,, the whole Turks against the German thing was a little strange because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the film ... he bothered to go back and check .. the central theme speaks of the killings in series with the whole gang war aimlessly. I have never seen a film in which the characters seemed Italians, presumably Turks, who took English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The highlight was the most intriguing part and there are parts that still didn't make sense to me. In any case, if you have nothing better to do, you can watch this movie ..
