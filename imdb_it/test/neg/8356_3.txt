I have a question for the writers and producers of "Prozac Nation": what is the main cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In Christina Ricci's moving performance as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a success story, just one of self-destruction as we watch Liz bring misery to the lives of anyone who comes into contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible reasons for Liz's unhappiness. But none of these superficial explanations is satisfactory. <br /> <br /> At some point in the film, it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz take responsibility for her life and her problems. No light was shed on what the film claimed to be an uncontrolled problem in "The United States of the Depression". In the story, Liz had a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a considerate roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boy (Jason Biggs) and a worried but worried parent (Jessica Lange). In a key scene in the film, Liz lies in a hospital bed watching the breaking of the Challenger space shuttle. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz's life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for its healing and healing. <br /> <br /> This film reminded me of a generic "victim" movie made on the Lifetime network cable. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the sincere performance of Christina Ricci. Real life Elizabeth Wurtzel has obviously found the resources to face her depression and become a successful author. It is a pity that the film cannot offer us even the slightest glimpse into its courageous spirit.
