The sound is terrible, the image is worse than worse, the acting is horrible, the leading actress is plump, and the story is ... wait a minute ... There's no story ...! The plot is really bad and the film's title is misleading. If you expect to see Piranhas, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with the 1978 and 1981 Piranha films. Actually, I can only think of a scene involving Piranhas. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about this movie, besides the fact that it only runs for about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It is written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "Love all the things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie. It's so ugly that it's not even fun to watch. I fell asleep after the first 20 minutes and am the kind of person who looks at everything.
