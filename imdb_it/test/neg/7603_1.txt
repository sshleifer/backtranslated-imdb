Unfortunately this is not one of those films that at least make you laugh at their incredible stupidity. It has no entertainment value. It just sucks. I don't know where to start explaining how much this movie has bothered me. I think what really takes the cake is the unbearable soundtrack. It seems that someone made a simple heartbeat and then, for the rest, he let a 5-year-old boy go wild with a synthesizer and record it. It is really so terrible and to make matters worse, there is no scene in the film without "music" (= noise). At the end of the film, you are deaf or have cut your ears off before. Which at least would keep you from falling asleep, since nothing is happening in the film to get your attention. Only a lot of bad acting, few economic and unconvincing killings, no history (jump from one scene to another and you as a spectator can try to understand something) and in the last 30 minutes or so can witness some of always. It's extremely boring. Don't watch this movie! You could do something a lot more fun like fixing a wall or reading the phone book. Did I mention how much the soundtrack was sucked in?
