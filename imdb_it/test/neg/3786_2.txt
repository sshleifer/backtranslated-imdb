The most impressive thing about 'Anemic Cinema' is the title: an anagram that is almost a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English, since in "anemic" Britain is written differently. <br /> <br /> I have always found the amateur Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be profoundly pretentious, and I never understood why his work attracts so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by chance, and which are just photographic prints in direct contact), his only contribution to culture seems to be the first photographer to represent female nudity in a way that was accepted as an art rather than a porn . But surely this had to happen eventually, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> In the early 1960s, the second season of "The Twilight Zone" opened each episode with a shot of black and white rotating concentric circles. There is an image in 'Anemic Cinema' that is so similar, I wonder if 'Twilight Zone' has borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral. In fact, if a film ever existed that deserves to be described as a spiral, this is it. In the whole 'Anemic Cinema', we are treated (?) For the shooting of a revolving disc containing words (in French) that move in a spiral. The effect is dizzying, and the texts - on incest and Eskimos - are almost Dada in their lack of meaning. I laughed at a clever pun. <br /> <br /> The emperor is naked, people, and this film has just a score of 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!
