A crime thriller of the "B" crime of the early 1950s, the story is droll, the wooden characters, Allison Hayes and Abbe Lane are the only two sexpots that make it an eye-catcher, but a short shot, only a few long frames , shows an "el" train crossing the river on the State Street bridge, the Pullman-built 6000 series cars painted with their original 1950 paint scheme, since they were delivered when new in 1950. For traction enthusiasts like me, that short take makes the photo useful. I think movies like this, Ulmer's DETOUR, D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien, THE FUGITIVE with Harrison Ford, and others from the noir genre of cinema, (big dramas about city crime) make it interesting if only for the fact that I know Chicago and San Francisco intimately and recognize most of the way positions. Otherwise it's a boring movie really boring!
