I'm so disappointed with this movie that I can't express it. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke with the all-leather face and that guy from Third Rock From The Sun who acted like I was a psychopath. I thought, wow, this will be a winner, weird Natural Born Killers style. And it went better. The value of the production was exceptional, the direction was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great, and the plot was, well, the plot, well, what to do? About halfway through the film I was tearing my hair out screaming "What the hell is going on?" and do I mean literally? Nothing makes any sense. Anything. Anything. Anything. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
