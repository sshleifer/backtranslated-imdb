I can't believe I spent almost three hours of my life watching it. This must be one of the most incredible, predictable and shoddy television movies I've seen in a long time. I was hoping for some special effects and actions, instead I spent the whole time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is superficial and obvious, the acting is sometimes tense and as the story moves, it's not funny how everything happens at the same time ... Not to mention the obvious and nauseating ending ... Now I've seen more of the part of catastrophic films, I'm a big fan actually, and I think they can often pull off completely unrealistic stuff until it's done in a fun way, but it's definitely not like that. This is just an insult to intelligent viewers around the world. What were they thinking when they made this film ?????
