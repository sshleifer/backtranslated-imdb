There are interesting pieces here and about the tastes and dislikes of Bruce Weber. Perhaps if a professional editor had put it together for Biography, I would have felt more satisfied. Instead, I spent $ 8 on a film festival. For an autobiography, Bruce Weber reveals almost nothing, apart from the fact that he likes to look at photographs, photograph interesting people, especially beautiful teenagers and listen to jazz. The director of "Crumb" would have made a much more interesting and cohesive film.
