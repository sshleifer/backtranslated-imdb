I walked out of the cinema after suffering this movie after 30 minutes. I left two friends attacked by a fat guy to endure the rest. <br /> <br /> As soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, I felt that something was wrong and it was not long before I stopped myself from hiding under my ass and I feel embarrassed. I'm not one of those who come out of the movies, though they may have some ransom, but this has suffered from a catalog of bad direction, bad acting (the character of the bar "Bruno" and the impeccable Jean Rochefort - according to my friends) , horrible editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and correlation of images that seemed to create an art by placing the peace of the wrong music on the image and the scene at the wrong time. The worst crime was his general insipidity and the unbelievable (a result of the atrocities mentioned above). Why was it so terrible? I don't want to waste any more time explaining. I would say to go and see it alone but I don't want to fill the boxes of this project more than necessary. Oh, the projection had a saving feature: my friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with the umbrella hooked on his arm as he tried to stabilize - more pathos, tension and entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 minutes of this sadly terrible effort.
