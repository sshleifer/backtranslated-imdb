The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fights against the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the whole movie. The rest of the film unfortunately is finicky, highly unrealistic and a repudiation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Even the ending sucks. <br /> <br /> Some moments like the scene in which Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese couple Twins: Charlene & Gillian) fight for a teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy. The plot is also lame, surely they could have invented something more frightening than a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts though. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable with their comic roles. However, the beautiful pieces end there. Charlene & Gillian (from Twins) have never been able to behave well and bore you to pieces and the role of "the friendly but rude vampire" has unfortunately been entrusted to Edison Chen, a boy without talent. <br /> <br /> Evaluation: 4/10 -
