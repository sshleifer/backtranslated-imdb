This film is ridiculous. He's trying to be a comedy but the script is horrible. The whole movie is done in low light conditions and you can't understand the fact that it's a comedy. It's really bad cinematography. You really have to sit there and watch it to understand that there are some jokes here and there, but in any case they are all jokes between them. This is more like a drama that has gone wrong. It's really a useless movie. Their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster that nevertheless reveals itself in this way. Unless you want to get bored out of your ass, I suggest you stay away from this movie gag.
