I really liked the movie. Sometimes it was really bad. (They destroy the villain with the hair dryer - but where are they inserted?) It's a unique film, and I liked the acting of Courtney Draper and Tamara Hope. I also liked Fanuel (however you write it ...) enjoying the character of Megan because she called him a dweeb. In addition to acting, the "rewind" and the demonstration of what happened on Ariel and therefore on Megan's point of view was quite interesting. I saw him twice and I would see him again
