Good idea ... shame about the movie itself. Would he have liked it to be a little scarier and to explain more about the characters and who exactly was the bad woman? If she was torturing those kids because they were helping her kill and not helping others kill her? He came down from Malcolm in the Middle! <br /> <br /> I think it would have benefited from being slightly longer and going into more detail with the characters, although after about an hour I was wondering when it would be over !! <br /> <br /> It would have been better even if the real characters who killed them were not computerized in reality, this made them look disgusting. And what happened to the character of Frankie Munitz? He fell into a bed of wild roses so it should be safe, but the computer game showed him as a finite game, that is dead. The next thing that appears with that irritating blonde girl to save the guy who is afraid of the fire that, I noticed, had no problem launching the lighter when the demon lady followed him !! <br /> <br /> Too many inconsistencies in this movie to really have fun, however, you might think twice about playing that new computer game !!
