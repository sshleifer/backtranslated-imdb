First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a teenager, so all this is commercialized with me, and I can safely say that iCarly is a very poor program, and the fact that it is accepted by both genders confuses me. It contains some of the worst comedy attempts I've ever seen with mediocre acting. The alleged humor within the show is all based on repeating the lines of someone with poor sarcasm, poor sarcasm, to say bad jokes and, well, you get the picture. Also, I should mention that I still watch Spongebob, which I know will get a negative backlash, but it's quality programming with some honestly fun moments, unless we forget something iCarly misses; WIT. The show is about a girl, Carly, who puts on a web show with her friends, which I can say without doubt a more beautiful version of the internet. Okay, but the show is just ... well, it's not funny at all, as stated earlier. If this is what children's programming has arrived today, parents show them something that is REALLY fun; Spongebob or Rocco's Modern Life would work. <br /> <br /> Also, compared to his brothers show, Drake & Josh, it's terrible, which was implicit. Seriously, please look at something worthwhile. He is also poor for a children's show.
