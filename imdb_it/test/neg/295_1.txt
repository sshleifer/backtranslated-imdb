OK, imagine that every state in the United States, indeed, every country has exactly the same trees that grow and grow in foliage. Imagine, moreover, that the field of a hunter of monkeys, so far from the beaten paths, that you had to do for the first half of the path along the river, has a beautiful perfectly paved road, perfectly straight. Imagine a world in which you have to wear a complete biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk, then throw it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket without caution as soon as you get back to the office. A world in which two nine-year-old girls are happy to give a lot of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this film is set. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, it is one of the most banal excrement pieces that has been my misfortune to assist in many years. <br /> <br /> I liked it. :)
