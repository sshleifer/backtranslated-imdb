Jerk hazer Mike (David Zelina plays this college frat boy as one of the main bastards you want to see die right away) and his college friends leave hypoglycemic diab Sam (Caleb Roehrig) hanging from a wooden cross with this scarecrow legendary ghost story. They get PO from Sam who essentially lets himself be surprised and points a swinging fist at Mike who lands on his girlfriend, Patty (Kristina Sheldon), instead leaving the poor hung boy is his punishment. Somehow, Sam's soul "emerges" with the inanimate scarecrow that comes from the cross to destroy all those who left the poor boy there to rot. Mike and the band send the ducks back, don't start bringing Sam down, but they're the first to get a swinging blade through their throats. Mike and his posse head to the beach to sip alcohol, play volleyball and squabble until the scarecrow arrives to finish their little night. Sam's replacement brother, Jack (Matthew Linhardt), should watch him, but instead decides to go to bed with Beth (Samantha Aisling), a new loving boyfriend. So when he gets a message from Mike on his cell phone about how they left Sam hanging on the cross while they were sunbathing on the beach, Jack is full of fear. Beth's estranged father is a doctor and agrees to see after Sam's condition after they cut the young man almost dead to take him to the emergency hospital. Going back to the beach to face Mike because of his negligence (.. not to mention Jack's promise to coach Ramsey, played by UFC fighter Ken Shamrock, regarding the non-poisonous), Jack and Beth will face the same straw killer who is slamming the others out. Coach Ramsey, who was part of a past poisonous incident that went wrong causing scarecrow dissatisfaction, must personally face some demons while informing the survivors of the group of what they are facing. <br /> <br /> Girls, tits and blood..this gesture follows the basic slasher guidelines. Still, this film also brings the typical slasher traits of trivial characters, acting, dialogue and general plot. The film shows signs of its low budget, particularly in violence, since most of the real action takes place off the screen instead of showing that it is happening, close and personal. What appears on the screen is largely a consequence of the killer's revenge: a man holding his guts, another with a stake (which supports the group's volleyball net) throws itself across his chest, splashes of blood after a woman is hit on the head presumably with a big rock, a chick that lies dead after the scarecrow hit her with an SUV, etc. There are also some dubbing problems where it is clear that the sounds of their voices often do not correspond to the movements of their lips ... in particular the involuntarily exhilarating sequence in which Ed (Travis Parker), aspiring rock star, is singing to his friends a horrible song with which everyone seems very impressed.
