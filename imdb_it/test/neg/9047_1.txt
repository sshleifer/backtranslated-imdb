A snore gore. I saw this piece of horrible, smelly, useless, junk at the Cameo Movie House (now the famous Crobar Night-club) on Washington Avenue in South Beach in 1980 or 81. I was 17, and my three friends and I laughed in this horrible , lousy, piece of garbage. The theater was at its last legs and there were mostly drunks who snored and slept in the place. They haven't lost a damn thing. The Worst always acting. These actors deserve the Oscar for the worst, and I mean the worst acting roles in the history of cinema. Joke it was, the theater was showing another Mi Mi Lay (A great name at least!) Stinky ... city of the gleam. Enough said. If you are under 12 you may have some thrills. More than 12, you'll snore after the opening credits. It is simply incredible that anyone has spent a penny to make this film. And to think, it is considered a "cult" classic. HOW DISGUSTING!!!!
