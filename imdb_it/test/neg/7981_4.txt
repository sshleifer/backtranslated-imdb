Recently I was in a theatrical version of this comedy. And, on the last day of the race, I was excited to see that he would play on TV. I attached a tape because it was late at night and I watched it the next day. I must say I was very disappointed. The film's actors have made some of the discoverers that are in the script. This is understandable as the rendering process is probably different, but it was shocking to see. Much of the original script was also changed for the film to make it better for the screen, but I'm not sure this helped the film. I gave this 4 stars just because I know the script and the writing is much better than the one this movie portrays.
