Carlos wants to make fun of affirmative actions, racial stereotypes and related topics in his show that makes him very similar to the Supreme Court of Justice Thomas. He is there WHY of his race and then he denigrates it. You can presumably make fun of the Mexicans to no end because he himself is Mexican, and I too would argue that he can get by by making fun of mentally challenged people because any layman can say he is not the sharpest instrument ... even though he it's definitely a tool of some kind. <br /> <br /> He is a hacker comedian who, even with a staff of screenwriters, cannot put together 3 minutes of genuinely fun material in a 30-minute show. I can't think of a single comedian who is regularly on TV that Carlos can hold a candle except perhaps Larry the Cable Guy (not too surprisingly, he also has a show on Comedy Central to satisfy exactly the same audience without a doubt. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the greats, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, etc. talking about comedy, you really have a feeling for the amount of work and thought that goes into developing a fun and interesting comic voice. work was completely ignored by Mencia, his comic voice is partly stolen from other better comics and partly hidden by his propensity to scream his racist tripe not too toned and parched. Mencia's show is loved by some "at least me 'Suck that bad crowd' that I firmly believe I watch him for feeling better from his rants about the madness of the company, unfortunately Carlos and his fans are part of the problem not the solution on this esto topic.
