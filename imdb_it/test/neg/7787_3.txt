This film is a perfect example of how to tackle a fascinating subject, elaborate 25 minutes of substantial material and extend it into a six-hour borephora similar to the form a documentary might take if Fox's news decides to create one. Even the participants in this hatefully obstinate film cannot hide their laughter at the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great moments in the history of the world where people take a stand and work to create a better world. If only the creators had talked to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they might have come up with something slightly clever instead of this cure for insomnia.
