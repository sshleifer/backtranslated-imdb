I thought this film would be a disgrace to the series. After all, part 3 wasn't up to part 2, and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humor was not so witty in this as in the third part, but it was fun enough to make the film worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The female part was pretty good. She is a lost teenager who needs guidance. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That her aunt simply agreed to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man he just met. Of course, he was a friend of his brother. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the monastery. You might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was fun. He showed that they know how to have fun. Now, if these were monks in ancient China who danced to pop music, it would have been another thing. <br /> <br /> Probably the smartest part of the film was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks didn't want to kill a bug Miyagi told her that the street gangs that kill each other are stupid, nations that try to destroy each other are stupid, but having respect for life is not stupid. Miyagi expressed such wisdom also in other films. <br /> <br /> I give this film 4 out of 10. Of course, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as fun as the third part, and no character could ever live up to Sato in the second part. This film has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it's worth seeing once.
