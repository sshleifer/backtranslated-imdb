I absolutely hated this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. It is the only film in which I ever went to the theater. My mother, my father and I looked at each other during the film and we knew we were wasting our time. This film has stolen about 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous. The whole premise was too deformed. Being 9, I was always easily entertained. This film showed that I could not submit to anything and continue having fun.
