At the beginning of "Loggerheads", three pairs of apparently unrelated characters are introduced. To make things even more confusing, we are informed (via on-screen titles) that the action takes place in three separate timelines (between the years 1999 and 2001). It takes a long time, but in the end we get to see how the three couples are related: Mark Austin, a 20 year old gay and HIV positive guy is estranged from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. <br /> <br /> Mark is now a vagabond and arrives in Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town, where he meets George (a sensibly played by Michael Kelly), a gay motel owner and eventually gets they involve each other. Meanwhile, Mark's mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) has reached the point in her life where she decided to find the son she abandoned for adoption when she was 17 years old. Similarly, Mark's adoptive mother has also decided to follow his estranged son as she misses him (despite the doubts of his homophobic minister husband). <br /> <br /> The 'Loggerheads' tell us that it is based on a true story and that perhaps it is its Achilles heel. The director / screenwriter Tim Kirkman tries too hard to create scenes full of dramatic tensions where there is very little to find. Take Marco and George, they are both sensitive souls who have little to disagree with. There is slight tension when Grace confronts a director of an adoption agency that is prohibited by law from providing her with any information about her lost son and a slight conflict with her mother who denies disapproval when she became pregnant as a teenager. No spark flies between Elizabeth and Robert, since the good Reverend has insisted from the outset that he has no intention of reconciling himself with his son. <br /> <br /> 'Loggerheads' is similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' in the sense that the gay couple is good people and straight males (for example, the Kure Beach cop and the reverend) are the bad guys. The biggest disappointment of the film is that there is no interaction (and therefore no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his "mothers". Mark is already dead before his birth or his adoptive mother have a chance to reconcile with him. <br /> <br /> Kirkman's theme is both a request for tolerance and a call for family members to express their sincere feelings before it is too late! Kirkman's feelings are mostly well-intentioned, but they don't represent good drama. Loggerheads moves at a snail's pace without providing new revelations (or suspense) on topics such as AIDS, adoption and homophobia. Ultimately, the 'Loggerheads' fail due to lack of originality.
