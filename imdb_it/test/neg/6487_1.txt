The alleged "queen of screams" Debbie Rochon and her group of border prostitutes head west to the place of the title and encounter gruesome murders that turn out to be the work of a cult of former confederate psychopaths who try to resurrect the south through a useless massacre. > <br /> The action and the suspense take over a lot of boring dialogues and the uninteresting development of the character. <br /> <br /> Billy Drago is good at the ungrateful (not to say useless) role of the city killer, but everything else about this sought-after western slasher is extremely poor, including the city and the fort, both appear modern traps for tourists and western customs that seem to have been purchased in Party City. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a big favorite and watch Ravenous instead.
