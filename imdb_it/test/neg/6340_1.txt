It is sad to say that a film is really horrible and one tries to find a way to say this. However, this is a terrible film. Gene Hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) in revisiting his most famous, and often recreated, role as "Gene Hackman". Otherwise, television actors have the chance to become movie stars and successfully resist temptation. Patrick Swayze has a minor part and has continued with bigger things, so he must be eternally grateful. <br /> <br /> I saw this film as a result of someone else's review, and I felt that another point of view was deserved. You may not agree with my review but now, at least, you've been warned.
