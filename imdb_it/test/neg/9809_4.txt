Rather twisted Horror film, which has some good moments here and there, with some disturbing scenes of blood transfusions, but it's too boring because it's all right. All the characters are OK, and the story, while having great potential, is rather boring, however the blood transfusion scenes seemed frighteningly real and, consequently, they were extremely disturbing. It is well done and written in a decent way, and it started out very interesting, but could not keep up, I also found the ending to be disappointing. Linnea Quigley no longer has a very small role in this, so I was disappointed with that too, and Stephen Knight did a good job as a protagonist, since he was quite twisted, plus I got this in a Horror DVD set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a number of other horror films. There is a lot of blood, but it is not so bloody, and due to its small budget it was done quite well, however, as I said, it could not support his interest. This is a rather twisted horror film, which has some good moments here and there, with some disturbing blood transfusion scenes, but it's too boring for its sake, I'd like to pass, but I think it's worth looking at if not you have nothing better to do. The direction is OK. Elly Kenner and Norman Thaddeus Vane do a good job here with good photographic work, and they do a good job on a low budget, but the pace is too inconsistent for my taste. The act is actually okay. Stephen Knight is great as a protagonist, he was creepy, twisted, sick, and made a very disturbing performance, the most gruesome thing about it even though he seemed like a normal person. Linnea Quigley did well in her small role. Christopher McDonald is OK I guess its short term. The rest of the cast is also OK. Overall, I'd like to move on, but I think it's worth looking at if you have nothing absolutely better to do. * 1/2 out of 5
