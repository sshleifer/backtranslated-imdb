First, this has nothing to do with the 18 best weapons of Kung Fu with Gordon Liu. I say this while my Kung Fu Theater presents a DVD with a totally misleading image on the cover, the wrong plot on the back and continues to mention (I don't know why) The Young Hero played by Hwang Jang Lee. Apart from an introduction to the history of the 18 style of weapons told by a monk to some children during the opening and the usual mysterious manual that everyone is looking for, the weapons never appear again and the fights are all in boxing style. The hero is Lee Shao Hwa whom I have never heard of before or one of the other actors. The film is about another director Wu Yuen Ling and IMDb lists. The other actors are Wang Fu Quen, Wang Wing San, Chen Fei Fei, Wang Ki San, Suen King Kai and Hwa Yue Suen who seem to have sunk without trace after this movie. The fights are reasonable and frequent but not great and the "star" does not have much charisma. The blow at the end is simply stupid and the movie seems to end abruptly as if they are bored with it. The scenery and training sequences in the river are a little different than usual. Unfortunately, the beautiful sister drowns not the very irritating (though acrobatic) boy.
