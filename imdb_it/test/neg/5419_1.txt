This film is BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING and BORING !!! Not the worst movie I've ever seen, on the contrary, but ....... how can I put this ....... IT'S STRONG! There is a very beautiful and a little witty scenario, but that's all. If it were advertised as a travelogue, I would classify it as a 7, but it should be a film with a plot, a bit of drama, and for god's sake a satisfying point or conclusion. <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments on this forum about this film and wondered if they had seen the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie (yawns) at your own risk ........ one thing for sure- it's really properly rated = G RATING! (Which most is going to GOD FANTASTIC EDGE!)
