Devoted fellow noir, don't be deceived, this is a stinker ... badly filmed, misinterpreted and there is nothing ... nothing here for the cinephile looking for another solid B-movie from the gold mine of the years 40s and 50s of classics I made an attempt based on the relatively high rating on IMDb. There is no reason for the taste, but I have found nothing in this film to recommend to other members of IMDb. This is a classic example of having seen a movie and feeling like I was cheated by the number of minutes that the movie took to get his grateful death. Having Alan Ladd on the cover of the DVD / tape is almost a fraud, he's been in the room for less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! This is not a gun for the people ... it is a classic in the bad sense of the studios that chop the forage without a budget ... We all look for the biggest ... save your time with Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets. .. it's very bad!
