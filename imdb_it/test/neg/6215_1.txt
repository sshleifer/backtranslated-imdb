The alleged writer and director Mr. Dhawan has copied almost the entire plot of Hollywood hit movie "HITCH" with Will Smith. Many scenes are also exactly the same. The plot was only copied and some low-level humor (probably the very creation of Mr. Dhawan) and frequent dances were added to increase the film's time to local standards. <br /> <br /> Although Salman khan and Govinda recited some smiles, it is not suitable for legendary artists like them to be part of plagiarism, especially when they keep telling people to stop buying pirated records!
