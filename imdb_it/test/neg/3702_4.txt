Science Fiction Channel (Sci-Fi Channel) films have become boringly predictable. The budget seems low, the originality and the plot. <br /> <br /> In this creation the government wants to get a group of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul with devious means to help. There are many recycled twists on the subject of evil government. black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one-dimensional cartoons. <br /> <br /> Daniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role. Bring some of the style of his character "Angel" into the role. It is hard not to notice the link that his "Crusade" character was a telepath and this is a film about telekinetics. Was it a Sci-Fi casting move to try to attract fans from the other show? Who knows. Fortunately he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> The film is definitely low cost. It reflects the current model of the Sci-Fi channels of the Canadian position, a few well-known characters, few effects and a terribly terrible storyline and character development. They seem to believe that science fiction fans will see something labeled "scifi". <br /> <br /> If you want a good telekinesis film, take a look at "The Fury" (1978).
