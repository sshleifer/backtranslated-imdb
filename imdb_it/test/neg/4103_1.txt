My friend recommended this movie to me. He should know not to watch it because my friend is a kind of video game nerd. But the name and the cover made it look good for some reason. I was so wrong. I mean first of all, what happens with their clothes? And the acting! Looks like they freed people from Barney. Except Ben Kingsley. And why was he also in this movie? He thought it was a comedy! But I must say that the special effects were quite good. But it was like the only good thing in this. I mean seriously, the film is worse than Pearl Harbor. And this is actually a euphemism. Everyone must have thought "oh, I'm paid so it doesn't matter if it's the worst movie in the world". I would understand why someone would have made this type of film if they directed, recited, produced, wrote and obtained their life without hope as best friend for shooting and editing. Probably one of the worst science fiction films of all time. A really stuck film
