This film would have been fair, indeed probably excellent, if the directors had left the interviews and separate footage of the concert. "Into the Void" is a great song, and I hate how it is best cut to go to a bizarre interview with Ozzy Osbourne. This should have been at the end of the film, or placed in a special feature. The best part of concert DVDs is to turn them on and let the music play, but "Black Sabbath: The Last Supper" is hard to put on and just let it play because the music is constantly interrupted. However, there are some strengths of this film; the concert footage, when it works, is excellent. Black Sabbath returns to the stage after a long pause without Osbourne and this film captures well: Sabbath basically breaks into fans. Fans obviously enjoy a sweet advantage in the film because they see the band live, of course, but even they don't have to endure incessant interviews that DVD viewers are burdened with. Shame on Jeb Brien and Monica Hardiman (the directors) for doing this to the film! Also, shame on Wyatt Smith for changing the film in this way.
