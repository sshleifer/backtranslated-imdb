I rented this film courtesy of Netflix, thinking I would get the 1972 version. I was speechless, looking at this new version, thinking: Gee, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had a slightly 70s sound. I was even more convinced that it was a film from the 70s, when it occurred to me (almost every five seconds) that the only thing missing between Gene and Finney was an intense hug, a full look, a passionate kiss . <br /> I'm sorry, although John Knowles himself indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship, it's painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually teenagers) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that those desires for love, union, the desire to express themselves sexually are pouring. These guys needed to connect, but they were never allowed to do so. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, despite a lively performance by Toby Moore, I never felt any of the emotions were real. I never connected to either of the boys, just because their relationship wasn't really honest. <br /> <br /> People want to live in a fantasy and think that because this happened in the 1940s, these guys could not have had these sexual feelings for each other. But I say they did - at least in the book they made, and in this film, Finney had them, almost painfully, for Gene. The "intensity" that John Knowles suggests existed between them was a hidden homosexuality, a cult of the hero, an idolatry - which, under normal circumstances, would be expressed in a sexual way. Even if these guys were repressing her, it should have been very clear, but this film doesn't suggest it. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment in which Finney, who broke his leg, is happily caught by all the other boys during a ball game. Unless they were just a handful of notes, they would know that they could never throw their bodies at him. Obviously this crushing moment has been lost both to the director and to the producer.
