Deep Sea 3D is an extraordinary insight into an underwater world, only a few have had the opportunity to see firsthand. <br /> <br /> From the opening sequence when a wave rushes towards the audience that momentarily submerges us in the ocean, the directors make full use of the IMAX format. A jelly field seems to fill the entire theater, a shark approaches us, the predators jump from behind the rocks and devour their prey. It is an underwater party magnificently captured for the eyes. <br /> <br /> Our ears, on the other hand, do not receive the same treatment. The film is narrated by Hollywood stars Jonny Depp and Kate Winslet. Both sound so ridiculous that they positively ruin the enjoyment of images. Depp sounds a little bored as Winslet sounds like he's reading a goodnight story to the village idiot. I was shocked that an actress of her status could have presented her performance wrongly. The script is pretty silly and contains very little depth. The soundtrack is full of strange and unrealistic sound effects that I assume are fun, but in reality they divert attention from the material that should have been able to speak for itself. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman has provided an excellent soundtrack that gives a great impact to the ups and downs of life under the sea, when it is allowed to play without the silly sounds of bubbles or the shrimp steps that film pepper. <br /> <br /> The film is a technical marvel but with its childish script, the boring narration and the sound effects out of place cannot be taken seriously.
