Where the hell did VH1 find the writer of this movie ??? Outside high school? This film is so difficult to be sympathetic to Michael Jackson, but instead turns it into a horrible, shabby caricature. All the lines are full of clich√©s, but surprisingly the acting wasn't bad. As usual, this is a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, jeez, I'm sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the weak script. I didn't care that Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson, I thought he was doing the best he could, but later, when he had all that white makeup, oh man, it looked really lousy! The other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Only the actress who plays Liz Taylor seemed too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress who plays Diana Ross didn't look like her at all and I couldn't understand who this woman was until much later in the movie. <br /> <br /> This film does a disservice to all those on the side of Michael Jackson, or against Michael Jackson. It does nothing to change anyone's opinion. In fact, the only opinion anyone will have after watching this movie is, oh God, this movie really, really sucks! And where the hell is Michael Jackson's wonderful music and songs? There are none to be found in this film. I still love the soundtrack of this film and will probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> Instead, this is a very entertaining and captivating movie! It's a big waste of time if you want to see something light that won't disturb your brain too much. I'll probably watch it again, because it's so incredibly bad!
