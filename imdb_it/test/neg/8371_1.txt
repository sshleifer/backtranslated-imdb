While I was watching it, I was preparing to compose a strident and fake criticism of this "movie" (actually it's a video), but then I saw that someone has already done it. I basically agree with him. But then again, it seems like a lot of effort and millions of pounds have come in, so I guess you have to give them credit for trying. However, having said that, anyone who does not already know the world of Lovecraftian and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think, ... well, I suppose, that not only is it really ugly, but it makes it absolutely meaningless. Thank God I read part of the other review ("a bit clumsy, maybe?") Which revealed that this guy also did "The Shunned House" (which seemed pretty bad, judging from the DVD box), so now I can avoid and save my mind from any further exposure to this profanation of HP Lovecraft's brilliance.
