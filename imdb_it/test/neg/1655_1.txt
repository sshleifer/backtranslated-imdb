This is one of the worst pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time. This is also my first review so you can say I have to hate this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like my serious films. I don't like Hollywood too much, I tend to like French, Italian, unusual United States or anything that tries to communicate something sensible. <br /> <br /> But it was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was quite incredible, even if the director seems to center everything on a feeling of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character has nothing to recommend him. Do you smoke from coldness or to show us your anguish? For heaven's sake, this guy is destined to be a former shady Mafia lawyer. Are we going to worry more because he's also one of the most hostile people you could ever meet? And it smokes ... so it must have deep personal issues. Psychology pop to the fullest. In the last few moments, I almost rejoiced as he was buried in the cement. The best place for him. And I thought it was the only good scene. Or maybe because he was so close to the final credits. <br /> <br /> 3. The interest completely tired and incredible for the main character of the beautiful girl. He was there simply because the beautiful girls always have strange sexual relationships with old, old people with a deep and significant personality (as shown by smoking). It happens all the time. In really bad movies, that is. <br /> <br /> 4. The rhythm was so leaden. I like slow, I like careful. But this was only mortally. <br /> <br /> 5-50 a bunch of other things I can't really be bothered to write. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
