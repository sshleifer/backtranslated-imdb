This was advertised as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a great movie in the low budget category. I thought that this movie would have been nice too, but the boy was wrong. First of all, this film has nothing to do with Crash Dive except on both submarines. Secondly, the plot can be slow, boring and, in some cases, totally absurd. <br /> <br /> This film will not attract the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during slow and boring scenes.) There will be scenes that should be used for dramatic effects that will make the viewer laugh out loud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. After overcoming my initial shock that someone would enter this and I do not know that people will not only not believe it, but laughing at the sheer nonsense, I was able to find humor in it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see MD in a good subtitle, look at Crash Dive and leave this movie lame on the shelf.
