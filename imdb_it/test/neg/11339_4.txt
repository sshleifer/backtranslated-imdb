I stumbled upon this movie on Amazon.com. I had never heard of his release, but the three reviews gave him five stars and rave reviews so as a lover of German films I bought a copy ... <br /> <br /> I must say I wasn't impressed . The production values ​​are cheap, the story is derived, the characters are less appealing and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughter. I wanted to like it, but I found it lackluster and boring. Or maybe I expected more of an independent German cinema than a gay ride on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Are there any pieces in the film that make no sense, like one of the Leather Bears trying to put Ecki in a sling, as if he also looked at it twice? Or the vindictive ex-wife who shows up at the game but ends up cheering for her gay homosexual husband? Bunkum is not the word! Well, at least it explains the title of the film in the UK, I suppose ...
