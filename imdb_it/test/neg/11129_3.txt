What a boring movie. While he had humorous parts, he was simply boring and long (for a 90-minute movie). I believe the cause was the lack of action. <br /> <br /> When I rented this film, I expected to see white blood cells fighting evil viruses, but not so luck. It was more than the virus that was thwarted and defeated. <br /> <br /> The film was promising, but since it was designed for the little ones in mind, in my opinion it didn't meet its potential.
