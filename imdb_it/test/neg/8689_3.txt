Uncle Fred Olen Ray once again gives us his "goodness" of the Retromedia in the form of this non-classic soft-core cinema. <br /> <br /> A couple of numb peanuts are out looking at the rocks when a "black hole" comes through a swirling vortex as the intelligent dolmens say. Soon a beautiful cave girl from a million years ago is on a time line and makes her way into the future. Very soon his other studied half makes his way into the future and opens a gap between the beds of the future. <br /> <br /> Ray again offers an acceptable (but barely) party that has horrible acting but decent skin. Yes, it's barely titillating but heh! If the situation worsens, it will cure you of insomnia. <br /> <br /> S10 reviews: 1/5 or 3/10
