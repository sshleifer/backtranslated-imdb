According to this masterpiece of film script (pun intended), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he presented his theory of evolution, because he made absolutely no mention of any alien intervention. For you see, the aliens have sent Chupacabras to earth and form the missing link in the theory of evolution. However, the rest of the film seems to clearly point out that the Chupacabras are a typically Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don't really know where it fits. Are they saying that all Puerto Ricans are aliens? However, it is still quite irrelevant. The only thing you need to memorize is that "El Chupacabre" is an amateur B-movie that is absolutely cheap and imbecile, devoid of tension, character development and any form of style. Several duo of people are chasing this monster that masturbates as a goat (which remotely resembles the midget version of the Pumpkinhead demon) through the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have a talented dog catcher and a novel writer, a couple of hateful cops and the seemingly evil scientist with his skillful accomplices. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, the monster can carelessly continue to devour all the Latin immigrants in the neighborhood. The monster itself looks okay and the effects of the trick on the remains of its victims are acceptably coarse and bloody. The recitations are hopelessly horrible and the headache induces. In particular, Eric Alegria is pitiful in his first and only starring role as an ambitious employee of Animal Control. Yes, it is an incredibly stupid movie, but you have certainly struggled with low-cost and less fun garbage.
