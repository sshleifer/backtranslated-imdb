Over the GW is almost a failure of a debut function, and not because it is not without trying ... In reality it is. It is a mess because it is the writer / director / technician everyman that Nick Gaglia has gone through the same cult of rehab he describes in the film. Sometimes a filmmaker for the first time, full of the vigor he gets with a thumbs up or two from other film students, is in fashion in a style that is too unseemly, insecure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story, extremely personal. , is stained in order to tell a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 when he was put on a horrible program that basically tortured and brainwashed his "patients" with crazy group scare tactics, mental psychological sessions that could last days and attitudes from rehabilitation executives that most Nazis would have done shudders, finally escaping when he was 15 years old. I'm glad it came out, although it might help if it now goes into a real rehabilitation because of its ability to make films, even if only for a couple of days, to learn things like, for example, structure, adequate lighting, fluid camera movement, subtlety with the actors and other basic notions that are perpetually lost here. <br /> <br /> It's even more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that should be shown more to the public (a Newsweek article recently referred to a similar AA rehabilitation cult). Many times one wonders if certain studies on personal characters can work better as documentaries than as narrative dramas. This is an always annoying feeling in Over the GW, where it almost seems that Gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesn't know how to communicate correctly through his characters. The character you might think is closer to him, the Bronx youth Tony Serra (Gallagher), who is brought by his mother to a rehabilitation center in New Jersey, would be closer to Gaglia, is actually much more than a being one-dimensional, where there is very little background (we see a short whim, in black and white, in his old house) and little connection with his mother (Moriarty), which has more potential than is ever set aside by a stone cold that passes his children to another. But there's a story to follow with his two-year crisis, I guess. <br /> <br /> After all, things get tough (a search for a naked cavity in the first five minutes), and it is soon clear that instead of medical care it is more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre sect religious, where the chief doctor Hiller (Insinnia) is a real leader. But soon Tony's sister, Sofia (Donohue), is catapulted into the program, and unlike the repeated moments of Tony's outrage and alleged non-compliance, she goes ahead head-on through the three-step program launched out and once released become a fugitive. Sometimes there are fragments in this fractured nightmare, where there is a woman, a 22-year-old mother who has been in the program for a year and a half and finds she has become a prisoner who is not allowed to leave, and when the father of the main brothers and pays a furious visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them, which contain some pure energy, short glimpses of Gaglia who is able to collect at least some leverage in pure melodrama. <br /> <br /> But these are few and rare moments. It is not only the characters who are not successful, who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that turn into a hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-offs (perhaps some of them, like an angry young black, passive-aggressive advisors, or even Serra's older sister who was raped by the brothers as if they had taken a hit on a joint and almost thrown into the program, would have entered into more resonance if there was more time to develop some). Is that Gaglia is so blurry in his multiple roles in his tiny $ 30,000 budget that no part of that potential talent can get. Overcome the hues, mostly with a shade that seems covered with urine), shake the DVX camera by hand as if it were an intense wing of City of God, sometimes a character will simply be framed casually, his choices of the music is like the worst possible selections from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there are even fake interviews with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky who feel as false as possible. <br /> <br /> Could only Gaglia not get any interview with the real victims he was with and resort to the aspiring artistically cathartic plan B? In short, no matter how the real life stories may please you, don't worry about seeing it at the theater, or even about the rental, unless you love the final scene with two children staring at the digital - sunset of the Hudson River with the last words of reading: Dedicated to children. Oy.
