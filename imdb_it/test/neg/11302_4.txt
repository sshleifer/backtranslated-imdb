A typical old black and white film. The dialogues are sometimes good, but too often - especially in the second part - they become naive, sometimes terribly naive, sometimes close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. The first third, with his basic information on Ladd's Gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the film. But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on Betty Field, the film becomes overly melodramatic. The ending is yet another final release; I don't know if the novel itself contains this stupid ending, clich√© or if the film's producer has made some changes to it, but I have always considered car accidents a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this plot device a million times (or if it's not a car, so it's a fall from a horse); the writer doesn't know how to end the story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic, so he adds a car accident. Boring. And to make matters worse, the incident is outrageously casual and absurd, both in terms of plot and time; plot because the lover of Field's husband (Winters) is killed by Field, and the fact that Winters rushed out of the service station into the street as if he had never noticed in the years he had lived there It was a dangerous road through his house - and, of course, the moment she comes out, he sees Ladd's car and exchanges it for Field's husband's car and then screams "I'm here! I'm here! the tragic ending like that!" "; Ladd and Field are involved in an accident on the day they prepare to tell Field's husband about their relationship. Basically, there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this incident. Furthermore, this film does not exactly help the way that Winters' husband, Da Silva, undertakes a revenge mission to kill the guy who hit his wife; in practice it does this by going around like a zombie, going from one car to another looking for scratches and acting really very badly. Both the acting of Da Silva and the behavior of his character throughout the film are horrible and confusing, respectively. <br /> <br /> Scott Fitzgerald was shocked on a couple of occasions by the way his novels were adapted for screenplay by Hollywood writers, and had died long before this film was made - he could have had reason to complain, judging by the naive script of this film. Or maybe his novels are even more foolish and naive than this movie, and have been improved by screen adaptations. Or the films are very similar to the novels. I could, of course, read this particular novel to find out, but I can't be bothered. Fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and I don't mean the way his name sounds.) It certainly wasn't Heller, Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway ?? lots of noise for nothing.
