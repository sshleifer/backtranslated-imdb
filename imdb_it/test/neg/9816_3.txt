A pig-tailed Linnea Quigley drinks milk, strips and kills her sister and her sister's boyfriend after having sex. He goes to a madhouse, makes Amy's best friend (Karen Russell) and the two blackmail the way out of a mental institution by sleeping with their psychologists (one is played by "Carol Burnett Show" by Lyle Wagoner). Outside, these two mafia princesses who hate men (!) Stop taking their medicines and invite six ex-boyfriends of slimeball into their big country house for a party where they are systematically massacred in a very bloody way by a glove , mysterious skin-killer. <br /> <br /> The horrible David Barton FX are so bloody, but so unrealistic as to take on a sort of surreal quality. The same applies to the film. The dialogue is so strange and pungent, the film so inconceivably stimulated and modified and the acting so mundane, you will begin to doubt your sanity. This film actually tries to have a three-dimensional plot and characters, but it's all so badly managed that it's almost like it would happen if Ed Wood did a rewrite of a screenplay by Ingmar Bergman! And like any good Bergman movie, this one has a mature moral to respect - Every good party needs a "boy / girl" relationship, so there will be enough chicks to "tickle your lizard". Watch it for you ... or don't do it! <br /> <br /> Linnea (the only reason I was interested in watching this to begin with) is a lot of fun in this, it has a lot more dialogue than usual and has several amazing nude scenes. Unfortunately, she also completely disappears from the last third of this film and the film suffers because of it. <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
