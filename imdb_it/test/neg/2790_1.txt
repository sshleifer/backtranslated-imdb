The first opening scene that lasted about five minutes showed the potential to become an instant classic, with a moderate to good acting, a good movie, a story that keeps the volume high and a corner of the screen a bit scary "you saw che! "(scarecrow moves). <br /> <br /> After the quick preparation of the story that was to come in the present, it was as if someone else had written and directed the rest of the "film". The next scene is a basic outline of how the film goes downhill like a runaway truck. It seems that the rest was filmed on video, with disgusting "pornographic-style actors," the set was an office of lawyers with practically nothing on the shelves or anything in the office. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing only shitty horror movies for the chance to see some naked "teen" girls, then there were no Victoria's Secret magazines everywhere, and they weren't watching for things they do Today's great horror films such as acting, terror, suspense, understanding and so on. <br /> <br /> It took almost fifty minutes for the first person to die. When he did, my friends and I were so shocked by the WORST costume of a "monster" NEVER, we whistled through our popcorn at the TV screen.
