Having lived on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I couldn't wait to see this movie. He starts off quite promising, with a superficial understanding of the values ​​and whims of U.P. life. Apparently, Jeff Daniels didn't settle for a low-key approach that would have been appropriate considering the place and the people. Instead, it introduces extremely raw humor and some wildly inappropriate elements of mystic / supernatural. Although there is a good movie about this virtually unknown region of the United States, it is NOT.
