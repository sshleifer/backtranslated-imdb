The film was due for release in 2002 and was highly anticipated due to promotions, but eventually came out in 2003 after the producer died <br /> <br /> The film is good in some parts, but overall it's not nice <br /> <br /> The scenes between Rani and Ajay are fine, but the other scenes are not well managed <br /> <br /> The film is too similar to Hollywood BOLLYWOOD and although this has been planned before is been released first, so originality is lost <br /> <br /> Milan Luthria disappoints after KACHCHE DAAGE <br /> <br /> The music is good but too many songs <br /> <br /> Ajay Devgan seems tired and his appearance gives that the film was late and his acting seems boring even Rani is good Sonali is beautiful, the rest is fine too
