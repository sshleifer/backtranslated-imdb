Ok, some other people have commented that this is not an action movie, so I don't need to take it back (even if I just did it). It's not exactly a disappointment, on the contrary, it's nice to see an actor try something different. But unfortunately, this is not one of those occasions. <br /> <br /> Now, the story: non-existent. This film lacks almost as much plot as the "Showgirls". Sure, they put an environmentalist in the middle, no, not even the environmentalist, something else, some small things here and there to please Seagal (since that's what's inside). This doesn't make a story, not even close. Now, the ending ... Even those of us who really enjoyed this movie ... the ending, you have to admit that it was a little too much, or very stupid. <br /> <br /> Now, from what I have I understand that this was a movie directed at video (at least in the United States), but this is also too good for that. This piece of garbage should have been hollow only, on TBS or Starz (late at night).
