As a reviewer of a local gay magazine, a misfortune is automatically sent to me if I happen to have a homo in it. The chicken Tikka Masala shakes in the background as I write this. I gave him my full attention for 53 minutes before I found myself yelling involuntarily - like a Tourrette sufferer - "This is the test film I have ever seen." We are coming to the emotional climax in which the son is giving a speech to his father at his wedding. Dad seems to take it pretty well. An attempted murder at this point would have at least improved the film somewhat. And made more fun. <br /> <br /> I don't particularly like Beautiful Thing, for example, but I could at least understand why other people did it. It was made with a certain professionalism and I seem to remember that he had at least a couple of good jokes. The lack of wit in this film is quite surprising - even the most mediocre sitcom will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest film to this film was fun (at least in its first 53 minutes) was the subtitled comment given to the fat and unattractive female protagonist "Look at her with her legs wide open - it's like the Mersey Tunnel". Completely lacking in intelligence and I didn't smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (maybe working in a chip shop) enjoying it. <br /> <br /> I guess it's a lottery-funded atrocity. Otherwise, I can at least console myself with the fact that supporters will lose a substantial sum of money, since even a low-cost British film can still give back a few million to someone. Seriously, if I met the most beautiful guy in the world and, returning to his place to make a sweet love, I found a copy of it in his DVD collection ("Man, I love this movie") he would probably kick me in the balls and leave immediately. And this from someone who went about six months without any of the sweet love mentioned above. <br /> <br /> Oh Lord, I hate this movie.
