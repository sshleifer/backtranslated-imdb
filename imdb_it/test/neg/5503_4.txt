The original review I had planned for this film was perhaps a little too hard, so I'll preface it with the beauty: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly suited beer or pizza movie or a sleepover, the kind you watch with a good bunch of le people when the atmosphere is light and nobody focuses on the film. The visual elements are beautiful, and it's quite funny, in part. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching him expect something to shake with all the lights out. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (This is a serious offer, anyway. The real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even to make a film "based" on a classic story, if not are you going to try staying true to the sense, touch, tone or theme of the original? Listen carefully through the lines of the badly written dialogue and you will hear the slow churn of Washington Irving toppling over to his grave. I'll even accept the Big-City Detective piece, but ... Ricci drawing the guard hexagons around the bed? Come now. Not only is there nothing vaguely similar to this in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but it is historic BUNK. I don't care which neo-pagan ax you have to grind, but in the eighteenth century "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for diabolical powers; the whole approach to witchcraft, the adorable goddess of the white witch, "an-it-harm-none", goes back, historically, to the British Invasion. (The parties interested in the true old-school pagan practices refer to "The Golden Bough" by James Frazer, if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element, cast in the context of the film, that the structure of Sleepy The Legend empty is shattered. So we end up with a completely different story. If this had been Burton's idea, I wish he had warned us in advance. Furthermore, I would like a better story to come out than the rather pedestrian one that was seen here. And he could also have abandoned Irving's claims altogether. And in any case, the film is not scary. Not once. Not at all. The deformed tree approached, but was more than offset by the laughable effect of the meow of the Hessian comedy farce. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant that she was a blonde.
