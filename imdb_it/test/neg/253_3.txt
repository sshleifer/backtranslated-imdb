I've been watching this movie twice in the last six months (the one I've been through so I don't have to). The first vision left me half crazy and stuttering. The second viewing at 5 am on a rainy morning was a little better. he screamed in agony only once. <br /> <br /> It seems that Pocona (the Aztec mummy) had hair for a certain Aztec princess who had to "keep her virgin". Obviously they exchanged death for this. (Now it's severe!). But before they are filmed, try to make us die with a shrill Aztec ceremony. Singing will make your ears bleed. <br /> <br /> However, there is the usual absurdity of reincarnation. Not to mention a treasure map on an armor and a bracelet guarded by that dented sore Pocona. This time Pocona seems to have been on a 2000-year-old bender and is after the defilers of his tomb. His moans and groans sound like he had a bad case of Montezuma's revenge (or read the script for this movie). This will make your breath smelly. <br /> <br /> An evil Dr Von Krupp seems to want the Aztec treasure (perhaps to finance acting lessons and script lessons for the cast and crew). It's called The Bat because in The Curse Of The Aztec Mummy wore a cloak-like bat, a hat and something like a ski mask on the face. Guess is better than Fat Fat Man. <br /> <br /> The bat in typical mad scientist style he wants to rule the world. He emphasizes it by rolling his eyes, laughing maniacally and chewing on the landscape. He put together an invincible robot. It looks like the 'bot was made from a garbage can, a chandelier and the grill of a 1957 Buick. This will make your eyes bleed. A company also takes credit for making this tin can! <br /> <br /> Well the powerful showdown between Pocona and the robot takes place in the new crypt of the Mummy that has been made homeless before. <br /> <br /> About half of this film is taken from "La Aztec Momia" never released in the US in its original form but in an atrocious atrocity by Jerry Warren (see my review on "Attack Of The Mayan Mummy ") and" Curse Of The Aztec "Mamma". The robot is frankly stupid as most of the characters are. If this and the plot don't make you scream with laughter, nothing will. <br /> <br /> My first impression was so bad that he would get one, but after seeing "Mayan Mummy" (which is a film that deserves to be burned) and watching "Robot" again, he gains a 3. You have to watch this without expectations, so it can be naively pleasant.
