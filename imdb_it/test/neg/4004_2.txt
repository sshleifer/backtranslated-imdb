This film is bundled with "The Colt ... They called it Camposanto" and both films leave a lot to be desired in the way of their DVD prints. First, both films are very dark, sometimes making it difficult to see exactly what is going on. Second, neither film has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie, even if "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better dub. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but for non-purists it's not a problem. These DVD problems, however, are not attributable to the original filmmakers: only the indifferent package is marketed four decades later. <br /> <br /> As for the film, it's about the assassination of President Garfield. This is a MAJOR problem, as Van Johnson looks like both Garfield and Judy Garland. In no way does he look like Garfield. He lacks the beard, he has the color and style of the wrong hair and he is not even close in any way (believe me, I am an American history teacher and we are paid to know this kind of thing!). Garfield's real life was a Civil War general and resembled the Smith Brothers cough box boys. Furthermore, using another actor to voice Johnson in dubbing is simply surreal. Never before or since Van Johnson seemed macho enough !! He was a good actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or macho president. <br /> <br /> In addition to the stupid casting, President Garfield's death was not at all like this movie. It is obvious that the filmmakers are actually cashing in on the crazy speculations about the conspiracies concerning the death of JFK, not Garfield. Garfield was killed in Washington DC (not in Dallas) by a lone gunfighter with severe mental problems - not a group of men with guns. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (more than two months later) were incompetent doctors - who probed and probed and tried to recover a bullet (to no avail) and never bothered to clean their hands or tools in the process. In other words, as George Washington (who was practically killed by repeated bleeding when he suffered from pneumonia) died of negligence. Nothing good in the film ... apart from the fact that President Garfield was hit. <br /> <br /> Because the film bears almost no resemblance to the real story, it is like a history lesson taught by someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. Why not also include ninja, combat robots and the Greek gods while you're at it?!?! Apart from some decent acting and production qualities, because the script is a real cow shit, I don't recommend anyone to watch it. It's just a complete and total casino.
