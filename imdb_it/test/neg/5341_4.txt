"Black Friday" made this plot much better, which is why it is remembered and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten hangman. "Shed No Tears" was the working title and it would have been better since he was an absolutely evil character for most of the film. Philip Bennett is just engaged when involved in an incident traffic. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) has been involved in some experimental operations on animals, bringing them back from the dead. His colleagues urge him to try his operation on Phillip, who died. While he is operating, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, is going to the electric chair and the trans migration of the soul occurs. When Philip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul of Panino. He is a changed person, he is rude to his family and he begins to frequent the old places of Panino. He takes control of Lupo's old band - with the name of Philip Bennett, also Wolf's ex-girlfriend - who smells like a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to increase his scores and start eliminating his enemies. The bodies accumulate, including his girlfriend and a policeman, then his own family begins to fall victim. <br /> <br /> But - I HATE those "bad dreams" movies - you always feel disappointed. This film would have been better if he had remained in the character as Panino and had had one last film. Eleanor, his girlfriend, would have become sadder but wiser with his brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the protagonist, has had a great career mostly in the films B. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
