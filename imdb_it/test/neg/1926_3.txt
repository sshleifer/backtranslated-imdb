To be honest, it's been several years since I saw the bile entrusted to celluloid known as "Here on Earth", so forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit rough. I will continue with the main points that afflict the soul of the unfortunate spectator. <br /> <br /> Scene one: Chris Klein, after being thrown out of preparation school (because he looks like a seventeen year old - yes, very credible), gives what I assume is his valedictorian speech ... to a field. Let me repeat it for you - a field. I think we should be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he cannot express. Klein has the delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. He is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but little more. <br /> <br /> Scene two: After some joyriding and pyromaniac teenage pirouettes, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do damage to the venue, which he is forced to rebuild. Obviously. Because who is better to help in building some random idiot who crashed into it / burned it in the first place. Better yet, let's say the casual moron has moved into Josh Hartnett's girlfriend, Miss Sobeski, the girl she imagines for ... her equally wooden online delivery? <br /> <br /> Third scene: The character of Chris Klein is taking shape with the character of Leelee Sobeski and decides to name them the various parts of the body after the states on the east coast. My soul cries. Really, how can this scenario go well? Surely you have to alienate several million people if you understand that their home is equivalent to the most ... erm ... female areas of Miss Sobeski. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey causes some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is actually strangely disproportionate. <br /> <br /> Scene Four: Leelee is running. She falls. This gives her ... a knee cancer. "We always knew he could come back," says his father (?). Right. Knee cancer. To stumble. Maybe I missed something. As I said, some years have passed. I certainly missed something. Not me? For God's sake, please tell me that the girl has not contracted KNEE cancer to keep from falling. <br /> <br /> That scream you just heard is that my soul is dying.
