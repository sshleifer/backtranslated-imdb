George Cukor's The Women remains one of the sparkling gems of 1939, the most golden of Hollywood's golden years. The movie crackled and unleashed and the absence of males was a subtle touch, barely noticed due to all the good entertainment. <br /> <br /> Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York, facing Saks. Large crowds move along the Avenue ... but something is wrong. The shot reveals only well-dressed women (attractive and young). More spooky than I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later in a great fashion show. Which New York fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men? The "no men" rule is rammed to create an alien, unbalanced and distracting world. <br /> <br /> Enter Meg Ryan, who saw for the first time digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous full dress with her retro curls and waving her arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and I could see why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film, she turns into an old Jennifer Aniston look and holds her arms at her sides. This seems intentional as if I said "Look! I can still be relevant!" The character of Ryan is loaded with a coven of friends with miss miss matches (insert here the comparison between Sex and the City) that, if it were real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the powerful bitch, who over the course of the film understands that the dream of her life doesn't make her really happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the lesbian power, all atitudinose and without utility for any of the men who are not there. Debra Messing is a kind of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is a strange choice for the bad girl to say the least. It seems fake, it behaves in a false way and every humor it tries to demonstrate collapses. Someone's comment on her that looked transgender was apt. Other various stars appear to reorganize the furniture on this Titanic. <br /> <br /> The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have called their price, put their tongues firmly on their cheeks and brought out something very intelligent and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks of itself too high for that kind of exploitation. Instead we are given this thing that moves awkwardly without glitter. Entire sections of the dialogue from the original are raised and inserted into a scene with terrible results. At one point, Ryan exclaims something like, "This is not a 1930s movie!" No Meg, it's not.
