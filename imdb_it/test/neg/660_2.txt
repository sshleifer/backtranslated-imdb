Porn legend Gregory Dark directs this horror film that has Glen Jacobs (WWF / WWE Kane / whatever his name is today) in his film debut. He plays Jacob Goodknight, a blind serial killer who is the strong point that takes people away. The plot, both as it is, has a group of problematic young people who clean up the historic hotel where GoodKnight resides and is later offended by him. Hemmingway is not. Start as a fun dopey B-movie, but it soon becomes too boring to be fun. I'm glad I went with rather low expectations, but even those were not met. How can you have a king of porn that directs and still suffers from a lack of nudity ??? for shame. <br /> <br /> My Grade: D- <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Samantha Noble bares her ass for a moment
