This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. What were they thinking. Stop preaching already! This is why we all see Walker Texas Ranger and we won't admit it to our friends. Terrible acting and an extremely fake plot. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin to preach to the public. The director somehow believed that the two had adapted well. It looked like crap! When I saw the title in my local blockbusters it seemed interesting to me. Theirs should have been a warning saying that he was religious instead of the false advertisement of an action / adventure. The first time in a long time I stopped a movie and couldn't tolerate having finished it.
