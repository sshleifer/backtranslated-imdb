I couldn't believe the original evaluation I found when I watched this movie, 9.5? Unfortunately it seems that he is not the only one. <br /> <br /> The film is slow and boring indeed, one of the sad things is that if the film had a realistic rating of about 5 or 6, then the expectation would not have been so high. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this was not the case, so when I watch the film and see the poor story and acting, I get a 3/10 score. /> <br /> Vinnie Jones is superb in Lock stock, and also Snatch, and plays a big tough man, however, he should stick to this role. It's a bit like when Stallone and Schwarzenegger made comedy films, they just don't work. <br /> <br /> Nor can he play the role of principal actor, but he plays better as a supporter or not. When he is in charge, his acting talents are too "in sight" and presented as not very good. Mean Machine is another good example of this.
