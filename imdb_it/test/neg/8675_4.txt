Oh dear! The BBC is not going to be knocked off its pedestal to absorb vintage dramas from this. I agree that this novel by Jane Austens is the difficult one to represent in particular for a modern public, the heroine is certainly not an Elizabeth Bennet, even Edmund is not calculated to make female hearts skip a beat. However, I must say that I was hoping for an improvement for the last one and I was sadly disappointed. The basic story was maintained, but the dialogue was so altered that all that was the tone, the way, the feeling, the intelligence, the depth of Jane Austen was diluted if not lost. If some adaptations of the past can be seen as dated, the weakness of this must be that it is too modern ("his life is a long party" ?????) The cast was generally adequate, but I think Billie Piper was the wrong choice, she needed someone more sober, I didn't have the slightest impression of depth hidden under an extreme submission, she was more like a playful child. I see I have to wait for the BBC to weave its magic again.
