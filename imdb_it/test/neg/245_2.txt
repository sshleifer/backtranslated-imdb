The first 2/3 of this film were not so dissimilar from the American mummy movies of the 30s and 40s. Two lovers of ancient Mexico dared to challenge the law and were sentenced to die. One became an Aztec mummy whose job was to guard the sacred treasure and his beloved lady. And the lady was reincarnated in our days and mother was naturally attracted to her. So far, it's all the typical mummy movie ... even if it's a bit slower and more opaque than the American versions. Oh, and obviously the Aztec mummy looked really, really crap. <br /> <br /> However, in this standard but boring film there is a super-villain. Why? I don't know - it certainly didn't make sense to have one. It seems that this villain wants the treasure and manages to hypnotize the lady and show her where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need the treasure? Well, to buy the equipment needed to create an army of atomic robots, dummy! But first he must build a single mother to defeat his mother, since the mummy has been unstoppable so far. <br /> <br /> You have to see these "human robots" like Flash Gordon's huge awkward robots and other serials, but they have a rubber head of an alleged dead guy inside! They look really hilarious and see the conclusion when there is a huge battle between the lethargic mummy and the equally slow robot that is worth sitting in the rest of the boring movie. Both fight in super slow motion as if they were immersed in taffy ... and it is done in such a foolish and silly way that it is destined to provoke laughter - certainly not chills. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is terribly boring and a confusing mess, especially at the end. However, for fans of bad movies, it is a must see - it's ugly, but unintentionally fun and beautiful to watch and laugh with friends.
