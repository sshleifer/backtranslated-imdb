This is a very strange product from Hollywood. Apparently it didn't work well because the actors who got filming in the credits were completely eliminated from the movie, which means a quick cut was made. It appears to have been torn from Demme's hands, usually competent, and thrown away. On the other hand, it is so totally devoid of substance that perhaps nothing could save it. It has no real center, neither narratively nor in terms of time. Even if we say that the execution time is 92 minutes, I seem to remember that it ends abruptly, around the 80 minute mark. It's over before you even start. It's practically a free laugh. <br /> <br /> The merits of "Matthew Modine's photo" were elusive then how Luke Wilson's image is now.
