I loved this movie when it came out (but I was only 12 then - and I had forgotten that this movie existed until I found a used copy for sale at a gas station one day. I bought it and couldn't wait to see this movie I had loved as a child, and then when I saw this movie again many years later, it struck me .... Because in the world I liked this kid movie, watching it again as an adult I realized that this movie is terrible.The saddest part of this film is that they had everything in place to make the biggest western ever and they blew it !!! the costumes are perfect, good actors, there are 2 soundtracks the orchestra score is wonderful, and keeps the classic spirit of the old Lone Ranger alive, the second score is a series of more artistic country music songs like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and those songs like "The Man in the Mask" are so It's awful that iano funny This movie The strongest point is that it had a brilliant plot and one of the best Westerners ever, and for a while it is fun to see it while John Reid is cured, after he and his fellow Ranger have fallen into an ambush. It's fun to see him grow in his new life and Identity as the Lone Ranger, while he concentrates his identity, and goes in search of revenge to get the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers he drove with . But unfortunately, no matter how good the plot is, it's all ruined by Merle Haggard Narrating everything while you watch what happens (for the love of God why they did it?) Between Narrations of Merle Haggard and The Statler Brothers singing sad (stupid) songs like "Ride little cowboy" played in the backgound make this film impossible to take seriously. I'd like to see a great producer take the same script and the same story and redo the right movie, because at the center of this silly movie is a great western. --- I would describe this film as a beautiful woman's dress in the ugliest clothes. I give him 4 out of 10 stars - if you're 12 and I don't know, then you might love him.
