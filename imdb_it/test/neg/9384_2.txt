Let's talk about creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later gets kidnapped, there's entertainment for you, but only if you like this kind of thing. I didn't think so, to be honest, this episode was terrifying. Fortunately it is one of Duff's episodes in the third season, and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you don't get much of this kind of thing in the third season. So the general verdict? Just read the summary at the top. This is a strong contender (Hell Money says hi!) For the worst episode of season three. To be honest, though, I didn't expect much. I wish I could Oubliette completely this episode. This is something they are right: the title.
