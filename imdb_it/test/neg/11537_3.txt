Princess Warrior is a science fiction action movie with a rather thin plot, essentially about the death of their queen mother, two sisters, a bad one and a good one, fighting for control of the throne. The good sister is beaten and escapes to Earth where she appears naked in a strip club in the middle of a wet T-shirt contest. The rest of the film is basically a long hunting scene, as the evil sister tries to find and kill the younger sister. But the younger sister is helped by Bob, a good-hearted DJ, and everything is complicated by the involvement of the police and the ignorance of the good sister towards the habits and culture of the Earth. The older sister reaches her younger brother several times, but the latter manages to escape and resumes her escape. Throughout this action, there is a sect of women on the home planet that has a sort of seance to bring back the good sister. Unfortunately a good part of this film seems to be a bit boring car chase scenes as they run around Los Angeles (and what was that sound effect when the police car crashed ???) the film culminates in a another physical struggle between the sisters with a predictable end. <br /> <br /> Seems to borrow elements from Star Wars (the light sabers and appearance of the girls' homeworld in the opening and subsequent scenes), Dr. Who (the phone booth as a means of transportation) and some of the costumes (from the cult on the home planet) may have been taken from episodes of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Ms. Dana Fredsti (the evil sister of the film) in another user comment mentioned "the infinite (and boring) competition with the wet shirt: it is seriously the longest competition of wet shirts in the history of cinema and the only one in which competitors were wearing industrially resistant cotton-polyester shirts that defied any effort to make them wet and translucent. "I could not say it better. The only thing I would add is that the music in this scene is simply annoying. <br /> <br /> Most of the acting is rather exaggerated, but it seems to fit the whole style of the film. The actors who played Vinnie and Vito were just too much for me, I just found them annoying. Mrs Fredsti (Curette) seemed to be enjoying herself and didn't take everything too seriously, unlike Sharon Lee Jones who acted decently, but seemed to take everything more seriously. All the cops were described as bumbling idiots, presumably to add comic relief, which is a bit pointless, since the whole movie was pretty comical. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of the evaluations, this film has had a lot of foul language; some topless women and others dressed in a bundled fashion, but not enough skin to satisfy those seeking nudity; a sex scene that has been portrayed in a non-dreamlike artistic dream; and little violence - while there were threats of violence everywhere, the scenes of both sword fighting and brawling were exaggerated, and too much field to be "offensive", even though it seemed that the actors had a lot of fun with it. > <br /> Do I have to ask myself who invented the names of the characters? Ovule (a small egg), Curette (a surgical instrument used to scrape and clean), Exzema (suspiciously similar to a disease characterized by peeling of the skin and itching), Bulemia (an eating disorder with binge and purging) and Rickettsia (a other disease)? <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a sci-fi action movie, poor, low budget, campy, but it entertained me, although I might need a few drinks before watching it again.
