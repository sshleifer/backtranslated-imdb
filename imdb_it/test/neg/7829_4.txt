Olivier Assayas' film plays Asia Argento as a woman who has had an affair with Michael Madsen. Madsen is a businessman who has financial problems. In desperation, he will sell his business to a company called Golden Eagle, a company in the Far East. As Madsen begins his travels with his company, Asia Argento returns to his life. The couple had a torrid love story that included doing business favors for Madsen (with the said Golden Eagle). Once Silver enters the film, the film follows her as we see the intricate web that has intertwined and how complications run dangerously and violently out of control. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan. In fact I was rather bored because the film seems to go from one pillar to another for much of the first hour, during which I kept asking myself what was the point if not to provide an important role to Argento. Argento, daughter of director Dario Argento and director in all respects, is a unique actress. Sometimes extraordinarily well, it's thicker so it won't give you an extravagant portrait of a damaged human being. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I don't think it works completely here mainly because the script is too "complicated" to support it. I didn't care what was going on, so his injured girlfriend just rubbed me the wrong way (it looked more like crazy than anything). I'm not blaming the actors but the writer / director Assayas who once again built a complicated story with the kind of parts that the actors love to deal with, but that leave the audience scratching their heads because they don't really work. <br /> <br /> If you have to try it on cable
