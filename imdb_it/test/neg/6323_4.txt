George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are many jokes about the dementia of his Alzheimer's and most of them are not funny, although there have been some funny moments sprinkled here and there (like the nude running through the park scene and the elderly at home). At first, Segal tries to kill his mother because he is hard to live and because he is a selfish type. Making the film a bit like a Wiley Coyote against the Roadrunner comedy, where it tries again and again to kill this indestructible girl, would have been a hoot - too bad this was NOT the general tone of the film. <br /> <br /> I applaud Carl Reiner's attempt to make an insipid film that aims to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HIS MOTHER DEAD, EATING RAOUL and KATAKURIS HAPPINESS - all films about death that dare to offend. The problem here, though, is that WHERE IS AFT? it has some fun moments, but it also has a lot of those dishes and the overall product is incredibly bland. Furthermore, subjects like homosexual rape, incest and the like are really hard to make fun. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" which is considered a cult film, although I can't see anyone wanting to see it more than once.
