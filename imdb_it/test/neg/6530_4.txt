Played by Tomas Milian and Manny Perez ?? 'Washington Heights' is a low-budget drama set in a Latin Quarter of New York. <br /> <br /> A young comic artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape from his Latin quarter. When his father is paralyzed by the shot of a thief, the young man is forced to manage the family bodega. <br /> <br /> The film was shot on a budget (low-resolution video and poor audio) with low-key actors. <br /> <br /> The plot ran well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were simply terrible. We don't know for sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in prison for filming. <br /> <br /> 4/10
