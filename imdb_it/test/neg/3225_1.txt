what happened to Mathew Modine's career ??? I can still remember when he was considered an actor on a list ... <br /> <br /> was the ruthless island the last nail in the coffin of a once promising career ??? wow, this guy must really hate the guts of Renny Harlin ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be a bad comedy, but it can't make people laugh, the characters are caricatures, and badly drawn in that .. but what bothers me most is seeing Mr. Modine engage in this type of role, alongside actors so far removed from his caliber, when he was making films like BIRDIE that he could never do in his worst nightmares imagined that in the future he would have acted in a film with a flogger who had just closed the anus, and maybe it's even worse, next to Elizabeth Berkley !!!
