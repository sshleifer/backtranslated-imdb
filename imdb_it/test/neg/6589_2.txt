First of all, I'm sorry for my English. Second, the true story of this episode: 39 soldiers, "Magistral" operation. 6 soldiers were killed. Even hundreds of rebels have been killed. Within 10 years the Soviet army lost less than 15,000 people and killed over 900,000 insurgents and civilians. There are no rebels without the permanent help of the United States. The veteran of the war: "Traditions, there are no traditions in this film, there is no military oath, there is no first jump, there is no farewell to the Banner Fighter and the medals There is nothing sacred, there is only hatred for the Soviet army: being in this area in a state of investigation, we revealed jet shells of departure from the insurgents. An exact place could not define.But the artillerymen asked to give an easier square I also covered the problem with the couple's minutes, here was the reality of the fights, so there was no feeling of "oblivion". These feelings appeared then, already in other wars and in other states (Chechnya), others were children, kindly, more humanly, the "prapor" were like fathers, fighting for good and climax, full orgy, shooting everywhere, young Ben-Laden mental attacks, not killed both unbroken and full absence of help or mutual. main thing in this war, even the Americans have accused us of inadequate application of force against the rebels. And here it is directed in reverse. In the summer of 1981 I spoke of myself with firmness, which personally should fill at least 50 insurgents. Consequently, the accepted "plan" was underestimated and, following a demobilization, I left strongly bruised and mischievous as in fig. After returning the first few months I had the feeling of not being at war until the end, it is not business that has completed all of the following. There was some vague, but an overwhelming feeling of discontent with herself and caustic irritation. These nighttime ideas can be and misplaced. Officials really in the film are absolutely not present. On this occasion, what is the time they spent with the staff. The combat is constant. New Year to fight. Where did they get the beds from? In the mountains? And so on ... "<br /> <br /> If you want a fairy tale about war," 9 rota "and" Shtrafbat "are for you. If you want the truth, you have to see" Come and see "or" The bats they ask for fire ".
