When I saw on the voting panel that some people had given this film a score of 10, I thought they didn't know that the score wasn't on 100. This is a catastrophic film in the true meaning of that term. Poorly written and weakly directed with the so-called actors unable to act, but able to make a face when ordering. For the first 60 minutes the story seems to go in one direction, then it changes tack and becomes involved in a power struggle, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to devise a clever way for the hero with limited powers to beat the villain with superpowers, scammers "writer". It is obvious that the father was added to the so-called plot, because it was easier than processing an acceptable result. Not that writing can even know the word "epilogue". Some movies go directly to DVD. This should have gone directly to the dustbin.
