When they announced this film for TNT I was excited. A parody of "Enough" by Donald Westlake was one of my favorite stories of all time. After watching it, I wasn't so happy. Recently I had the chance to see him a second time with my aunt, and once again I was disappointed (she didn't like it too much and she had never read the book). In this film they managed to subtract all the charm of the book and turn it into an opaque mush. Much of the problem was William H. Macy. I like him in other films, but he played (Terry / Carey) Thorpe as a stuttering and incompetent yutz. In the book Thorpe takes much of the valium for his nerves, but remains externally collected in almost every time that is part of the fun. SPOILERS follow: They also left out a big part of the story (apart from a second look at the embassy), where Thorpe doesn't solve 1 but 4 murders for the police. This is important not just because it's fun, but because it helps set up the relationship between Fred and Thorpe. In the film, Fred's betrayal, in the end, has nothing to do, because they don't seem so close. In the book they become good friends especially on Fred's side, which makes it even more ironic that he is the one who organizes Thorpe's downfall. Fred also suffered a bit for casting, I adore Adam Arkin but he was not cheerful, happy to be alive, a sort of Detective, character traits that Fred's book possesses, which makes it more obvious for him to confuse the tests and therefore more shocking. Patricia and Edgarson were quite close to the book, and James Cromwell was exceptional despite not much resembling Martin Balsam. The whole boring boat house scene that was entirely added to the film was far less interesting than the police who found Edgarson's body after Thorpe sent him to Seattle and accused the death of the crowd. Kit was ok, even though it had been rewritten for the most part, and it would have been nice to see her die while getting slightly annoying. I don't mind changing books to make films, I know they are necessary because of the length and the difficulty, but it would have been nice if some of the changes in this film had been more fun or smarter than boring.
