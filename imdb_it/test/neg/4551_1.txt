Proud of being a Dutchman, I'm really shocked by gestures like these. Why? why this economic recitation? Why this plot that sucks? why a dozen sequels? why or why? add a lot of Dutch hot chicks in an attempt to save this movie from redemption, and guess what? all minor breezergirlies in the Netherlands go to see it. I was forced to see him at a party. all the girls were going crazy when Daan Schuurmans entered the screen, all the boys drank another beer and grumbled ... But the thing that really annoys me is the fact that this type of film is the only kind of film that filmmakers Dutch can produce ... (apart from "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority in other countries .. It adds nothing to our imagination ... It is only F ** ks up the brain of little girls 13 years old ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you will burn forever!
