The respected Western writer Budd Boetticher is sadly out of place with this unconventional story of modern cops and thieves suffering from a strong lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have given up the tests and settled for the first round, as Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming put little effort into their roles, offering flat lines and no energy. <br /> <br /> Kind Employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works like a man inside a bank job that goes wrong and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets off to kill the wife of the detective who killed her. Hundreds of policemen are mobilized to prevent him from reaching the house of intention that has been transferred to another location, but you wouldn't know it in the final moments of the films in which Foggy is losing his feet behind the victim (who has somehow thought taking a bus back home was a wise move as a company of policemen watches and bickers over what action to take. Sounds absurd? You should see it. It's all this and more. <br /> <br /> Working with Lucien Ballard's camera does a decent job of bringing the noir to the suburbs, but the editing is fake and shapeless and drains the film of its suspense and rhythm. Like Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film, managing to arouse great sympathy as he moves from the sweet soul to the murderer. These attributes, apart from Killer, fail evenly in construction and execution, making his message clear. Go old western Budd.
