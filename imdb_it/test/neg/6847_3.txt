I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the only good things about this film. She's my absolute favorite actress, every role she plays is always so good. His character is crafty, sarcastic, intelligent, light, funny and astute. He pulls this role really well and you get a good feeling about his character. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is pretty ugly. Music is the funniest thing left. One of the characters has this strange circular radio that he carries with him while wearing his striped zebra tank top. <br /> <br /> One thing that was a little intriguing in history was the idea that someone would hire him three university-age children to embellish an old abandoned theater. Give them the keys and say: go there. It would be really fun and I would like someone to give me this chance! Imagine going to an old abandoned theater with two other people and decide how to decorate and fix it. You have total control over the entire building. It would be great fun! Unfortunately, the characters don't consider it an exciting adventure, they consider it a big problem. They go around with long faces and fight each other all the time. It's kind of a fiasco. But it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even enthusiastic about. <br /> <br /> The film does a good job of making you feel powerless or a little scared by the theater itself. However, the acting (besides Woronov .. and maybe Murdoch, the boss - just because he makes a fake and hungry businessman who never had any luck) is really horrible and you end up feeling dissatisfied. Moreover, the casual slapstick is a bit tacky and somewhat ruins the reality that the film tries to create. <br /> <br /> See this if you bypass Mary Woronov, the electronic keyboard-style Casio funky rhythms of the 80s and if you think you have a gigantic theater abandoned to yourself it's not at all intriguing.
