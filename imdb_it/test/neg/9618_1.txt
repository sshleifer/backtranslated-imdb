The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was badly done. The burn engineer had to be drunk, asleep or not even in the room while it was in progress. It seems to have been mastered by about a tenth generation copy and about halfway through the movie, the audio sync disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the audio. If you are thinking of buying this DVD, please save. I remember seeing this movie at the theater in 1973. Also, the VHS copy of this film with the title "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than the DVD, but the remaining minutes of the film are "missing". Where is the original negative camera?
