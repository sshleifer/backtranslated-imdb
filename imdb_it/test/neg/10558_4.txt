What a cast ... and what a waste. Seriously, when a movie has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone you would expect some quality. However, the film is a big mess with an unlikely story that seems not to stop giving twists. Yes, I think they thought they were really smart with all this. <br /> <br /> The story is not only messy and unlikely, but it is not exactly terribly original. Use elements from previous and best films based on the poker game. But for me it was really the many useless turns of the scene in the film that made it. It made the story so unlikely to look. Moreover, the script remains full of a lot of holes in poker game mistakes and things that don't make much sense. Because a person above all things wants to play against a card player who is known as the best cheat in the game. This is what the film is about, but it never made much sense to me. <br /> <br /> Although the film has an exceptional cast, it still seems that most of the actors were skeptical of their roles. I don't know what Stuart Townsend is about. He is a good actor but in most of the roles he plays he always feels out of place. Maybe it's his looks, I don't know. Basically this was also the reason why it was replaced in "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". Even Thandie Newton is not very good and actually quite annoying in her "strong" female role. And what was the point of having Melanie Griffith in this? Oh, I guess I could go on talking about the movie, its casting and I could complain even more about the way Jamie Foxx's character has too limited a viewing time, but I guess you understand my point of view. <br /> <br /> Damian Nieman is not an original writer / director and he does not manage his own material very well either. The scenes often feel disjointed, try to put too many characters and everything about the film is superficial and in a certain sense predictable. Moreover, sometimes the film has some wrong changes, which does not help to make this film a unique whole. The film was also one of the main box office bombs and it's no wonder that Damian Nieman has never made a film since. <br /> <br /> A commotion too big for you to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
