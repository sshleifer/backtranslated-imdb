What is the story of what is on the screen. At first I have to say, don't touch this movie, it's for your best (sucks). And really what the story is, at the beginning it seems ok but after ten minutes everything gets worse. And that's not all, you can't see what's on the screen, it's too dark all the time. <br /> <br /> Don't touch.
