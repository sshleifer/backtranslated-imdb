I really wanted to appreciate this movie because I have admiration for the Italian cheat movie (in particular Jaws rip-offs!), But the simple fact is that Monster Shark is not very good. There are all signs of this being a big piece of junk; we have one of the kings of scruffy cult cinema, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiw, who has taken the lead role, and a central creature stupid enough to give even the best that this a kind of films must offer a run for his money, yet somehow the film still manages to be rather stale. The fact that the "monster shark" does not work too often is probably a good thing given the creature's design, but there is never enough elsewhere to let the film pass without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of Florida (or rather somewhere in Italy) where several local people showed up in the water with their arms and legs missing. It will not be long before the local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it is up to a heterogeneous group of various sea experts to take it alive! <br /> <br /> The main problem with this film is that it always seems very useless, and since there is little in terms of characters or plot development, even the least demanding of viewers is likely to get bored for a long time . This type of film is not famous for being brilliant, although the fun element of films like "The Last Shark" and "Killer Fish" is unfortunately absent most of the time. The thing I love about the main character Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to be taking himself seriously regardless of the movie he is in (even if he has only made four). This is certainly the case, although Bava never allows him to dive completely, and he often feels like a spare tire like the rest of the film. Much of the execution time is spent looking at the various characters in the American lager, and it's not very charming; even though Bava manages to get good by the end with a frantic action action while the central monster finally manages to devastate his potential captors. Overall, there's really not much to recommend this film. As mentioned, I really like this kind of thing and I even got bored on numerous occasions. Only for hardcore Italian horror fans!
