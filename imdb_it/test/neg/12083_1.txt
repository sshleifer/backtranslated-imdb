This film had potential. If it had been handled differently. What he needed was a different director. This is certain. And maybe a different protagonist. I just can't understand the character of Minnie Driver - or at least how he played it. It was absolutely incredible. I can't believe she would also like her performance in this movie. Probably she was abandoned by the director or unable to provide what the director was trying to get her to do. I'm writing this while I'm still watching it. I think I hated being in his shoes trying to "act" something I didn't understand. Well, we just proceeded to the relationship that begins with the son (I'm still looking). I am now starting to be deeply embarrassed for everyone involved in this endeavor. If you like watching movies that miss their brand in style, then watch this.
