Please don't go see this. I had a lot of laughs during this movie, but they were all due to the involuntary comedy. <br /> <br /> There were only three characters in this movie, so it was surprising how bad the character development was. Pacino played Pacino again and got worse most of the time. The scenes in this film seem to have been put together by 20 other bad movies from a really bad editor. There is no continuity and I found myself wondering why I didn't leave 15 minutes for this. <br /> <br /> I would suggest never seeing a film directed by D.J. Caruso. This was really terrible.
