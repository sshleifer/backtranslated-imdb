Exhibition for children of the 60s with ex-Vaudevilliani playing men at hand. As you can expect, I'm a mess in everything they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for commercials in the 15-minute time slot), they do things like setting up a fence between neighbors in war, helping a wizard on stage and managing a trunk and a wallet found. /> <br /> Growing up I had never met this show (which seems to have been shot in New York). I thought I had heard or seen most of the children's shows of the period either through having seen them as a child or observed in conventions of nostalgia. Until Alpha Video published it on DVD, I was completely unaware of its existence. <br /> <br /> The show sounds like the Three Marmittoni mixed with Abbott and Costello, as do the people who mimic routines. (In fact one of the two claims to have created the legendary routine "Slowly I transformed ..." that Abbott and Costello have perfected). It's not bad, but it's not good at all because everything looks watered down. The times are often off (although perhaps due to bad direction) and the jokes have been recycled years before the show started for the first time. Chances are you've seen it all before. The positive side is the kind of thing that would be perfect for introducing younger children to the magic of vaudeville-style comedy, but is trying to get parents to be sedated even with short episodes. <br /> <br /> Only for nostalgia addicts. Everyone else should try to see an original by Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges.
