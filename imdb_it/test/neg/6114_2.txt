I love how everyone treats this show like it's the next big American sitcom. I saw five episodes of this abomination and the only person who approached a real teacher was the old man who loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just nice people trying to read the jokes written by people who had never entered a real class. I loved the way each episode consisted of the two idiots (one who was fired and the other who didn't) who got into some form of annoyance that indirectly involved their students. The English girl who thought she had found a nice quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he had become an idiot. The hot chick who was there for the particular purpose of being warm, and the principal and his servant who served to somehow displace the almost non-existent plot. I loved the fact that almost all the teachers in this show were very young, but I ask you to rethink your high school days and remember the teachers you had. . . did they look like this? Or did you go to high school where there were middle-aged people teaching? That is the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any form of research on what happens in schools. In public schools, the principals do not have the power to instruct and dismiss teachers, the school council does, but in every episode I saw the principal threatened to fire his teachers. Think back to your history course. . . . . or think of some history lessons, have you ever seen an incredibly hot English chick teach a lesson in American history? No. Have you ever seen such a large teaching room that you can play basketball? No. <br /> <br /> Teachers could have been a great show if it was actually based on some form of reality. What makes teaching fun are the stories you get from interacting with students, and teachers find it fun because they approach students day after day. The excessive emphasis on their life outside of teaching has only done another four-camera camera that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment that said unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I didn't buy it. The show could have modeled itself after other successful sitcoms and used a single camera format, and it should have focused more on the teacher's relationships with their students and not between them. <br /> <br /> He gets a star to try and a star for the hot chick (he was really sexy). <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as an attempt by hacks to understand a profession. I just hope that if they do another sitcom based on teaching, learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity like this never touches the TV screen.
