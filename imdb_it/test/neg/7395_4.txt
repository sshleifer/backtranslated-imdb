Imagine an island of Gillisano set in the African desert in modern times. Add people like nowhere as Skipper or Marianne - and enough anguish to fill a German psychiatric office. It casts a plot that manages to be interesting only episodic and literary parallelism that never delves deep enough to really satisfy. You shared a really dark topic that has been exploited since the first travelers in the world found themselves very, very lost. <br /> <br /> If THE KING IS ALIVE were not a product of the ruling tsars of Dogme 95, would this film be gaining as much attention? Dogme 95 is Hollywood as the modern Danish is of rococo. A by-product of digital technology, this Scandinavian movement tries - rather dogmatically - to remove the artificiality in film production, using more natural elements and returning to the essence of the narrative. PEARL HARBOR, for example, is the Antichrist Dogme. <br /> <br /> The director / co-author The saga of Kristian Levring reflects interpersonal relationships and human nature when put under the fire of a life-threatening situation. Eleven people aboard a bus on the sand dunes of Namibia find themselves suddenly stranded in the remains of an abandoned city. An African local who does not speak his or her own language serves as an observer and narrator (whose insights are among the cutest in the film). While the strongest walk away for a five-day walk to the nearest village, the others lag behind, surviving on dented carrots and wandering around for their probable future as vulture food. Former actor Henry decides that this rather unattractive group needs a diversion and writes KING LEAR by hand. He assigns the roles, and the group spends many days learning lines and trying, in an attempt to divert attention from the seemingly inevitable. <br /> <br /> Gradually the cast begins to lose it and the ferocity of their nature? ? or, as William Golding might say, human nature begins to emerge. If you've ever seen LORD OF THE FLIES, you know that these things can become ugly, that being in a rescue situation can also turn Mother Teresa into the terrifying PMSing of Calcutta. <br /> <br /> The film was shot using an international ensemble of American, British, French and South African actors who, according to the Dogma dogma, develop themselves and their roles in an organic way. THE KING was also filmed chronologically, adding a sense of realism to the growing desperation of his characters. After up to three camcorders were digitally filmed, the results were transferred to 35mm film. <br /> <br /> The most powerful performance comes from Jennifer Jason Leigh, who plays a Boho Pop Tart who tries to strengthen the spirits of the group in every way possible. Henry (David Bradley) is another refined character, whose passion for his life's work saves the band from total despair. It is difficult to feel too sorry for the other cruel wives and their idiotic husbands, irascible elderly women, sullen French intellectuals, wealthy men who have more important places to be abandoned in the Namibian desert. Beckett might hate this question, but why would this group riding a remote bus across Africa in the first place? Deadly morbidity! Absolute desperation rendered in graphic detail! An inexorably boring rhythm! To enjoy.
