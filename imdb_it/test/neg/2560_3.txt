This is really the film that made kung fu popular in the 1970s. However, if he ever had any kind of excitement or even an interesting storyline, it doesn't seem to have aged very well. <br /> <br /> Short story: extremely tight, slow and confusing plot with run-of-the-mill choreography, whiplash sounds typically annoying and exaggerated with every punch and kick, and constant "twists" that never end. By the time the film reaches its emotional climax, I had long since lost all the wind to really worry about it. <br /> <br /> See it for its historical value as a milestone in Chinese kung fu cinema - just leave your expectations on the doorstep, or you'll be bitterly disappointed. <br /> <br /> Only for the most avid fans.
