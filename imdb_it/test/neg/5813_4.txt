I love Hedy Lamarr. I think she was very underrated as an actress in the 1940s. It was the Nastassja Kinski of that era, and critics didn't take it seriously. Having said all this ... this film is a BORE. When I saw it for the first time, I was shocked by the lack of continuity, not only in the plot, but in makeup and costumes. Hedy's make-up changes from shot to shot. The same goes for the length and style of the hair. Reason: this thing has had so many writers and has undergone so many stops and it starts it's incredible that they have ever published it. His "Lady of the Tropics" started filming AFTER this started, but was released before "I Take This Woman". In fact, at the time, he was known in Hollywood as "I Re-Take This Woman". This should tell you something. I'm also a Spencer Tracy fan, but it's terrible here. I have read in various stories about films that absolutely disliked Hedy Lamarr, and this seems perfectly obvious in the film. NO chemisteria whatsoever. The plot wanders around one after the other and eventually comes up very strangely. I absolutely cannot recommend this.
