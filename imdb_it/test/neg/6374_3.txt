I'm obviously disappointed so I'll be brief and I won't waste time. First of all, the plot was not inspired ... at least. The animation was even worse, we are in 2008 for God's sake and it seemed like a brighter version of G.I.Joe. I won't even bother to characterize the performance of the actors and the dialogues. Or maybe I'll do it because I've just seen that to post a comment here you need 10 lines (?! ??!?!). Where were we? Oh yes, the performance, well, it was totally flat, without passion and talent if I apologized. Now as for the dialogues, just like the acting, no memorable quote, nothing that someone would not expect. We just hope the film is decent ... at least.
