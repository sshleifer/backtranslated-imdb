Because it came from HBO and according to the IMDb chart, I saw the first season of this series, what a waste. The characters are occasionally interesting but mostly like cartoons. The acting ranges from good to mediocre talent with an emphasis on the latter. Not only the prisoners, even the viewers should leave any hope at the door of the cell that this story is credible, it is such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong testicular strength to keep watching. Violence, as with most developments in history, is titillating and whatever is theoretically served, is a lite variety. If your excellent television idea includes the quality of writing, acting and overall production of THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET UNDER, avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate Jerks, look at OZ. Things like these give a bad name.
