Regardless of the manufacturer, he lost completely. The Lone Ranger is not a field, but the "icon" for the good all over the world. And it's a total violation of the spirit of the character that the only real Lone Ranger, Mr. Clayton Moore, was forbidden to wear his mask in public appearances when this film was released. <br /> <br /> Whelp, long story In short, the only saving grace of this gross (and poorly made) distortion was that year, I had the honor of meeting Mr. Clayton Moore in Columbus, Ohio , as part of a tour resulting from the bad press on Mr. Moore's treatment. Needless to say, the character, integrity, and presence of Mr. Moore far exceeded the film. <br /> <br /> Some things cannot be done better. There is only one Lone Ranger.
