The atmosphere in this show is great. There is a lot of excellent accumulation, but this is where this show fails. There is much to be gained for nothing. You'll constantly see a creepy set up that makes it look like something really scary is coming out of the corner and then ... nothing. Over and over again nothing. You hear many stories of people talking about bizarre events but you don't see any. They come to the doors of these people, talk about their deep and emotional past, put up lame equipment and find nothing! there is nothing in this show that leads me to believe in something paranormal. I laugh every time they need to exercise a "horrible spirit" that we, as a public, have not seen. They get rid of the spirit that never was and everything is put in a small clean package. A show that seemed so extravagant and with such great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
