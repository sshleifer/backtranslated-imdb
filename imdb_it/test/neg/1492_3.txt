I'm really disappointed with this job. It is silent, it continues to repeat itself, for the most part it is not exact and sometimes it is about to fail. I think it is made for elementary school, especially because it continues to repeat itself continually, leaving large empty spaces. A child could really have fun and learn from it, but a better way to make a child appreciate theoretical physics is books like "A Brief History of Time" or "The Tao of Physics". If you are familiar with the topic at a very simple level, you will not get any new information or view from this series. Don't waste time with it. Nice eye candy though.
