I didn't particularly like Sliding Doors or Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I certainly didn't have this excuse of little value for those films. An idea that was done to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is poor and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity simply to get an R rating and some scenes that don't they were really necessary but we were there to push the limits (I don't really need to see a child urinating or struggling with a diaphragm, especially when they have absolutely no connection or use in the film). <br /> <br /> The acting was also very poor, the only actor I found less satisfying was his daughter; the rest was two-dimensional and quite incredible. The people I saw it with left the room halfway; I managed to finish it, but not without the quick forwarding of part of it. <br /> <br /> Overall: Nothing new here, it's a generic and boring film. The few rather amusing moments are far outweighed by the silly or stupid ones. This would be boring even if it hadn't been done before. If it were not such a replacement I would classify it as a five, but even for an Indie film this was seriously lacking, and as a remake it also loses originality: 3/10.
