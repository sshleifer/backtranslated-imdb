If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece, this is not it. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies so horrible that they are actually good, then this could be for you. There are so many involuntary laughs in this film, which could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the opening titles, which say "Jack-O", and then add the word "Lanterna", as if the viewer was not able to understand that the film was about a pumpkin of the giant pumpkin shown on both covers and in the opening scene of the film. After that, the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of which makes much sense. Jack-o is everywhere, in people's homes, in the woods, yet he never seems to do much of anything. He does some killing, but the long accumulation of those killings is so misinterpreted and constructed that you almost want Jack-o to bring out his anger on you the viewer. In addition to this, the plot consists of poor acting, free nudity and a ridiculous plot line. The acting in this film is among the worst I've ever seen in my over 35 years of cinema. The boy who is the protagonist of the film (the director's son) has the same emotions as a corpse, and almost all the other actors / actresses are just as bad for many reasons (especially the lady with the eyed eyes with the eyes bigger than saucers ). But having said all this, if you take this for what it is, (it's a steaming pile of dung), then you'll get some laughter from this movie. What I also found funny is that the producers of the DVD consider it appropriate to publish a "Version of the tenth anniversary" of this film (as if the original was not good enough). And someone actually had the idea to create a "backstage" mini movie that is also included in the tenth edition of the anniversary (I don't know why) ....... I will give this 3 smashed pumpkins of 10 .. .
