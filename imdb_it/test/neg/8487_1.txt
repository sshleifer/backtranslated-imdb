Well, I had the chance to see this movie the other day. I didn't know what to expect because I never saw the trailer and so ... but what I discovered by just looking at the first 10 minutes is that this movie is the worst I've ever had the misfortune to see. > <br /> I wish I could give this film a rating of 0. The first 10 minutes were bad, but as soon as it went on stage for the party, I just wanted to get into a coma, it was really badly done. The actors had no direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that say that if you have a child to entertain for 90 minutes, etc ... but really why should we expose children to this type of film? He has a poor humor, a crude and raw comedy at best and focuses on poor special effects to fill 80% of his time. I'm sure some people in Hollywood will go out on the streets after these movie bombs. <br /> <br /> Also, how can 39 people give this movie to 10. I mean, getting anyone who gives this 10-bit movie has any mental problems and / or works for the movie company. This film should average 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 due to the people who ranked it 10. Really sad.
