I heard a lot about the inventive camera and the direction of this film. I thought that both were also a disaster <br /> <br /> even a really terrible acting. the main 'heroin' in the film is irritating beyond imagination and has absolutely nothing useful to give in any situation. everything he does or says is stupid, and generally seems to only confuse people's lives. if you could fight, I could forgive you <br /> <br /> overall all the women in this film are stereotyped "broads" who need a man to save them. and all the men in this film are a weak muscle cheat capable of saving anyone <br /> <br /> this is a poor film, and I urge you to avoid it. looking at something like "the sword of destiny", instead, I feel it's much better than this messy mess of a movie.
