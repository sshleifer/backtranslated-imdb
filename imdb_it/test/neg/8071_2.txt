I live in Rome where the Turkish director of this film lives and works. From my Italian friends I heard many positive things about his films ... so after seeing the preview I really wanted to see "Sacred Heart". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly improbable and naive films. I love movies, but this is really heavy and bad. The main character is really crazy, and should be locked up in an asylum ... made me sympathize with the negative character of an aunt, who runs a drug dealing company that just wants to make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist ... Ouch !!!
