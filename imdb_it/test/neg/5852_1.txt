I don't know if I am wrong or all the others who say that this film is good, honestly I just want to do a favor to people who have doubts about seeing it, rent it or even worse, buy it (don't do it really!). Trailers and previews very early may seem funny in one way or another, but it's not funny at all, it can fall into a series of laughter-here scenes that tend to get into really bad jokes, very bad bad actions , scenes without taste, cheese effects; this movie has it all, it's all wrong. <br /> <br /> As a final comment the film would have been fun due to the basic concept, but believe me it is really very far from that.
