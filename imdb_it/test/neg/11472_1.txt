I saw the director cut last night ... glad it was free, even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to see this "film noir" attempt. Anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me, they weren't smart, they seemed more like budget constraints than anything else. The "non-traditional" casting I also found distracting. If you had to stop following the story to ask me "what the hell is the black girl doing here?" then the narrator disappointed me. Again, it's not smart to me, but annoying and irritating, and the school's final project is very filmic. And for heaven's sake, if you're going to shoot in black and white, at least use some of the techniques used in old movies that take full advantage of not having colors. There was no use of shades in the lighting, no shade of gray, no depth, no texture ... only black and only white ... boring!
