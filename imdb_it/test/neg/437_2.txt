AWiP tries to be fun, scary, tense and romantic ... and fails in every respect. The acting is average at best, but mostly stupid. The special effects are not enough to compensate for the stupid plot devices, and the harmony between the * ANY * character is youthful. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be angry with yourself, don't pay money to see it.
