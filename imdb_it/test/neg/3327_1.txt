My daughter liked it, but I was amazed that a character in this movie smoked. As if it wasn't horrible enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis smoking in their films - at least children's films should be more considerate! I wonder: was it intentional? Does the big tobacco "sponsor" the film? What does it take to ban smoking from movies? At least films intended for children and adolescents.
