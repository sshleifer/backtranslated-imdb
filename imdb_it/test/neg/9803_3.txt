I kept waiting for the film to move me, to inspire me, to shock me, to make me sad somehow but it didn't stir any of my emotions. It's just meandered to the end. None of the characters seemed really unique or complex, they simply looked like actors playing their lines. I think it could have been a better film if the characters expressed more emotion. The only one who did and was credible was the veteran and probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as possible. It was a waste of talent, movies, their time and mine. If there is a message or a meaning or a genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden or I am very dense, which I doubt.
