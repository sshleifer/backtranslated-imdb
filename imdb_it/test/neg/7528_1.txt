PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing texture and its horrible acting. <br /> <br /> First, let's face the characters. Cherry (Brooke Balderson) continues to support an outrageous rage throughout the film, due to her overwhelming passion to become the queen of the dance. However, she becomes completely unknown to the public because Cherry wants to become the queen of the dance in the first place. Even before the appointments are read, she goes wild around the school with a constant disinterest to be there, and shows no interest in the place or her students. Why does she care so much about being their dancing queen? Brooke Balderson apparently presents an "acclaimed" performance but actually spends all her time with an angry face, trampling, killing people. Maybe it's just me, but I think if you gave a young actor / actress a script that only requires him / her to behave in a madly angry way, you're not asking for much. Also, don't allow the character to develop very well. <br /> <br /> The character of Beth, played by Jennifer Dreiling, is even worse. Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection with his character. When she is harassed by her principal, she puts him down (after a few seconds) without feeling feelings of disgust or shock or something equally traumatizing. His jokes are read as if he were reading trivia on the back of a cereal box. <br /> <br /> Throughout the rest of the film, the students in charge of his abduction sound more like they were planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal, sitting tied up in their basement. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Cherry is killing several candidates for the dance queen and no one even notices. (Yes, I understand, I understand, the whole city is worried about the prom. Very realistic. At least you could enter funny scenes with the cops, but you could ask too much.) For example, immediately after Cherry leads the school and knocks down a handful of students, Beth is found interviewed by local media. The journalist mentions "the shooter" in a way that no one seems to know who killed these innocent students, but then a second later he asks "What do you think of the weapons in the hands of minors?" or something like that. Where did the journalist jump to such conclusions? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, after Cherry killed the promising prom queen and the prom is over, the media are showing themselves again, Beth simply adds that "she understands (Cherry's) must be heard "and walks away with his friends, smoking cigarettes in a calm and unaffected mood. No one is even challenged by having just witnessed a murder. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the students who constantly park in a yellow area, and no one seems to worry that there is a sudden increase in violence in the city, Julie who lives in a big house with no parents present and the bizarre party at his house (maybe I'm a bit off stage, but the last time I heard, high school parties didn't foresee the artistic dance of naked women in a pool of water while men do marshmallows and everyone gets bask in their attitudes "I'm so indie and mod"), the horrible acting of Beth's parents with her mother acting exaggeratedly and her father simply nodding with everything the mother has to say (and not in a funny way either), along with stupid scenes like the new black principal who runs after Cherry while trying to shoot her with a gun. Yes. Very realistic. <br /> <br /> The only compliment I can give to this film is that photography is wonderful. The corners are flattering and the screen is very clear and sharp with each shot. <br /> <br /> Too bad the acting and the script are not.
