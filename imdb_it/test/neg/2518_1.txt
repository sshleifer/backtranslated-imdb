I, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing it from Patton Oswalt. Strangely, it was easier to find than I thought. However, it should not be surprising that I found it used. <br /> <br /> The plot is masterfully added to the title. It's a bed that eats. Nothing more, nothing less. There is an effort to throw a plot but not very good. <br /> <br /> The blood of a demon has ended up on a bed and, as a result, becomes possessed. It devours everything that happens on it by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but he was sick and ends up behind a painting in the room where he lives. The narration is told entirely through him. <br /> <br /> This film fails horribly for everything, even to be bad. However, it is not without its charm mark.
