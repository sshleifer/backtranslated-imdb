This film is about 7 couples on the Hampstead moor on a sunny Wednesday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Show 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, dissolving a relationship, homosexuals, elderly, blind date and escort service. The geographical position is not connected to each other, so it is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, without a visible plot. The film jumps from one pair to another without any logic. I find this film boring and aimless. The only thing that redeems is the good weather for the whole film. It's sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo get lost in this movie.
