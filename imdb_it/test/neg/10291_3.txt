This film was * good * relatively during the early parts of it. <br /> <br /> We have a story, from 3 points of view. So let's look for some clues and complete the story. <br /> <br /> Oh wait ... none of those things are important because the FBI guys are the bad guys! Although it was a great twist ... it was a terrible turn. I immediately downgraded the film from 7 to 8 or 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else see why the turnaround is so bad? Yes, it's a nice shock. But it's bad because it has absolutely nothing to do with the previous hour and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the killers. <br /> <br /> The killers are in about 5 minutes of this movie (like murderers) and the two FBI agents are only in 15 minutes from the previous hour and twenty. /> <br /> We get ... surveillance ... Oh, the Killers are voyeurs. THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE, because they have been described only in limited terms as simple psychopaths. And the hour and twenty minutes of surveillance we are watching of the 3 stories comes out of the window while everyone died in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the ending even more ridiculous. Oh, they killed a bunch of FBI agents at the beginning ... which FBI agents sleep together? All in the same room. Being found and killed by amateurs and then imitated by people who know nothing about being FBI agents? A policeman 3 meters away, apparently, cannot hit either of them with a normal police gun capable of firing several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel real when they make absurd jumps that they believe they will believe. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that the film ends about 10-15 minutes after they were revealed as murderers with a girl standing in the field somewhere ...
