I saw this in yesterday's preview and I must say it was terrible. After the closing credits I thought: "Hey with this cast will probably be pretty good". It wasn't like that at all. <br /> <br /> Predictable groans, terribly drawn characters (perhaps except those of little Lara) and a final one could include 10 minutes in the film. And worst of all, it has misused a delicate subject (people with handicaps) for low-level and mostly insignificant jokes without ever touching anything except the problem surface. The handicapped person who the film sympathizes the most is the one who is only pretending it. What kind of message is that? And the film doesn't have a thought that ends at all, basically it comes down to: "I love you, it doesn't matter that you behaved like a sting". <br /> <br /> To summarize: Great cast that had to be terribly bored to sign up for a terrible movie.
