I am ashamed of myself that I actually went to the theater to see this film when it was first released. While I suppose that his subtly veiled representation of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is done quite well, it is a film that should never have been made in the first place; so, my vote low. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a wealthy Greek business shark named Theo Tomasis, who courts and wins the beautiful young widow, Liz Cassidy, of a killed American president. Does it sound familiar? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The cast is not to be criticized. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection, and at least it's a bit of a consolation, having just read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is obviously beautiful and sophisticated in her role as Jackie (in effect), and James Franciscus has the all-American appearance of the President. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie since then, nor do I want to see it again. I seem to remember a lot of bad language and some general crudeness. Otherwise, I suppose it's a sensational and apparently intimate look into the lives of the jet-setters of the rich and famous, who enjoy themselves aboard their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the scenery of the Greek islands is spectacular, the best part of the film. <br /> <br /> Of its kind, it's okay, I suppose. There are no end-of-series films about the Kennedys, which I confess to tuning in from time to time, and not to my credit. This is basically just another one. Much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.
