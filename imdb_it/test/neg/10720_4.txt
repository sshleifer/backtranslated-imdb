Unfortunately this is not as good as any of the other films that Jim Carrey (producer and protagonist) and Brian Grazer have worked together, but it's definitely worth it. Basically Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he is being promoted to a better job. That is until the Dynocorpe company sinks and closes. Now Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni), and their son of course, are struggling with money. No matter what they feel, they can't increase the kind of money they really want. So they start stealing some places. And then they decide to rob the guy who made Dick go crazy, his former boss Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most laughable pieces are when Carrey is in the elevator singing "I Believe I Can Fly" and when he bites someone in a robbery, and is talking to a voice switch (looks like a crappy robot). All right!
