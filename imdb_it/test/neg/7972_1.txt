Kristy Swanson plays an elite elite woman who should have knocked out a television reporter for a bunch of bad guys, but once she sees this poor guy at home playing with her children, she decides to wipe out the whole project the life of the television reporter is spared The victim's life is up for grabs while the people who wanted this reporter killed now want his death for not following his assignment. Here is the basis for a film called Supreme Sanction. <br /> <br /> Supreme waste of time is more like. We see Swanson's character beating, pounding and killing men much older than her. And she always has at least two fifty advantage over the group of murders that cannot, for some reason, eliminate this super woman. Having a woman who takes out and beat all these men makes the movie look so cheerful. It's too predictable once the Swanson character is won anyway, making the movie boring and inept. <br /> <br /> Kristy Swanson is a decent actress, who in her younger days has always been sexy and simple and eyes.Supreme Sanction is not one of her best efforts anyway.
