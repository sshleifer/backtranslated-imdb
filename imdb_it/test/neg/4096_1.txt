Well, for this abomination of a film, I didn't expect anything good. I find it annoying Steve Carell, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good, but there's absolutely no reason to have a sequel. In some ways, this film was even below my expectations, even when I didn't have any. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember the Disney Noah movie with Tony Danza? Well, let's just say that Evan Almighty completely ripped him off in too many ways for the film to be justifiable. In fact, Evan Almighty had the same plot as Noah, with the exception of some technical details, it was nothing but a carbon copy of a far superior film that was actually FUN. <br /> <br /> Another thing, someone got sick of the stupid, non-licentious, redundant one-liners by Wanda Sykes that were literally in every single scene? It was completely ridiculous and dragged the film more and more. <br /> <br /> Although I have practically seen the film ten years earlier (Noah), Evan Almighty must be the most predictable film I've ever seen. I understood the whole film from the beginning to the end within the first five minutes and finally realized that he was ripping off Noah left and right. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, if you're a little unsure whether or not you want to see Evan Almighty, and you're already tired of Jonah Hill playing the same role in every single movie he is in, he appreciated Bruce Almighty, and I don't want to see a predictable, dry, not funny movie with Steve Carell trying to act like Jim Carrey, so please don't see this piece of junk.
