I suppose I should take something like that with a pinch of salt. These lab films (and, yes, they spend a lot of time in the lab), always fail in one dimension: there is an awareness that single people who enjoy playing have discovered secrets beyond anyone's understanding to date. Of course, they pay a price because their experiments have the same deficiencies that dr. Frankenstein. There is always something they have not foreseen. There are so many things, from pure fashion science for young women, to outrageous covers that don't work here. The young woman is certainly attractive and the doctor cannot help herself, but could have been a bit discreet or even made an effort to protect what she was doing. Things go wrong and thanks to this intellect, it acquires enormous power, including an understanding of how it was born. Rock Hudson looks very fit here. However, he never managed to do it in this role. He wanders everywhere with a lot of clich√©s and nonsense that lessens the basic problem. Once he has his revenge, a more suitable thing would be for her to wander and allow him to look for her and destroy her in a grand way.
