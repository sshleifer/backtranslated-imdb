This film is a big problem. It has a lot of predictable storylines and endless feelings from the start. It starts well with a class number but seems to be lost halfway. <br /> <br /> The chemistry on the screen of Surya & Jyothika works really well and a good part of Bhoomika. Why include Vadivelu in it? It totally disappears after a good half hour! Santhanam demonstrates his intelligence again by setting up the play. <br /> <br /> AR songs will last for a while. But he could have done better. Whatever the drawbacks, it is still worth looking at once if you feel alone at home or are looking for a good ride.
