As I watched the EXORCISM OF THE BLACK WATER VALLEY, I encountered such incredibly pessimistic scenarios and dialogues that I was convinced that this had to be a comedy. Some bits of dialogue of choice worthy of a belly laugh: "I ate a rabbit". "I TOLD YOU IT WAS AVAILABLE!" "Are you telling me the devil is in my daughter ?!" <br /> <br /> There are many, many others, but you have to discover these for yourself - if you dare. <br /> <br /> the story explodes in all sorts of directions and things happen that probably shouldn't and everyone seems to be a pervert or a psychopath of some kind (even the Priest). And I didn't even get bad acting. The most notable in this area is the companion who plays Isabelle's father. The director must have just told him to behave as if he had a stick in his @ $$ because this is the general impression you get. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to distance anyone from the BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there is entertainment value to have ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie that makes sense and it's really scary ... well, run don't walk.
