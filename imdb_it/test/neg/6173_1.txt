Truly terrifying waste of space. My friend and I tried to watch this movie at its conclusion, but I had to turn it off about 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies I turned off before the end on one side. <br /> <br /> The script and direction are solid and deeply uninteresting. I wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a stack of scripted scripts from 1983. For example, the irritating voice that threatened the boy on his home phone. I mean seriously. The police would have beat his door within minutes. Scenes and events wash you like turd in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative moves between the characters in an apparently casual manner, breaking the pathetic attempts to construct the characters. Oh and what "characters" are. The protagonist played by Rourke is terrible. He could have just sent a cardboard cut by himself and stayed in bed. After about 60 minutes of the film I had built an absolutely null bond with this character. It is neither nice nor hateful. Only a disfigured mannequin from a shop window that is looking at every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally muttering and emotionless delivery. He is happy? Is sad? Angry? No idea. Only those same dead eyes that stare at you from a disfigured piece of meat. And the Native American theme is simply horrible and useless. <br /> <br /> Good guys are at best unlikely. A boring stereotype of the white collar and a stereotype of his neurotic ex-wife. Cue's archetypal wife with a face-down rifle with the villain, "you're not going to shoot me" which is both annoyingly original and annoying. <br /> <br /> The character of Richie nix seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating unilateral psychopathic character. Which seems to be in contrast with the apparent intention of making the villains somehow likeable or at least realistically motivated. The character of Roasario Dawsons begins with some promise but soon descends into a disgusting and childish parody of Jackie Brown's gangster chick scenes. Do you really want her to believe that her character was so attracted to Rourke? Or worse, is she just an owl sleeping with everything that moves? FTW Realistic Female Characters! <br /> <br /> In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterizations and performances. A leaden and minced script and an uninspired direction. And in the end extremely boring. His comedy isn't bad either. Laughing at Rourkes's distraught face becomes rather old after having spent the first 15 minutes of the film's swelling.
