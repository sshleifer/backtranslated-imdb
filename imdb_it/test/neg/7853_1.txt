I can't see how someone who has actually read the mysteries of M. Didius Falco can make such a joke. An Australian has no business in Ancient Rome. Nothing in the books is in this film except for the setting and characters, and they are wasted on a fairly thin plot through which to read the silly script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have many nerves that show their names in the credits.
