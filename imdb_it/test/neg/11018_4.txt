This totally UNFunny movie is so exaggerated and pathetic and unrealistic that during all the 90 minutes of total torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times! Lucy Bell is much taller than this shit and for her to sink so low is pretty depressing. I have to admit that the entire audience I was in was laughing hysterically, but most were Greek or Italian, so I guess this humor will probably make them laugh, but not me. This whole movie makes you sick to watch all these slackers apologize for their stupid actions for 90 minutes. God, and I'll never get those 90 minutes back!
