First, few colleges allow students to take courses from their parents' lover. Secondly, few female professors sleep with the dorms' cooks. Third, few cops get a dad who cooks in their dorm. Fourth, once a SECOND member of a small group of college groups encounters a violent death, the college president will dissolve the entire class, and will NOT turn a blind eye as the professor cheerfully leads the rest of the group to deadly deaths . Since the supernatural elements of CULT make absolutely no sense, it is useful to study the trivial content of this film to really appreciate how much this shot really sucks!
