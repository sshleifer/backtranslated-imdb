With actors like Depardieu and Richard it's really a difficult task to make a boring film. But Weber is a master at setting a slow pace and making seemingly fun scenes without any ingenuity and depth. This film is rich in history but low in character. You never met any of the characters except for a superficial farce. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what slapstick is. His style could be described randomly. Obviously some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor in this lot. It's a pity how bad his talent is. Many good French comedians have been wiped out by mediocre directors.
