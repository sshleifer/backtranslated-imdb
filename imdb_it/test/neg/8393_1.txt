If it's an art and nonfiction movie, there's not enough art, not to mention essay. <br /> <br /> If it's a thriller, there's not enough thriller. <br /> <br /> If it's a teenage drama, there's not enough drama, and as for teenagers, there's not enough NOFX and too much Nino Rota. <br /> <br /> I thought it might be a trailer for Tony Hawk's next film, but there's no Tony Hawk, so I guess I've been tricked: it's not a biopic of Tony Hawk. <br /> <br /> If it is an action movie, it lacks explosions, which would have added some interest to it, or at least they would have blown up those asleep in their chairs. <br /> <br /> Most of the characters seem to have died inside, but it's not a zombie movie. In fact, if it's a movie, there's not enough plot. If it's not a movie, it takes too long to be a music video. <br /> <br /> If it's a music video, well ... it's an album I won't buy
