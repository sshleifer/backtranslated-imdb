OK, this film was the worst display I've seen in years. The actors weren't bad (I thought it was a b-movie, so they were acting in a b-movie). Anyway, I saw this movie, thinking, OH COOL a UFO science fiction movie. MISTAKEN. It was just an excuse for radical Christians to push a message about people. The last scene was extremely messy. It's a horrible thing to do to a person to make him believe in something. What someone believes is a matter of opinion. This film only shows how corrupt religion is, especially Christianity. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a b-movie, this is not. If you want to see a movie that is trying to brainwash the masses. Well, this is the choice of litter. go straight for this. If you intend to send a message, do it, don't force it. Ridiculous, those people would have abused the media to such an extent. Above all, the Christians.
