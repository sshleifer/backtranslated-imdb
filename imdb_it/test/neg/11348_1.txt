I just finished watching an episode (S1- # 5 A boy in a bush), so maybe my review isn't very right. <br /> <br /> But based on that episode, this is a very poor version of CSI, acting is crap. The main character, Dr, whatever his name, is so fake that it actually hurts. I wouldn't have thrown it to make an add for dog food! <br /> <br /> The other painful thing is David Boreanaz of fame "Angel", a good actor, does a great job, but wastes coz of that woman's idiotic acting. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is OK, but everything is ruined due to this stupid acting by Emily Deschanel. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing version of CSI, very sorry to see appears on the filmography of some of the potential talents involved in it. <br /> <br /> That woman is really sh # t, at least in that episode. But based on this point of view, I won't even invest to look at it even if it were shown on an elevator.
