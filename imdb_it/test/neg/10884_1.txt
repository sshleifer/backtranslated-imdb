I've seen a lot of movies. In fact I love horror films B, they are one of my favorite genres. However this "junk" (I refuse to acknowledge that this was given the honor of the film) was the worst piece of shit I've ever had the torture to watch. Actually I signed up on IMDb simply because I needed a way to at least say how awful this "junk" was. I saw "Film" (They at least deserve the honor) made in the basements by high school students who were better written and directed. I have nothing but pity for the poor actors in this "junk" because they were just trying to earn a check. Now and forever they will have this stain on their records like a virgin who has been raped and given to Herpes! If the writer / director John Shiban no longer has any dignity, having obviously shot down countless people to do so, he should never approach a camera and try to apply his so-called "gifts" to something more suitable for him .. . How to clean the floor of a Peep Show !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
