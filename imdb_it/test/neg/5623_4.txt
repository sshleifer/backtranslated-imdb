Quentin Tarantino's boyfriend in crime Roger Avary (co-writer of "Pulp Fiction") ventures out on his own (QT airs to prod. This time) for this over-branded French thriller. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz is Zed, an extraordinary safe cracker who moved to France from the United States at the request of an old friend. There he teamed up with a heterogeneous group of drug addicted hippies who, with little or no planning, thought they could throw down a bank vault full of gold bars at a French national holiday. <br /> <br /> Avary has reworked the Theft theme has gone wrong that Tarantino has developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs", only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive with the strength of this, so Avary threw in quite a distraction. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a girl called by a girl who entertains Zed on her arrival in Paris. A surprising distraction that certainly is, but nothing more. <br /> <br /> I believe our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately the move did not help to add depth to his surface texture so desperately needed. There was never a story in this idea, which was nothing but an idea. Even the surreal journey on the squalid diving in Paris is not interesting. I imagine we must admit that there has never been much in the history of a group of gangsters who shoot each other on a mischievous jewelry robber, that is, until intricate characters and snappy dialogues are added. "Reservoir Dogs" has it, "Killing Zoe" no. <br /> <br /> Stoltz's strong interpretation of the doubt Zed and the mad portrait of Jean Hughes-Anglade of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift the proceedings. In short, Avary has tried in vain to evoke entertainment from nothing. <br /> <br /> Friday, 15 September 1995 - Astor Theater
