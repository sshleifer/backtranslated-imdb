Just seen which way to the front? on TCM (United Kingdom) is a really terrible film. If I had paid for the photos I would have gone out. <br /> <br /> A terrible mess of a movie. Byers (Lewis) and his companions jump around in uniform from an Italian science fiction movie of the '60s. The badges of the CND / Peace symbol on the uniforms were ironic? The sets were pure in 1970, I'm sure a Hollywood TV back-back could have provided a more realistic set. <br /> <br /> The film is full of racism. The film takes the mickey from the veterans. <br /> <br /> It is not strange how Lewis managed to make another film outside of me.
