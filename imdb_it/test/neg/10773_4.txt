I'm not quite sure I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney a very calm and apparently lazy aristocrat. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be full of overwhelming energy and volatility. I didn't like Houdini's style, James Bond, Mission Impossible that Sir Percy designed. In previous versions, the spirit was the tool for escape, not technology. Nor were the characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin adequately represented. There seems to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I don't want to assign any blame, because perhaps the reason why my dislike for this film could simply be a matter of difference in interpretation. If the director's interpretation coincided with mine, perhaps I would not have been irritated by what appeared to me to be bad portraits of characters. <br /> <br /> I much prefer the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite as efficient as the imperturbable, calm FOP. So were Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this period seems to have been lost with this latest adaptation. I suggest to stick to the previous versions, the 1934 or the 1982 one. <br /> <br />
