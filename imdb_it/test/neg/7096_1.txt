When I saw this film I think I am a freshman in high school and I still want to top up Master P for the hour and 20 minutes or so that has taken away from my life that I will never return. <br /> <br /> The guy who has already posted is absolutely right. Master P is a gangster wannabe. He, like all the other rappers in this country, has made his millions of dollars to sell rap CDs to impressionable young white children in this country. It is known that the crowd was not a black thing and blacks were not allowed to be part of it. In an unfair way as they could be the rappers can not face. Does this film paint Master P like a gangster named Nino? The script is terrible with the acting to match. Completely incredible. During the search I found a link or something that said he was planning another movie called "The Black Sopranos" !!!! <br /> <br /> Please spare us and stick to Nickalodeon. You are not a white mafioso, you are not even a good P Master actor, stay true to your music for the good of anyone who hears it these days ...
