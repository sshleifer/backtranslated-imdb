For a country that has produced some of the best playwrights in the world and has such rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of concern for me because so much of Irish national cinema has been so terrifying. Perhaps because, by its very nature, talents in the field of Irish cinema have been ready to abandon their homeland for careers in Britain or America, (Colin Farrell is a recent example), and that the Irish directors of great success that they continued to work in Ireland and with Irish subjects they made their films with international money and an eye on the international market. I am thinking in particular of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan who alternate between films with an Irish setting and projects shot abroad. <br /> <br /> "Middletown", however, is an Irish film even though two of its main actors are English It is certainly well done in its genre and could be against the trend that Irish films are not really very good; (Paddy Breathnach's Went Downs, written by the brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a crucial exception). Unfortunately this story of fundamentalism set in a fictitious Irish city, presumably in the north of Ireland to judge by accents, (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me), and presumably in the recent past, (Fifties?), it's so exaggerated that it's really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Nothing in the movie sounds real and you can't help but feel that the writer, Daragh Carville, was strongly influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing could have made more sense if had been set in the American biblical belt and not in Ireland where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist was never as crazy as this. It meant being as severe in a grandiose way as Guignol and certainly it is, although I was more prone to laughter than Frisson's to the right of Reverand Matthew Macfayden's antics. He has the Ulster accent and there is nothing wrong with his acting or that of Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays's wife but the script is so terribly derived that the acting can do nothing to save the film. So, rather than a step forward for Irish cinema, "Middletown" is, I fear, just another nail in his coffin.
