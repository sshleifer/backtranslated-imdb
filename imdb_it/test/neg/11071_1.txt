I agreed to watch this film with a group of friends despite my extreme dislike of horror movies. However, it was not the shock of a monster that turned me away from this film, it was the horrendous acting and the absolutely disgusting ending. Inside, or the Cavern, it has no redemptive qualities - it is badly done, ridiculous in the script, bloody bloody and the inclusion of the free final scene disgusts me. No, it's not my dislike of the horror films that make me hate this movie - I've seen horrors of teenagers as wonderful as "House of Wax", it's the fact that the film leaves you with the terrible understanding that renting the video , you are supporting the creators of Within
