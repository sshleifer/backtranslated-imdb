Ramsay ?? the kings of comedy (or horror, whatever) woke up after years of hibernation. And yes, I got scared. No, not because of the horror element (obviously I'm not that picky), but because the rats constantly danced standing in the khatmal-chaap theater (where otherwise these films run). <br /> <br /> Then check the plot. A man is repeatedly stabbed, choked to death, stuffed with plastic and dumped in a pool. But back again for revenge. Now was the film a thriller or a horror? This is the suspense that you must discover. And the end turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember those undercover agents of the Ramsay brand ?? men wearing some stupid horror masks. Only here is the mask of a human being. I suppose no further details are needed to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> Amarr Upadhyay tends to become too dramatic and theatrical, forgetting the difference between cinema and TV soap. Aditi Gowitrikar, with her typical pink lipstick, looks typically extravagant and looks like .. (Uh! You know what). <br /> <br /> The background score is a Psycho forehand by Alfred Hitchcock. Not a single department of the film, both technical and creative, deserves to be commented. The novelty is missing both in history and in execution. <br /> <br /> Dhund certainly clouds the senses.
