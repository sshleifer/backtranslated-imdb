First I loved the book, more than the most popular Da Vinci Code and although the DVC film was not well received, I liked it and bought the DVD. However, there is no chance that I ever want to see Angles and Demons again. <br /> <br /> The film barely resembles the book, in fact only the general premise of the story is there. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film I was disappointed, in the book Robert Langdon receives a phone call and a fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Who finds the body of Father (he doesn't remember the name) and then asks Langdon to come, using the super fast plane ... In the book the only people who knew this technology that the team of Father and Daughter had created were themselves and the chamberlain ... In the film, however, there was a great team involved ... so the tension had never been there ... as they discovered etc. <br /> <br /> Leaving or rather changing this whole part of the story was a big mistake and it was in my mind what made a poor movie ... it changed everything that happened since then, when the Camerlingo found himself in front of the closed room of the Pope, Maximilian Kohler should have been the one who shot the video from his wheelchair, the commander rushed inside to get the chamberlain but he was shot by Olivetti, in the film he was the commander in the room and Olivetti was fired ... (err I think I understood correctly, but I was bored and I don't really remember the events of the film) ... There was no love interest between the two with Vittoria and Roberto and in the book she he was not at Cern when he arrived and was really taken away from his research work. In the book all four preferred were killed, but in the film the last of the four survived the fountain. In the book Victoria was kidnapped and Robert had to save her and it was they who killed the Assassin in the Church of the Illuminati, not blown up like in the Camerlingo movie. There was no piece in which Robert was locked up under a stone coffin, saved by Mickey's watch alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon escaped from the helicopter, just enough to say that this was a little too tense, but it was important in the film, because he had to go back with the film ... there was no talk of how Vittoria and his adoptive father were involved, this was also important to know the character of Victoria. <br /> <br /> In all the worst movies I've seen, I would have left early, but my brain went numb and I temporarily lost the use of my legs. A real attempt to reeeeeeaaaaaalylyllyly and not one of the best of Ron Howards, in fact, the way he will return to work is beyond me !!! I want my money back !!!
