Now don't get me wrong, I love bad movies ... No, I love bad movies, Troll 2 .... painful ouch, Manos The Hands of Fate ... just watch Torgo go, Guru the Mad Monk .. it's that noise traffic on the medieval background? OK, that's clear, but this is one of those movies that obviously tried to be something better, but it didn't make it. Why not? Well, it would be easy to blame the plot, but heh we've seen worse, there were not too many holes and heh I know there's not much originality in it, but then there's no need to kill a movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is OK, the truck quite threatening, so where did it go wrong? Well, I'd like to blame Harley like "Chris Moyles" ... so I'll do it! Comedy and horror are hard to mix well, bad comedy and horror even worse and there's the problem. I hated this guy from the moment he raised his head (literally), Adam's continued overly mild becoming annoying, so annoying that you lose the belief that milder people don't react by pushing him out of the moving car ... I thought they were the monstrous pieces that the director should have had trouble convincing us. Why are bad movies funny? Well, you have a lot of fun sticking holes in it, laughing at the script, all the screamer, etc. This film does not make the coveted category of "worst films" because it is just bad because of being annoying. Don't bother, go and look at nothing else and you'll be a better person for this ... I promise! (Fade to the songs of Torgo Torgo Torgo)
