The videotape for "Joyride" says "played by second-generation superstars" and you can't help but feel sad. Of course, Melanie Griffith has moved on to bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So, with that pathetic attention grabbing the box, I was foolish enough to buy the film for a dollar thinking I would be in the land of "such bad guys - they're good movies from the 70s. Eh, not so much. While so many movies of the 70s youth aimlessly (or simple films of the 70s of the genre) have tried so hard to say something profound and meaningful, 'Joyride' does not even try. It is only without purpose. It is devoid of any interest. character is conceived so badly that it is no wonder these actors seem so lazy, in short, the film is about twenty year olds going to Alaska to start a business, but they are robbed and then I have to find work. "They eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. It's all very typical, but what's more, it's done in the most trivial way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the characters' actions are ta largely ambiguous that you can lose several scenes and not occupy yourself at all. <br /> <br /> But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then this is a must see. It is still not enough to get this above the lowest score I can give. <br /> <br /> Best Line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * outside ****
