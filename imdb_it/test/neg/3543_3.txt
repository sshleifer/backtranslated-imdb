Nightscream is a TV movie, so it's going to be pretty awful, especially since it's supposed to be a horror movie. This girl is obsessed with dreams as she arrives in a small town where a year ago there was a murder of a woman. She is amazed when everyone in the city thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl. Citizens are amazed when he continues to enter the dream as a trance in which he reveals accurate details about the murder and the murderer because the police apparently did everything wrong. Thinking they are in danger of being discovered, the killers (there are two) are starting to come up with a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the truth. At this point you will probably fall asleep and because the film's creators have the full-blown 'mist-making' machine in dream sequences.
