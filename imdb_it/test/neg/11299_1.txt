Synopsis: the sequel to the acclaimed Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal is a large-budget production that it fails to deliver; not only is it not as smart as its predecessor, it's not even a splatter or a suspense or horror movie, just a totally boring waste of time. Don't be fooled by the media hype, and in particular the stories of people throwing themselves into the cinema and mentally scarred for the rest of their lives because of the brain eating scene: in the film it is found as a ridiculous SFX. Because so many people in this forum claim that H is "not all bad" and "worth watching on the big screen", etc., it's beyond me; and it's not "so bad it's okay", it's simply boring. Usually I respect the opinion of other people, but in this case I must say that clearly they cannot say **** from Shine - Ola. Perhaps they have fallen prey to the media hype, perhaps they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and been impressed by its excessive use of backlight, smoke and the ubiquitous AC fans. H is totally free of suspense; instead we get endless scenes of Lecter crossing an English-speaking Florence, an absolutely unconvincing and non-engaging plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually woke up half the night trying to find all the holes in the plot and when I wrote them, I quickly filled 6 pages in small characters before forcing me to stop). Rather than wasting time and money seeing it on the big screen, I suggest you wait until it arrives on TV in a couple of years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. <br /> <br /> Below are a couple of extra bones I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - It's the sequel to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum are claiming. And although SOTL was a very difficult act to follow, there are sequels that are comparable to their predecessors (the same SOTL was the sequel to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris's "Red Dragon", and although the first The episode was a very funny film, SOTL was even better, another example would be the Alien series started by the director of H Ridley Scott - so much for the theory of sequels in decline). In any case, being a sequel is no excuse for a movie to be crap. <br /> <br /> - This film has a famous director, is based on a novel by the same author of SOTL, the cast is strictly A-list, great cinematography, big budget, first-rate screenwriters, yadda, yadda , yadda, and the end result is simply a fart in the church. So what went wrong? I think most of the blame should go to the film's producer, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter", which, despite all its qualities, was a commercial flop. Disappointed, he gave the rights to the character of Hannibal Lecter in Orion - for free, allowing Jonathan Demme to make SOTL, and the rest is the history of cinema. The DDL had to wait another ten years (it is now 81 years old) until Thomas Harris finally invented the sequel novel. I think at this point the DDL has lost all interest in making a good movie and is desperate to finally get its slice of the cake before it opens its cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I find completely annoying is that this film is given so much undeserved fanfare in the media; I mean, it's boring, yet one of the highest-grossing productions ever, so there's no need to give it free publicity. And while most reviewers complain about how Dantema is the Florence scene and why Jodie Foster did not participate, the mere fact that this film is a total, absolute flop, UTTER, is not mentioned. But there's more: not only is Hannibal projected on the stage, but it is also used as a media agenda for a plethora of "documentaries" (usually left behind by similar productions in the wake of SOTL) on serial killer, cannibalism and profiling. However, not only does H not even pretend to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (who now kills only out of necessity, or to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL, so there is no need to create a profile) and there is 'it is also no cannibalism: Lecter feeds the drug addict Paul Krendler of his own brain, so this makes him (erm) unaware alive - self-cannibalism. Try making a documentary about this. <br /> <br /> - Much has been said about acting: mainly if Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays the role of Hannibal Lecter) usually gets a lot of praise. I think all these discussions are questionable. There are many of my favorite actors in this film (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore) but the script simply doesn't give them anything to work with. Same for Hopkins: there is no development in his character, and he is not questioned in any way. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, except that in H he has to make the strange piece of murder and the tidy sum of $ 11 million is paid to do it.
