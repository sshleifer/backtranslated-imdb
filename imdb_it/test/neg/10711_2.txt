The producers ask for a huge suspension of disbelief, grant it to them in the hope that, given a little time, they will convince you that it is possible. Alas, with TV movies it looks like they are preparing specifically to make cheap Cosmo questionnaires. With a small budget and big credits, you should spend every penny on the details to convince the public. Not here though. The film gets some points for the good performance that the two main women give against the odds, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. oh, the less I said about the end, the better. Enjoy the movie at all!
