The initial scene of the Fircombe beach, while having fun in itself, unfortunately provides a metaphor suitable for the film, insipid and faded. It's actually not as trivial as most of the others in the Carry On series, but maybe because of that it doesn't offer much fun. It is a bet that the title will appeal to fans of the Benny Hill show, but those looking for attractive women in bikinis and miniskirts will see some of the other titles in the series, like "Carry On Abroad" or "Carry On Up the Jungle "more. The emergence of feminism in the early 1970s is used as a plot device that seems rather counterproductive.
