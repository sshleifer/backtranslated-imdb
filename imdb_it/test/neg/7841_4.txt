Although predictable and artificial, it's not a bad movie. Entertains, which is all that Van Damme hopes to do. The ubiquitous "twin" device is again used (as in a large number of Van Damme films) but is not annoying except for long-time fans. Natasha is beautiful and worth watching. The action is decent, nothing spectacular for Van Damme but exciting. I can recommend Van Damme fans and even those who are not, but don't mind an action movie with a beautiful prominent couple. The Russian Mob is a pleasant and current concept for the day. Clearly, it's not his best film, but not his worst.
