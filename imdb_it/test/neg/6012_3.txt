Terrible adaptation of Heminway's low-profile love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during the First World War. What's wrong with that? Practically everything. Hudson is WAY out of his depth here. He could be a good actor but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (he's 21 in the book - here she is at 38 ... and look!). Even his acting wavered between exaggerated and subdued! They took a simple low-key romance and they completely disproportionate it. The film is fatally long (just over 150 minutes), self-indulgent and ridiculously stuffed. It seems that producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing "Gone with the wind" again. Some of the landscapes are really amazing (even on a small TV screen) but there is not enough history to match them to the images. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The ending where Jones dies should be tragic, but bad acting and exaggerated theatricality made me fight to keep from laughing! <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the actor Vittorio De Sica escapes from a really embarrassing degree. Overwhelmed, self-indulgent, poorly pronounced and slow. Pretty terrible. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You might want to tune in to a scenario at the end, but it's not worth it. I give this a 3.
