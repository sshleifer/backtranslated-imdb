Theft is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen seem to want to get away with it. I haven't even seen this movie, but not only do I know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another movie, or 2 movies for that matter, is such crap (and if IMDb would have allowed far more profanity than just bullshit) that I feel full of anger and I feel like I have to throw myself out of the window and finish everything. O.k is a bit too much but theft is worse. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Pontypool? It was this fantastic little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio host goes to work, and then this zombie attack happens. Let's just see what's happening inside the radio station, and the only assumption we have about what's happening outside is the occasional call from their eyes in the sky Ken Loney (easily the most fun time in the movie in my mind) and the BBC asking for an update on the situation. From all the reviews I read and from the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this movie and Pontypool) this film was exactly like in the story, with small changes here and there. So throw the originality and creativity out the window. As for the zombies or the infected, whatever you want to call them. They are the exact same thing, just because they have been infected does not change the fact that they walk without mind, and have an endless extinction for the meat. I'm Zombies. ZOMBIE !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIE !!! One to many is fine, but let's get back to this lousy movie. The zombies of what I heard are very similar to those of 28 days later, another better film, with their mad rage and even more insane extinction of the flesh. This is where the Zombie movies are defined, the story doesn't matter in a zombie movie (as long as you haven't taken the idea of ​​another movie). Of course, a zombie movie can be improved by history, as in the case of Pontypool, but the zombies must be, in a sense, original. 28 days later, the mad, enraged Zombie started. Pontypool I can't even start explaining those guys without ruining the movie. The Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is type in the name again because, come on, it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the master, and he went through all the different types of zombies, from the zombies with the face painted in Dawn of the Dead to the impetuous zombies in Diary of the Dead, and he made each of them with his unique style. <br /> <br /> So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time to explain why I hate this movie without even seeing it. This film rightly steals the original profile of the story from Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people are expelled from school to do just that, but in Hollywood it is allowed and apparently approved. This is not the only film that incorporates the scheme of another film, and only tries to say it differently. The 90s are like the worst period for movies ever, sure that it had some gems but that it is not, and it is because all the films were exactly the same. My favorite, the crime film with such a big twist that you'll never guess it until the end. They force you to feed on a suspect, it seems impossible that no one is apart from him, then, bam, this whole time was this guy, you just had to watch the scenes where he wasn't there and then when he would mysteriously appear out of the blue, say "hey guys, what did I miss?" OH! YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT YOU DID YA! Well, I'll leave a cliché as a concluding statement. This is a film that you will surely want to lose.
