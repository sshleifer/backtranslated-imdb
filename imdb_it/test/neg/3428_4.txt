The story of Farewell to the King is intriguing. An American "deserter" (I had the impression that he and his 3 companions were just trying to escape capture in the Philippines while their desperate escape from the raft towards Borneo is not the classic desertion). But as soon as they reach the shore when they are discovered by the Japanese. The character of Nolte (a sergeant) only moments before walked along the beach alone and was not noticed. And incredibly no one noticed his footprints in the sand that would lead the Japanese to him. But anyway, Nolte is greeted by a tribe of headhunters and becomes their king after defeating another member of the tribe. So it's out of the war. Then the British commandos show up and want the tribe to assist them in the fight against the Japanese. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Nolte's incessant hamming ruins an interesting story. Instead of acting like a former soldier back in the war, now with a tribe of warriors under his command, Nolte acts as if he was raised by the tribe. He speaks as if English were almost a foreign language, rarely using contractions. He makes large gestures when he speaks and behaves as if he were one with nature, as if he had grown up in the jungle. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and lots of interesting scenes with the English interacting with Nolte and the tribe. But the character of Nolte is never credible. He always seems to be exaggerating. He must have been a bit more of an American soldier and much less of a tribe. As it is, he comes across not as a royal king, but as a madman who has forgotten who he really is. But this is not the intent of the film, as the script admired and appreciated it by the British commandos. There is never any suggestion that the British thought his behavior was strange. It is simply seen by the English as the de facto chief of the tribe. Therefore, it always seems that the character of Nolte is not suitable for what should happen in the film. <br /> <br /> Another actor could have done a great job with the role, he would have believed in his lines and he would have made it an exceptional film. But Nolte ruins the film by mopping up every scene and not seeming to understand what his character should be. <br /> <br /> What a waste.
