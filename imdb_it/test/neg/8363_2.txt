I rarely see a film with such a cast, a potentially strong story based on a best seller that was so weak and somewhat unwatchable ... <br /> <br /> The premise of a story reads like a The novel by Brent Easton Ellis - a lot of drugs, desperation and self-induced tragedy as a young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to be a suicidal loser, who doesn't seem to accept the fact that she is living a good life and that basically it is pathetic to be so small ... <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci is not only playing a tragic character, but also a tragic actor, whose sobs and cries for most of the movie actually make you come urge to scream - kill yourself already and let us go to the end credits in rotation ... The director is not helpful since it provides absolutely no rhythm and the story seems so bumpy that you have no idea what this damn really is ta girl of. The director was apparently on Prozac when he was directing this imitation of a film and then let the film go by autopilot making it an unbearable disaster. <br /> <br /> The only saving features are a nice Jason Biggs, like Wurtzel's boyfriend (which fortunately I decided to download the self-centered egocentric self-indulgent) and an incredible good Jessica Lange as the mother of the combi. Apparently Lange cannot be overthrown by a terrible script, directors and co-actors. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I don't know if this is really who Wurtzel was or was, but the film made me totally uninterested in his writings. <br /> <br /> In the end I finished watching this movie and immediately started thinking: OK. It's time to look at something, which actually involves REAL problems ...
