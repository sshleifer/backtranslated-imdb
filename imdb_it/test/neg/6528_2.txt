.... and now I'm ready for episode n. I really hoped it would be over by now (not to mention the cancellations, once everything connected to the show - including the actors) had been dumped along with some toxic waste somewhere in the ocean, never to be seen), because this series is really terrible. <br /> <br /> Putting this program under the genre of "comedy" is misleading! It's so hard to believe that Ben Elton can write something so ugly, maybe this indicates a lot of input from other writers in everything he was connected to before. In some episodes I didn't even laugh once! <br /> <br /> Oh, and I can't believe Ardal O'Hanlon stopped doing "My Hero" and started doing it, his decision-making skills were obviously altered that day - maybe he just can't read, and did not realize how scarce the scripts of "Blessed" were. Don't get me wrong, "My Hero" is not a masterpiece, but it is a million times better than this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> And just to annoy me even more, I bet this version will have a DVD as well, when there are so many fantastic TV series that are not published!
