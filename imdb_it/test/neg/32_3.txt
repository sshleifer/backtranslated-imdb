This film seems well made and further efforts should be made to promote films by women. Apart from this, this film is also deeply disturbing as it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character who is deeply troubled. If you've seen something from the promotional material, you might think this is a touching film about a relationship that came to an end, but none of them suggests how disturbing the central premise is: <br /> <br /> A woman threatens the suicide unless he is soon his ex agrees to relive here the most precious memories of their relationship. When he said how unjust (to say the least) that this threat is, Tessa (the alleged protagonist) suggests that "life is not right". <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to manipulate his former lover to stay, and persuades him into sexually oriented behavior (which he initially denies as a motive) all the while assuring him "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Reversing genres, having the roles played by Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and this could be released in full-length on Lifetime with a title like "Hostage to Obsession". There is no medically accepted definition of a solid mental and emotional stability that would understand Tessa's behavior in this film. <br /> <br /> Bet on Kristen Thomson to play a former psychotic and borderline manipulative, perhaps too well because there is not a well-adapted person, male or female, who can watch this and not have the chills that run along the back.
