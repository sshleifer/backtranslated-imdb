This movie is really bad. I like to shoot TV while taking a nap and this movie seemed to be something nice to sleep, and the boy was wrong. My body literally woke me from sleep and said "hey ... this movie is horrible ... you have to watch it". I love bad movies with bad actors and silly plots. Something about involuntary comedy keeps me going. This film is incredibly lousy. I really don't know how to express it correctly, besides recommending looking at it just to see how bad it is. I mean, seriously, you should watch it with people. I was making the best jokes during this movie and no one was there to hear them. <br /> <br /> Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
