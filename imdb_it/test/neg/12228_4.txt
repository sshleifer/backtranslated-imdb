It was only a matter of time that a parody of sports films would have been made! And there are lots of movies to watch that are made fun. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that it remains in recognizing films. The director and writers of "The Comebacks" somehow forget about being creative. While I have to admit that I laughed in certain scenes, "The Comebacks" could have been a lot more fun. The actors forget to seriously deliver their lines and have a straight face throughout the film. A parody requires this and this is the main reason why stupid jokes work in films like this. Due to the cast's failure to do so, the jokes never left their mark. Some scenes take forever and normally in parody that shouldn't be a problem. Take "Naked Gun" for example. Their is always something that happens on the screen. In "The Comebacks" they didn't even bother to let things happen in the background. Only a couple of factors make this movie worth seeing! It's still fun to see the movies you enjoyed. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody of Cuba Gooding Jr. as Radio was hilarious! He seems to be the only one in the cast to get an idea of ​​what a parody is. Not all bad!
