When a group of businessmen begins to die in the presence of the mysterious Mr. Coulomb, FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. While the deaths continue to rise, Mr. Martin is obviously not having much success. At the end of the film, the strange truth is revealed, which I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> One of the other users who commented on this article "This is a classic movie and should be FUN and not chosen separately". I'm sorry but I respectfully disagree with this opinion. It is "classic" only because it is old, not in any sense relevant to its quality. I have enjoyed a lot of low budget "B" movies from this time, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> The pace is unbearably slow, the camera work is rather bland, most of the acting is quite wooden (even Lugosi is not big in this in my opinion) and the plot, despite having a premise interesting, it seems to be put together in a very difficult way to follow.
