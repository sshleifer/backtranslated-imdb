When I voted for my "1" for this film I noticed that 75 people voted the same on 146 total votes. This means that half of the people who voted for this film feel it's really terrible. I saw this not long ago at a film festival and I was not at all impressed by its poor performance. Cinematography is unwatchable, the sound is bad, the story is cut and pasted by many other films and the acting is terrible. This film is basically a bad review of three other films. NO WONDER HAS NEVER BEEN RELEASED IN THE USA.
