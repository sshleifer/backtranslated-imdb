Joe was released for the first time in the United States in the summer of 1970. Despite respectable notes, the reasonable box office and an Oscar nomination, vanished shortly thereafter and remained forgotten during the 1980s, before being resumed with enthusiasm, in somewhat unfairly, in the United States in the late 1990s. Thanks to this long unavailability, his reputation went to see him (inexplicably) next to those of the original Death Wish by Michael Winner. Even if revenge is a theme, a film on vigilantism is certainly not. <br /> <br /> The plot is not worth summing up. It is a flaccid, bitter and bizarre trifle that speaks of an accidental murder and of the unlikely relationship that arises from it. That relationship and the largely classic oddities of its two derivations are exaggerated in ridiculous caricatures; these two, and their situation, have absolutely no relation to reality. <br /> <br /> Almost the whole film is irascible and begrudgingly antiquated, which makes it completely fascinating. Hippies are depicted as snants and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs or they make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face, and most young women are ready to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana on the fly. It's a film from the 1960s rather than the 1970s, so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of Hollywood's New Wave is a complete mystery. Even Martin Scorcese was involved with all the people, though probably only to nod to the wet and washing tones of gloomy urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe seems very similar to a furious tirade against characters like Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than a continuation of the same film insurgent ethos. <br /> <br /> It is not a film of any real artistic significance - despite Joe's incontinent fury for all that in his world remains a story with absolutely nothing - but its value as a piece of cultural museum is unprecedented . Shot on and around the streets of New York during the darkest hours of the Vietnam War, and at a time when America (and, significantly, its cinema) was revolutionizing due to the horror of the old guard, the film ends, in its completely oblivious and accidental way, saying more about that period in the history of numerous infinitely superior films that sought directly to capture it. <br /> <br /> But how about a movie? Despite a really surprising and effective shock end, this is basically a Michael Winner film, but not so well done. How do you tease your imagination? ** Incidentally, if you are, like me, a fan of spotting arbitrary background support, then take a look at Harold Steptoe at 1:22:11 in the hippy art gallery.
