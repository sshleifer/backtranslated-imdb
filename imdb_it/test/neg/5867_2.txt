I bought this DVD for my young son who loves ToyStory movies. I never expected it to be in the same league as the Toystory films, but what I got was just another Disney cartoon, far below what I expected from Disney / Pixar. The story is not original, the characters are boring and two-dimensional, the animation is below average, even Buzz is not great. The film could have been much better. In particular, I hated paint with the texture of numbers. I know it's meant for children, but even children know when something stinks at this level of lameness. <br /> <br /> Although I liked some aspects of the film, I really liked the opening section of the film, with the mutant slag, it just went downhill from there.
