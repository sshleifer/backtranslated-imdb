The film is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are too many times when you see blurred and highly modified scenes. You could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur video camera and $ 100 video editing software. Right on the ground, the man on the street does not mean sloppy editing. Unfocused scenes that do not contain important statements should have been deleted. The same applies to ensuring that the head / hand / other objects remain in the frame. The 8-year-old son knows by now. <br /> <br /> The film is too long. The main point (anti globalization) is included after 30 minutes, because worrying about everything else. After the interview with James Suckling I pressed the "stop" button. What a life of time. <br /> <br /> The main theme no longer works for me. I have seen too many small wineries that produce mediocre and marketed wines and many large wineries that produce exceptional and unique wines. The film identifies small producers like those who produce wines with more identity or terroir. The older ones are accused of producing "internationalized" or "marketed" wines. The film is trying to make a black and white statement in a world full of shades of gray. However, the film did not prove this claim. They look at a couple of sporadic examples, they "bind" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provide "interviews" to key people. Well, have all the small producers spent the Second World War in the resistance? Is it important to see that Parker has a thing with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
