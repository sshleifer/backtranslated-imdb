For me it is inconceivable how someone could have enjoyed or laughed at this film. I would say it's the worst movie I've seen in years and I see many. Did I forget the averages? It's also very difficult to believe that this is the same Jeff Daniels doing a brilliant performance by George Washington in The Crossing. It seems that since he made Dumber, he went into the tank. Can you believe he even wrote and directed this stuff?
