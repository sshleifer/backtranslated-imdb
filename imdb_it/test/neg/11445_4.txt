A young woman, Jodie Foster, is witnessing a mafia murder, reports the killing to the local police and becomes a target hit by the mobsters herself. A professional murderer, Dennis Hopper, hired by the Mafia, is chasing her to prepare for success, but eventually falls in love with her. Then, as a parody of the Stockholm Syndrome that defines a case in which a kidnapped hostage begins to like and collaborates with the kidnapper, Jodie Foster falls in love with her captor, makes love, and both prepare for a vacation. <br /> <br /> Denis Hopper, the actor, tries to align himself with the creative ambitions of Dennis Hopper, the director. The result is disappointing and cannot keep up with the artistic level of a great artist like Dennis Hopper. There is no real emotion and the script is sometimes naive and predictable. The film is partly saved by the performance of Jodie Foster who is not at his best, but still shines with his talent, his beauty and his gift. Of historical interest is the short appearance of Vincent Price, and, in a small act, of Charlie Sawn known for his large part in "Wall Street". <br /> <br /> If you decide to spend the 116 minutes to watch the movie, it's not a complete loss; this film offers easy entertainment, but we would expect much more from the "Easy Rider" director, and the actress who gave us the character of Sarah Tobias in "The Accused".
