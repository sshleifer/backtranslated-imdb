** Black Dragons (1942) William Nigh ~ Bela Lugosi, Joan Barclay, Clayton Moore <br /> <br /> "Just before the start of World War II, Dr. Melcher (Bela Lugosi), a renowned surgeon World was introduced by the Japanese Black Dragon Society as part of a secret plan. Dr. Melcher works on six Black Dragon Society agents and turns them into exact duplicates of 6 high-level American businessmen who are replaced by these doubles "In order, the Black Dragon Society's plan to sabotage the American war effort seems to be fixed, but the head of the FBI and an agent are beginning to put together the hints that they hopefully discover this sinister plot," according to the synopsis of the DVD. > <br /> This synopsis gives the entire final; which, in this case, could be a good thing. "Black Dragons" is an incredible inconsistent mess. A wiser course of action would have been to remain with the provocative supernatural angle. In the first scenes, Mr. Lugosi (like Monsieur Colomb) is really disturbing. Confusing Joan Barclay (as Alice Saunders), the future "Lone Ranger" Clayton Moore (as Dick Martin), along with a cast of old stage and silent veterans do the best they can with a story that seems made by directors like them they went together.
