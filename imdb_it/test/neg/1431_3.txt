What starts out pretty well (and rather scary) sinks quickly into an annoying mess. <br /> <br /> Dee Snider (from Twisted Sister infamy) apparently wrote the script from his own idea, and while the idea of ​​a cyber-stalking piercial monster has potential, they really blow it here on a rhythm irregular, wrong dialogues and one of the biggest non-finals you can ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director runs a really creepy first roller. It really looks like it will be a good low-cost effort. <br /> <br /> I didn't have much luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider's character inexorably spits out the boring psychotic fortune cookie lines that should go through a meaningful dialogue. Worse still, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only credible halfway dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the Internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there's a new Sister song, if you're interested.
