First of all, I must stress that the role played by Wendell Corey was exceptional. Usually, Corey has been relegated to secondary roles, but here is what helps bring this very clear film. Without him and the character he played, the film would have been much worse - almost deserving a 2 or 3. <br /> <br /> So why do I hate the rest of the film so much? Well, one of my pets is when the characters say "too stupid to live". You can't base the main plot points on the assumption that your main characters are completely stupid (unless there's a brain plot in the plot, of course). But that's exactly what happens in this movie. Wendell Corey is a crazed man who murdered three innocent people and knows that his next goal is Joseph Cotten's wife. So what do they do? Yes, they provide really inadequate police protection and a plan that doesn't make any sense (no chosen shooter and guys with shotguns so far probably won't stop this madman). And if this isn't bad enough, the marked woman inexplicably moves away from her hiding place and walks into the worst possible place she could be! Is anyone so stupid?!?! Arrrggghhhh --- I hate when movies have such stupid characters. In fact, I have been rooting for Corey since I heard that idiots deserved to die for their behavior! Besides these common characters, there was also a slightly unconscious player. Of course, seeing your husband shoot could make someone swoon, but in real life this is a rare event - people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason. So combining this with the aforementioned character problems is a real nightmare for people looking for realism - something that Film Noir films MUST have. <br /> <br /> All these serious problems are even more exasperating since the character of Wendell Corey is incredibly well written and conceived. It was his chance to shine as an actor - too bad the rest of the film was so soft that Corey and the basic idea of ​​the plot sank. This is a film that could really use a remake - but this time without mindless characters.
