Bone Eater is set in a small desert town in Alabama where real estate developer Dick Krantz (Jim Storm) is funding the construction of a huge resort. One night late three of his workers Riley (Timothy Starks), Hansen (Adrian Alvarado) and Miller (Paul Rae) are digging foundations in the desert when they discover what looks like a tomahawk ax, unfortunately for them an ancient Native American demon called the eater of bones arrives and kills them. Local sheriff Steve Evans (Bruce Boxleitner) leaves Krantz speechless as the resort building stops, Sheriff Evans must also confront the bone-eating demon that kills anyone he meets ... <br /> <br /> You know that I consider myself a big fan of the horror and science fiction genre, I don't think my opinion is worth more than anyone else's (unlike many here on the Album ...) but please believe me when I say that Bone Eater is the worst " Creature Feature "of the Sci-Fi Channel I've ever seen and that goes against a damn fierce competition. As a fan of horror and science fiction there are two names that when they are involved in a film send me chills in anticipation of how badly it will end, those names are Jesus 'I have no talent' Franco who had nothing to do with Bone Eater and Jim Wynorski who directed the absolute disaster that is Bone Eater. In fact, Bone Eater is so bad that Wynorski hides under the pseudonym of Bob Robertson, when a bad director like Wynorski hides under a pseudonym, you know the film must be bad. Where do I start too? Bone Eater is simply the worst movie I've seen this year and it's so ugly that it's not true, the story is terrible, the script is sloppy (at one point Sheriff Evans tells Kia to meet him at the hospital, but when meet there later acts surprised and says 'what are you doing here?', at one point Sheriff Evans triumphantly states that we are in the twentieth century and that the ancient Native American demons are meaningless, even though we are actually in the twenty-first century , there is a part when a woman tells in flashback the story in which three men awaken the bone eater and kills them but since he killed all three how did he let someone else know that he was handed down in legend? sometimes it gets more than a little awkward. The characters are horrible clich√©s, the sheriff of the small town who saves the day, his daughter gets involved and adds a personal motivation and for the Native Americans there is an old sage, a hot young head who hates the white man and a young woman woman who is the voice of reason between the two who have names like Storm Cloud and Black Hawk. The film is boring to death, nothing happens, the story is horrible, it is full of holes and plot interruptions in every kind of logic, the set-sets are terrible, there is no horror or gore or suspense or mystery and Bone Eater is just the kind of movie that makes you lose the will to live. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater has some of the worst computer CGI effects I've seen in a while, from the stupid bone-eating creature in motion that is just a selection of bones magically held together with a bike that jumps a big gap to a terrible CGI truck that crashes on the edge of a cliff to a van that is thrown to one side by the bone-eater. Whenever the bone eater needs to accelerate, he makes a large horse form from the sand and dust and rides it! In principle this is a pretty nice idea, but it looks horrible and the scenes even have cowboy music on the soundtrack! There is a useless scene at the end when Sheriff Evans cuts his own arm (why?) And he bleeds, but apart from that there is not a single drop of blood in the thing, every time the bone eater kills someone which usually disappears only in a dull cloud of dust. The hilarious and resounding clash between Sheriff Evans and the bone-eater must be seen to be believed, Sheriff Evans goes riding on his face complete with tribal war paint on his face while the bone eater also rides his horse of dust and they have a kind of contest that is just a bad way to describe correctly. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of around $ 700,000, Bone Eater is filmed in a very bland, forgettable and flat way, there is absolutely no sense of style. Most of the film takes place under the sunlight and if you look at it on a discreet telly, the desert scenery is pretty nice on certain occasions. There are many veteran "well-known" actors who are really doing it, Boxleitner plays exactly the same role as Snakehead Terror (2004), very similar to "Creature Feature", William Katt obviously will put his name into crap until he is paid while the former Star Trek man, Walter Koenig, must be really desperate to agree to appear in this. <br /> <br /> Bone Eater is a truly atrocious 'Creature Feature', there's really not much else to say about it other than to steer well. The worst movie that ever appeared on the Sci-Fi channel and is saying something, right?
