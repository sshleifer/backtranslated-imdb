I have no idea who these others are, but this movie is just awful. They must support Joe Pesci when he is a secondary character. Exit and change films just like the studios did with Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey, etc. The DVD I saw states "this dark gem revolves around the MOB character of JOe Pesci which is a hot head that starts a war" etc. Etc. Joe plays the part of Joe, he doesn't even carry a gun, he plays a whining character and gets SPOILER - (hit). So much for the film that revolves around Pisces. The only memorable scene in the middle was a bad comedy attempt when they passed the gas waiting for a score. If you watch this movie after reading this, I warn you. Please stop and don't lose 87 minutes of your life.
