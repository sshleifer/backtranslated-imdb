it seems that if you publish here it will be a 10-star rating, no one ever seems to like nothing, well, I'm honest, some don't like it, but here we go, rachel ray show is just awful. !!!!!!, this show reminds me of the character snl linda anything if she had a cooking show -anything. I have to say that I liked rachel on the food web for $ 35- $ 40 a day, but I'm sorry she didn't have enough life experience to make it interesting day after day, give me a ham on the street, anthony bourdain, interesting people, but above all I find it annoying, in reality he told a member of the public in the studio to "shut up" yes joking but shut up and whoever cares about his pet stories, sorry Rachel you have been canceled !!!!
