Adding only to the chorus of people who considered this "unrecoverable", I will state the following without repeating the obvious FLAWS clearly stated by some of the other commentators: The "film" is shot on video (what kind of camera do I use? I know) but the cameraman put him on AUTOFOCUS (!) all the time, so that any slight movement makes him go in and out of focus. In many of the scenes the actors themselves go out of focus for their scenes. This just screams "Amateur". I also noticed that in the middle of the cornfield, you can hear the sound of the gasoline generator feeding the lights ... aloud. /> <br /> Also what is with that single source of illumination that follows (and many times "guides" the actors) when they turn. He looks like a journalist with that "camera light" that follows people around like a spotlight. There was no "credit" for lighting design / DP and I know why. The "directors" did not see the need to have someone who really knew what they were doing by illuminating this image (note that I did not say "film"). So get ready for a dazzling SINGLE spotlight as the sole source of "cinema lighting" for most of the film. UGhhh !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably the most technically inept production I've ever seen on the market. I "bought" this title because I like bad cinema. It's usually so bad you can laugh about it. This is so serious that it is unwatchable. Plan Nine from Outer Space is "Citizen Kane" in comparison to this title.
