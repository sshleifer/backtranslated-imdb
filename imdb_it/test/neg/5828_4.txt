All in all, this is a film for children. We saw it tonight and my son loved it. At one point my son's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible. However, I am a big fan of A.A. Milne's books are very subtle and hide an ironic intelligence behind the childlike quality of his main characters. This film was not thin. It seems shameful that Disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more than the stories on those pages, even though it may not have permission to use them. I found myself wishing that the theater would reproduce "Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger" instead. The characters' voices were very good. I was really annoyed by Kanga. The music, however, was twice as noisy in parts of the dialogue, and incongruous with respect to the film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a bit verbose and militant in tone. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go back just to see the same excitement on my daughter's face. <br /> <br /> I liked Lumpy's laughter ...
