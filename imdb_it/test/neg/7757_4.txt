From what I understand, Mr. Bava has abandoned this project before completion ... AND RIGHT SO !!! If I were him, surely I would have made sure that EVERY copy was burned and if someone in the future had ever asked me about this movie ... IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED AND HAS NEVER EXISTED ... end of story. <br /> <br /> Despite some fantastic sets and good photography this is a horrible movie ... should it be scary? (not least) should it be fun ?? (puh-leese) A total waste of time ... and I really don't like having to say it !!
