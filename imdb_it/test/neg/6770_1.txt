I took a screening of this at the True / False Documentary film festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was pretty disappointed. I was expecting an interesting documentary about the protest and activism surrounding the RNC, but what I got was a badly intricate, misinterpreted, fictional and conspiracy story. I had heard of his neo-documentary technique, "mixing both True and False", but I expected more along the lines of a fictitious plot developed for better personification and to create a sense of unity among real interviews, but it was longer than the lines of a terrible film for the TV conspiracy theory. <br /> <br /> The acting is terrible except for Rossario, which is not surprising considering that the director at the screening said that most of the protagonists had no acting training, his excuse is that he wanted them to be real . Here's a suggestion, real people can't act, but actors can usually behave in a real way. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't have been so grossly offensive if it wasn't obvious about how much he was willing to push this extremely conspiracy theory on us during the entire movie, it's particularly hysterical when we get a scene in where the director's cameos begin to prattle on ridiculously stupid theories and secret programs. The film also does an excellent job of ridiculous stereotype of every single role, tries so much to romanticize these street activists and to stamp a great "Good" or "Evil" on each character. <br /> <br /> Jump, maybe find yourself a nice real documentary /
