I understand that the budget was low for this film, but come on, it's really a terrible movie. The script is simply horrible and that was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this film looks like a movie with an R-rated with frightening fears and cutting violence rather than an unpicked celebration with no holds barred that was intentionally made for the video. Who were these kids kidding? How this would be released in theaters. <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible. The editing, another free aspect of the film, goes beyond the amateur and the plot, as I said before, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original about the film. Fan of Gore, avoid this. To the directors: try something original next time, or stop making films all together. You are not good at this. People hate a poor rihash, especially one of such low caliber. TO AVOID! It's not even worth teasing.
