Man with the Screaming Brain is a story of greed, betrayal and revenge in a small Bulgarian city. William Cole, a rich industrialist, ends up with a part of his brain replaced by that of a Russian taxi driver, Yegor. The two could not be more different, but they share one thing: both were killed by the same woman. Bringed back to life by a mad scientist, William and Yegor form an unlikely partnership to track down their common nemesis. <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell returns to the horror film genre B that gave him his cult status, this time not only in front of the screen, but behind the lens. Unfortunately for this time, the laughter does not give and Campbell has to resort to what he does best to try to fill the gap in this film. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Campbell, who has the movies, books and action figures, I was hoping for another success to add to my collection. Although, after seeing this movie before buying, I'm glad I didn't have the "pleasure" of adding it. <br /> <br /> The film does not go first in history, which at first glance seems like harmless fun, but it turns out to be boring designed dribble. It's a sad thing to say because it was written by Mr. Campbell himself. Comedy never strikes, it just makes our head scratch. It seems that Campbell has exhausted the things that are fun and has led to giving the public what we have already seen ... fighting himself. <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi, the brother of Evil Dead director Sam Raimi, is without doubt the highlight of the film. It brings a freshness and a fun moment when the film really needs it. Help if you are a fan and you are following these minions from Evil Dead to Xena, which is why I felt compelled to appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> Campbell's experience as a director, from directing to TV episodes, the Hercules series is obvious. Campbell makes the movie work quite well, even with the low budget. In the end, there are not so many things that one hopes for, but Campbell fans will be behind it, no matter what, unfortunately for this fan ... I won't.
