Adenoide Hynkel, a humble soldier of the first world war, rises again in the following years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. Create an aggressive and anti-Semitic war machine and grow a toothbrush mustache. Does it look like someone you know? <br /> <br /> From Hollywood security, Chaplin uses this soapbox to urge Europe to take up arms and challenge Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States had more than a year of neutrality before it in 1940, and no strong desire to engage in the European civil war (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the United States, not the other way around) it is surprising that Chaplin had the allowed to distribute this immoderate controversy. <br /> <br /> The story involves on the one hand the vulgar and repulsive Hynkel and the reign of terror on which he sits so inept, and life in the Jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, human, courageous, etc. etc. Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The tramp in all but the name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, interprets, composes music and does catering. <br /> <br /> In 1940 nothing was known of the Third Reich yet, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight, but also for the standards of the day when Hitler is mistaken. Comic and sentimental, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel foolish and unlucky. All it does is humanize it. When Hynkel, the not very warrior soldier, has fun with the big cannon and the upside-down airplane, it becomes captivating and not deplorable. As a dictator, he inspects the technical innovations of his subordinates who do not work (the parachute hat, the bullet-proof uniform, etc.) and these steps are meant to make us think that the Nazis of real life are incompetent and can be wiped out. In fact, the Hynkel regime is made nice and cute by its body spell. <br /> <br /> Actually, Chaplin's day had already passed when he made this reckless controversy. After all, it was still a mute screen dinosaur (check the humor, with gags like staggering up and down the semi-conscious way, or the pantomime of coins in puddings). The hero Schultz intends to represent a yardstick of European decency against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz seems more like an operetta character than a Nazi. Is it in any way credible that a figure of Schultz (if she had existed) would have said to the FÃ¼hrer's face: "your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid and ruthless persecution of innocent people"? And what is the name of Schultz in the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If it is the subject of an exhaustive manhunt, why does he continue to wear his Ruritan uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp that he offers us is hopelessly out of place with the gloomy spirit of the time. As usual, Chaplin thinks in terms of "silent" comic scripts, vaguely imprisoned on the narrative clothes line. There is the knockabout that demolishes stormtroopers, shaving a man with Brahms' accompaniment, and the ballet of the globe (see the segment turned upside down). Paulette Goddard is the perfect Hannah. Just as the people of the ghetto are incredibly beautiful, and the Jewish paradise of Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, so Hannah is literally too beautiful to be true. Brave, rebellious, resourceful, hard-working and (obviously) beautiful, he is the canary of Judaism in the ghetto cage. "Damn, am I not cute?" he asks, after the barber has done her a review. Too cute by far, is the answer. It doesn't come close to the real sound, because Chaplin made it a caricature. "Wouldn't it be wonderful?" the discourse Chaplin puts in his mouth is typical of the author - too verbose, too emotionally cloying. <br /> <br /> Jack Oakie is as big as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of Bacteria. He brings to the stage a much-needed whiff of comic vivacity, but the underlying weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is foolish and ineffective, how can we fear it? And anyway, the stop-start babbling of the rear-projected train is a fine Chaplinian example of a gag that extends far beyond its comic value. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish barber acquire that immaculate uniform Hynkel?
