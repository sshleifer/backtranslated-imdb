I saw him as a child, before he was torn by rotation, and even then he left a bitter taste in my mouth. There were some gags with skill, but making the slapstick criminals of American citizens who had been interned in the camps strictly because of their race was incredibly insipid. <br /> <br /> The same Moe would have liked this to be buried. He was a liberal boy. In his autobiography he told of visiting a city in the segregated South, where he saw a black man get off the sidewalk to avoid passing too close. Moe entered the street to prove that it wasn't a problem, and the man returned to the sidewalk. So off again. Eventually, the man told Moe nervously that if Moe had not stopped trying to share the sidewalk with him, he could have made them both lynched. Another thing: there are ostrich eggs that explode but no oxen in the film, so the title should be (if anyone cares) "The Yolk's on Me".
