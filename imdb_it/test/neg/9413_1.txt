I'm usually a big fan of Pacino (Scarface, Serpico, Devils advocate) but since a woman's perfume has pretty much the same role and screams a lot. This film had no endearing characters to keep warm. Brandon played by Bongo McConnahey is the least sympathetic of the group. He nowhere near even a real human being. Was Pacino hopelessly unpredictable and how old is Renee Russo? The only high light in this miserable mess was the prostitute with perfect lipstick and has 10 lines in total. Even the usual reliable Jeremy Piven was completely unlikely. <br /> <br /> Note to film writers, they usually don't work unless one of the main characters is at least a little sympathetic (notable Scarface exception). While the movie closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was, please, let a plane crash at the airport and kill Brandon.
