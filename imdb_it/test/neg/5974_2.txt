I'm sorry to say, but this is actually one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Thanks to his name "Darwin's Nightmare" I was expecting a documentary on the problems related to the Nile perch in Lake Victoria. <br /> <br /> What I saw in this "documentary" is an accumulation of individual stories, most of which are unrelated to either the fish or the lake. And most stories cannot be defined - it is more like some accumulated scenes that don't have a meaningful connection ... <br /> <br /> Because this movie is running out of time: - Show us not relevant information about the families of Russian pilots (some minutes are wasted for example in their private digital photos of wives and daughters) - In mourning the death of an African child who was bitten by a crocodile (as if this could not happen without the Nile perch) - Showing us about 100 times of how planes land and depart at the airport - Show us strange religious events for several minutes - Discussing in detail the life and death of a whore at the airport - Speaking with the children of their mothers, fathers - what works and / or how they died (well, guess what: some died from HIV - who would have imagined it?) These are just a few examples, I could go on for several pages ... <br /> <br /> This film is absolute blurry, and does not know at all what the ER view means. If you've never heard of Africa and you have no idea that this continent has problems with Social / Health / HIV / Violence / War, then this movie might be right for you. If you haven't closed your eyes in the last few decades, 90% of what this movie shows won't be new to you - and the way it is presented here will do its best to make you fall asleep. <br /> <br /> Maybe my expectations on this film were high, but I didn't like it, even if this is an interesting topic. If this film wants to show how poverty is linked to the Nile perch, perhaps he should have spent some time discussing that matter ...
