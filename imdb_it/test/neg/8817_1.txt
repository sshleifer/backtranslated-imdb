(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the film, but it can change the expectations of the film and thus make the experience less enjoyable.) <br /> <br /> Have you ever rented a film of fear, expecting to be on the edge of your place in fear, and instead ended up screaming in laughter at every stupid turn of the plot? This film has had so many opportunities to impress and scare the viewer. He was badly cut and skipped too much; referring to the past seems more like an excuse as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction. The writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot could have been performed, because the poor construction of the time along the plot is discouraging to the viewer and makes the film more and more tiring to watch. <br /> <br /> Almost Worse than the writers abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that little by little it relied on economic tactics for a scare. The acting didn't make it disturbing, and the situations weren't almost scary, so they needed some dark scenes with things that jumped on you to make it useful. Even those were predictable. <br /> <br /> Even the blood could not have saved the plot, and rivals the blood of the famous thriller Se7en. <br /> <br /> Speaking of Se7en, I feel like Saw has tried to follow the incredibly fascinating psychological theme of Se7en, but has failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed by the lack of analysis and the structure of the plot surrounding the murderer's psychology. The start scenes make fun of the viewer in thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it's far from that. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention poor acting? At the beginning, Cary Elwes seems to make a convincing performance; however, this completely deteriorates in the most crucial parts of the plot. I was left in tears to laugh at this performance, which is worthy of a Razzie. The Leigh Whannell performance is also terrible and too played, though not as bad as Elwes's performance, and the big red flag with this is that Whannell is also a writer for the film. <br /> <br /> The end of Saw could never compensate for having lost the entire center, and this is what makes it a huge failure. It was a missed opportunity, and I have no idea why Monica Potter and Danny Glover chose to play this movie. <br /> <br /> I am angry with myself for wasting money for just renting it. Certainly not worth the $ 4, and in the future I will definitely avoid seeing anything to do with Elwes, Whannell or James Wan. The great tragedy in this is not that it lacked the basis for its plot, it is that the great potential plot was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury. I will avoid the poor word games that affect the title and end with this: don't watch this movie.
