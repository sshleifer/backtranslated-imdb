Some movies are just ?? bad lucky. These are the films that obviously have thrived with a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but they simply didn't have the budgetary means and / or members of the professional cast and crew available to make it happen. "The Strangeness" certainly belongs to this category. You would really like it, but even the most tolerant and less demanding horror fanatics of the 1980s will have to admit that the film barely reaches the level of mediocrity due to its atmosphere of convenience, awkward stop-motion effects and impenetrably dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a fairly original plot and setting (ok, it's similar to "The Boogens" but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman intentionally snatched another insignificant 80's B-movie) and that players offer enthusiastic performances although they are all mixed. An assembly of amateur speleologists embarks on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners have mysteriously died there and the place has abandoned since then, but there should be too much gold hidden there to stay closed forever. Shortly after descending into the mine, the members of the group one by one meet the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly poor way of moving forward. During most of its running time, "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting. The characters are not interesting and mine remains a mystery because the only light effects come from the speleologists' helmets. There is little action or horror to experience in the first hour, but director Hillman cleverly grabs the attention of viewers by showing pieces and pieces of the monster at regular intervals. As soon as you see the monster's tentacle, you are destined to continue looking until the end. The creature is made with stop-motion effects, which I usually love and adore, but here in this case they seem extremely weak and pitiful. The person in charge of the special effects should have paid more attention to the work of Ray Harryhousen. Death sequences occur largely off screen and there is little suspense throughout the film. A horror film with such a setting should benefit from the claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" lacks this. The film's biggest trump is undoubtedly the beautiful appearance of blonde actress Terri Berland. It looks like a speleologist as much as I look like Mother Teresa, but it certainly looks good with its tight white top and beige pants.
