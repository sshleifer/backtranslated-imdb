I'm usually a Bruce Willis fan, and although he played the cold-hearted professional killer, I thought he was the most attractive character here. Having said that, his character makes such a mess of his professional activity, it's incredible that he hasn't been caught before. The plot is so thin that it is meaningless. The end was no less annoying and offensive due to the fact that it could have been foreseen for about 20 minutes in the film. <br /> <br /> ** spoilers follow ** In Hollywood morality, good guys always win, with some victims along the way, and the bad guys die, or at least are heading for justice at the end. The breathtaking insult of the film is the way our IRA terrorist, who somehow became a tender and touchy character, comes to a new life. How does his former terrorist playmate (who is now a loving wife and mother). <br /> <br /> Who is the biggest villain? The first (and, as far as we can say, unrepentant) terrorist or hired assassin? I don't see much to choose between them --- in real life, or in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is the poorest film I've seen this year.
