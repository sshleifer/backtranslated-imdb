<br /> <br /> I thought this film lacked the dramatic suspense of the first film. This is difficult to achieve when the film takes place over a week. The original film led to the final climate scene for a period of one year and was still less violent than the sequel. A good thing about this film is that the film went relatively fast, because the plot seemed rushed. When Rachel's best friend died, there were no funerals mentioned in the film. Another downfall was the involvement of Amy Irving. All his scenes slowed the pace of the film. The dialogue in this film was terrible. In no way does it reflect the way children talk. In conclusion, this film could have been a success, but it collapsed after the opening scene.
