This was the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. It is a total waste of time and money. I went to see this movie with my friends and when the movie was finished not a single person in the cinema - not that there was a lot of people there to see this terrible movie - he said "wow, what a great film". Someone actually came out! It was absolutely terrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute. My friend was putting her head in my shoulder towards the end because after the scene with Rick on the pee ceiling, she had had enough. It wasn't funny at all. Believe me I went with 11 other girls and none of my friends liked me. It was ridiculous! I have seen many movies but this was absolutely the worst! I mean, a scene from the movie is with an old man making out with a dead person in a coffin. I can't invent these things.
