I saw it on French TV today and I was very disappointed! The film starts quite well, but nothing is clarified and in the end we are no longer ahead of the beginning. As for seeing her husband for the murder of his wife, this is not plausible. You need tangible evidence to convict someone and a minimum of evidence. In this case there is none at all, so it is not plausible. Remember the old adage "innocent until proven guilty". The fact that a woman has disappeared without a trace is not proof that her husband killed her. So I really don't know what kind of argument this movie is trying to make. The result is totally illogical and incomprehensible, no incriminating evidence is revealed to the viewer. So frankly, vision is a complete waste of time. After all, a movie must be fun ... this is completely untrue in the case of this and I suggest being irrevocably delivered to the trash to which it belongs!
