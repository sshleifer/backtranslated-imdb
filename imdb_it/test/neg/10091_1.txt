Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man the day before I saw Duces Wild, but I don't think there could be an excuse for the fact that this movie is as bad as before. The cast was there to do it, but it seemed that once they found themselves with a decent cast they had to try to get them into the movie. The only problem was that they didn't go well. I did not like any of the characters and the story was somewhat inaccurate. I left to wonder why I spent my money on this movie.
