Voor een verloren soldaat, for a lost soldier, is a sad example of how not to translate to film a moving and complex psychological study of that most magical moment in a man's life, when he is still a child, but he begins to become a man . The novel records the real life experiences of Rudy van Dantzig, told through the boy Jeroen, during the waning days of the Second World War at the age of 11, while dealing with his incipient sexuality, and his deep fears of abandonment when he was sent to the province of Friesland, north of Holland by his parents because of the lack of food in Amsterdam and he hasn't heard of it for many months when the postal service collapsed. The arrival of liberating soldiers in the film is presented in a painfully rude manner, with soldiers offering vaudeville style of entertainment. Then a soldier, Walt, teases Jeroen and the couple is presented as two loving males. Who consume their love in a sexual experience. This teased from the age of 11, Jeroen. The reality was a bit different: Jeroen describes his encounters with Walt, 6 in all, in detail but in oblique language. But there is no misunderstanding in their nature. Walt is aroused by an intense passion of Jeroen, during which he brutally treats him, so that in their last meeting, Jeroen is injured and suffers from a painful wound on his shoulder where Walt bit him. During this meeting, Walt rapes Jeroen, twice. Jeroen could have easily avoided Walt after their second fight, when Walt first attacked him while Walt was clearly anxious to keep his boyfriend abuse from the other soldiers. Because Jeroen continues to search for Walt out is a mystery of the human heart and unexplainable, by me anyway. What the film leaves out are the consequences: the nightmares, the discomfort, the frantic search all over Amsterdam on the possibility of finding Walt, because Jeroen loved Walt and nothing could shake him.
