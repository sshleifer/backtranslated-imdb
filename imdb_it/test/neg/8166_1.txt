Well, I just caught the tail of this movie on HBO, only in the last 10 minutes or so, but I have to say that it probably contains the most ridiculous description of the distance that EVER runs on film! I am a serious distance runner and a passionate fan of the sport, and I sat through many painful demonstrations in the previous films. However, nothing could ever prepare me for what is shown on the screen in the last 10 minutes of this film, literally challenging beliefs! The depiction of the riders is even more ironic considering that the African riders completely dominate the sport, and they are elegant and graceful. The female protagonist drags herself like an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly qualified" male supporters are no better. Well in the race this supposed world class runner is surrounded by plump and overweight people, many of whom are WALKING! I find it interesting that the director has decided to let her lead the women's competition, yet towards the end she is shown passing people who seem to stagger on two broken legs! Should we believe that this extraordinary stellar athlete has overtaken a paralyzed person at the end of the race? Perhaps the director thinks that the runners can't run faster than 12 minutes, and obviously he never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a fan you will be amazed by the insanely inaccurate portrait of the race, and this film can only be viewed as an involuntary comedy. Here is a note for the director: the next time you decide to make a film about a sport, it might be worth hiring at least one person who actually watched the sport in action.
