I was Stan in the movie "Dreams Come True". Stan was the friend who worked in the factory with the main character and ended up having his arm broken in the car and was carried out screaming (where was the ambulance?) The acting in this film was for the most part rather poor with mostly local actors from Fox Valley, Wisconsin. I saw the movie on the big screen. He played 2 nights in 3 theaters and it was something special to watch on the big screen. I could be a prejudice, but overall, I liked it. The soundtrack was also the Spooner band, which later became Garbage. My brother Steve Charlton was also in the film. He played Swenson the man who arrives at the door with crutches to talk to the police.
