How is it in this day and era, are people still stupid enough to think that other stupid things are smart? Maybe stupid people love to look at things that make them feel smart. For example "War at home". 'Cuss is even more stupid than the stupid people who look at him. There are no jokes, just jokes and jokes that barely even ensure a small inner smile. Acting is the typical flailing-limb-like acting typical, vapid, idiotic, standard. And why oh, why did this crap replace the arrested development? Well, you have to deliver it to Fox. They know they need stupid shows to attract all the stupid spectators. You see, the reason the arrested development wasn't very popular was because he was so smart. He was so smart that it made stupid people to be so stupid to look stupid. And, of course, if a stupid person meets an intelligent person, the stupid person will hate the intelligent person. Most of the time, however. Or that, or try to turn off the smart person. If you like this show, and you are one of the stupid people, I can't really understand how it should be if you don't have your eyes open and your minds open. I can't understand what it must be like to be brainless, to laugh at drones, influenced by every little thing. Basically, people who laugh with laughter are parrots. Parrots trained, obedient, mindless. Maybe I shouldn't insult the parrots by comparing them with you. You know who you are. (If I look like a bastard * in this review, it's because I'm so annoyed that AD is canceled).
