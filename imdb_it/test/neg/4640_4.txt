Another day: this film requires you to watch it another day to understand it. I really enjoy seeing Shannen Doherty and I was very interesting to see how Julian McMahon and Shannen appeared together following the roles they played in Charmed. I can certainly LODE the acting skills for the whole film, even the direction - but the plot ... what happened? I'm at a loss for words because I'm still confused. I have to stay true to the actors who did a really good job considering the madness of the plot. I must also advise you to watch it because, despite the madness of the plot, I would look at it again and again.
