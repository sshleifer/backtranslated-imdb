The production value of AvP2 can be described by an adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, even in the fictitious area of ​​AvP: what are the facehuggers suitable for the Predator's ship? Why is the Predator cleansing all the signs of his influence and wasting precious time with eviscerating and even presenting the body of an insignificant human policeman? Why only the Predator? Why is the Predator gearing up only on earth but on its home planet? Why does the Predator make his job so uncomfortable on his own by hunting down Aliens rather than bombing the entire countryside like humans do in the end? Because the Predator always drops more than its few weapons instead of collecting them to keep them together after having one. In the end he even got rid of his armor before fighting the Predalien in close combat: that bad plagiarism of the first predators ends with the struggle between Arny and the Predator. The Predator's gestures are so exaggerated that he moves more like a Japanese sumo than a highly specialized extraterrestrial hunter. As you can see immediately the whole story is a mess. But it gets even worse because this failed job is full of boring patchwork of senseless interludes like a long episode of pizza ordering or some detailed information on the two brothers' criminal past (Dallas and Ricky). The sheriff is obviously the friend of these two criminals he regularly puts behind bars. (not convincing and absolutely superfluous for the plot). <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the cast of the actors is horrible. Compared to the upper class of directors and actors in the former Aliens or Predator films, AvP2 is a piece of embarrassing shit. <br /> <br /> Finally the action of the film is really poor. There is no single fighting action scene in which the audience can see the entire set. Each battle is filmed in short, trembling bursts with close-up zoom to almost complete darkness. This results in an atrocious experience for the public because most of the time you see nothing but a dark screen. <br /> <br /> I suggest the two brothers Strause directors to buy a steadycam and get a lesson in the modern CG so that the next film contains some visible actions of visible figures and may not need to mask their bad capacities of directing in this way. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone (even die AvP fans) to watch this movie: I prefer the first or the original Aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid disappointing yourself by wasting your precious time in this failure .
