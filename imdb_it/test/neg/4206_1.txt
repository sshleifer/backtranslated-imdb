Ok with this film there are a number of ingredients at work: <br /> <br /> First, put in a lot of hillbilly truckers - good ole guys who have the secret desire to take the law into their own hands. The second put in bad hill cops controlled by an outlaw raised in Texas. Third place in the karate fighting truck driver played by Chuck Norris. Fourth put into a teenager chump like Norris's nephew captured by evil police officers. The fifth show Chuck Norris fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now mix everything together and what do you have? <br /> <br /> You guessed it ... a mediocre movie!
