Spoilers ahead JEEEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicids kill idiots ..." The "ghost" in this film kills morons. Many of the people who are killed in this film, in fact, ASK to be killed, running in abandoned houses, chasing ghosts, etc. ... <br /> <br /> On a strictly cinematic aspect, this film sucks. The three narrative lines are shown as parallel and suddenly, we learn that they have been separated for at least a few days. It's an economic blow ... <br /> <br /> Also, the "chills" are so cheap, they're ridiculous. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" hasn't diminished so much to show that someone is being attacked by their sweater ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save your money, stay home and you won't have a grudge against the directors
