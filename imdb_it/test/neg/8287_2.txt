A high school star falls dead after winning a race; a little later, his older sister (Patch Mackenzie) returns home in time to notice that all of his sister's athletic team members are disappearing. Who could be the killer? Maybe you don't care enough to find out. <br /> <br /> Raw, cheap and amateur slasher is practically useless, even if Christopher George (the bad track trainer) tries to give him a ride with an intense performance. Not even the blood is noteworthy. Everything is lame from beginning to end, starting with the opening of the film on an assembly track mounted on disco music, and the casting of E.J. Peaker, once co-star of the movie "Hello, Dolly" as a character called "Blondie"! Exactly, "Blondie". This could mean that we should not take the film seriously, but in any case it is a mess. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of routine slasher stuff that makes "Friday 13" movies look like art in comparison. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest could be to want to see a cinematographic appearance of Vanna White, of all people. <br /> <br /> 2/10
