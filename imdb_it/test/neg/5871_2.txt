This is one of those movies that you find when you get up too late and only have a basic cable. It is hard to believe that this film was made in 1995, considering that it seems to have come out of the late 1980s. The young people full of home problems collide with a crazy ice cream that is on a mission to make the best flavor ever: Soylent Cream !!! <br /> <br /> This film is extremely demented and is just scary how disturbing and absolutely ridiculously coarse. In reality, the really scary thing about this film is the nature of the problems that these children face at home. The fact that these guys have no escape from their silent suburban sufferings makes an ordinary fool look like a walk in the park. <br /> <br /> The most laughable part of this film is the fact that the stereotype "fat kid" is obviously a pre-teen slim with a mountain of padding under its wide sweatshirts. I imagine that a) they had not invented / could not afford a complete fat, b) the casting director was too lazy to find a plump baby or c) honestly we should believe that this baby is hungry and has a hugely relaxed belly. <br /> <br /> So, if you are at 2 in the morning and you need something ridiculous and disgusting to snatch from your friends intoxicated, go ahead and take a look. Personally, I'd rather sleep.
