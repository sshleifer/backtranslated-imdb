A traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) stumbles into the city of Gatlin, where children have slaughtered adults and are always anxious to slaughter more, along their way to separate and Peter Horton, of course, must save his wife from these tiring terrible tykes in this bad adaptation of one of the best stories of the king. In the original story King has managed to create tension and attract the personality of his characters, however all this has been removed from production and all that remains is a boring nuisance that is too predictable to be all so suspenseful. Even the effective ending used in the story is in favor downloaded for a happy ending that makes the overall impact silent. There is a bit of atmosphere and an elegant direction, but there is no plot to support them. Even the children are not convincing. <br /> <br /> 1/5 Matt Bronson
