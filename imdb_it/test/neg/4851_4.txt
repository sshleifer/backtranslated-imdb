I don't see what the complete agreement on this film is. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the film fascinating, but singing is not enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits of this, go buy the Patricia CD and have fun! The plot is simple (if you omit the "dreams"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly and can even instantly forget their other knowledge. The reports seem almost "obligatory", and the little "detective novel" staged makes things worse. What at first seemed to be a perfect film, is first screwed and then comes out like a dream. I measure the films as I would like to remember them, and for this I have already begun to forget the details.
