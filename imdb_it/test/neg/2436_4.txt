This film is presented as an English version of an ABC after special school, with nudity. It makes you wonder who the target audience should be. It's not as if the writers were too worried about selling a plausible plot. Even if it has a certain brightness, Virtual Sexuality is softer than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie to watch if you've snowed, the cable is out, and it's the only tape you have.
