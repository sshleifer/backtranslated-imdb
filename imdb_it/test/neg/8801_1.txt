I don't understand how some people can stand to play "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooter games available. <br /> <br /> "Counter-Strike" is a game that does not use imaginative ideas in its weapons. All the weapons in the game are real weapons, but there may have been at least one trick that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, like the all-powerful BFG in Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player must actually reload the weapon manually. This can become extremely annoying, especially while you're in the middle of a firefight when you're so close to killing the enemy. The charging delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow in performing its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are 4 types of characters each for the terrorist and anti-terrorist forces. This means that many characters look the same to each other, which makes the game really realistic. <br /> <br /> The game is rather sexist when it comes to selecting characters. In the first version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in the selection of terrorist forces) that was good for female players. In the latest versions, however, the female character has been deleted and replaced with another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed by the new versions. <br /> <br /> Finally, the maps of the game are very small. The larger map appears to be the desert map, but has standard details. In fact, all the maps of the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most unimaginable first person shooting game of all time. There are many better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? You'd better play the Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom tournaments. Avoid this over-rated and over-hyped game. <br /> <br /> I give the game at 1/10.
