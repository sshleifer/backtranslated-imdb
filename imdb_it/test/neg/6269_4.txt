It's amazing that there were two films with the same story released in 2005. This one came out one day earlier with the other with Tom Cruise. Didn't they do it with Truman Capote the same year, and the Zodiac killer last year? Interesting. <br /> <br /> Writer / director David Michael Latt did not have the budget of Steven Spielberg and C. Thomas Howell is not Tom Cruise. This is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed $ 588 million worldwide. <br /> <br /> The action was minimal and most of the time we were treated by the whining of Rhett Giles, who played a shepherd who was giving up his god. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey was terrifying as an LT army.
