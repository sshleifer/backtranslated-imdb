1989 was already a year when Eddie Murphy was no longer warm and started making films that would soon be forgotten. Strangely, it was also the year that Murphy directed his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. The "Harlem nights" weren't exactly what can be called a success, although it was nice to see the two best black comedians together, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don't blame the actors since they all played their roles as you expected, even if you had to face (again) Murphy's typical laugh. The worst thing about "The nights of Harlem" is both the scenery and its terrible decorations. Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everyone has their profit from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) are easily collecting $ 10,000 a day, but obviously the crowd and the corrupt police soon come around the corner to claim their share of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not kids who give their money for free and have their plans. You can watch "Harlem Nights" for sure, but if you vomit from the moment you hear the name Murphy it's best to avoid it because after all this movie is nothing but an inconvenient excuse to see some good jokes.
