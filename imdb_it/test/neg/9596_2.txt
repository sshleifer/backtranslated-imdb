Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people find themselves with a little money, a certain knowledge of cinema, a mixture of aspiring actors and a lot of determination, but all without the knowledge and skills necessary to bring out something more of a rather poor After School Special (in a negative sense, not in a nostalgic sense). I mean this is such a quality movie for the home movie / student film if you want to pass it on to family and friends for free. Fortunately, I found it in a discount container somewhere. Sure, there might be some sort of market out there for this kind of thing, but it's a market that seems to exist only by default because there are so many poor B movies out there. Even more now in this day and age. <br /> <br /> The only people I would recommend this move to are aspiring guerrilla directors. First of all, I would advise them to look at the special function MAKE OF THINGS INCLUDED ON THE DISC. Watch the enthusiasm of film crews, their hard work, joy and the very high opinions of their own product. THEN watch the movie. Hopefully within a few frames you will understand what went wrong. Bored, I dealt with it all and clearly the director and director of photography tried, but I don't know enough about what they are doing. They knew enough to have fun, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, this interprets: They knew enough to be dangerous. This is like a bad Nickelodeon movie (as I suppose for a more decent one, I guess). A couple of actors did well, and the cool stoner who looks like a guy with a tattoo (the real or fake tattoo I don't know) was probably the best and most natural and I hope he does. But their natural acting talent was what was happening despite the bad film, the bad script and the so directive principles. If the director had spent more time helping these aspiring actors develop their characters, successfully studying photographic techniques and lighting principles to better direct his crew, and if the script had actually been worked out rather than written in about a week (according to very indulgent documentary) then maybe this could have been more than a movie. Instead, it is a film that has a feeling of a certain potential, and has some moments in it (due more to the genre than to the film itself), but ends up showing almost every frame, WHAT NOT TO DO. If you want to see what a decent low-budget horror movie can look like, look at Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a glorified animated film (not a joke), look for Bog Creatures.
