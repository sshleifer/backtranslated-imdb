Unbelievable. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People must have seen another "Oldboy" because what I saw was a "Kraapola" poorly written, poorly conceived, exaggerated and sordid that even ignoring for a moment the ridiculously violent scenes that make it not suitable for a child , could hardly satisfy the imagination and thirst for coherence of seven years plot. <br /> <br /> The "depth" of this dirty concoction was exhausted in a small piece of wisdom "Laugh and the whole world will laugh with you, you cry and you'll find yourself alone", the kind of boring fortune cookie that he says that a great author, whether he is Shakespeare or, more to the point of IMDb, Kurosawa, would have thrown in the garbage can without second thoughts. This film should also be landed, if we did not live in an age where cheap nonsense and perversely disgusting are confused with what was once called "great art". In short, it sucks. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It is not 1 in 1000 only because of some occasionally experienced chamber work. In no way enough to save this childhood failure from worthlessness, though.
