It was inferred from a previous manifesto that the military would not be subjected to the police in a disaster as described in the film. In reality, the military role would be to provide aid to the civil authorities on request. The civil authorities would retain the primacy. In practice, the army would need about 48 hours to mobilize, as there is not much army presence in London, especially with current overseas commitments. Also in this case they would be dependent on the call in TA. <br /> <br /> As for COBRA, we were given the impression that it was a fully-fledged government emergency department - even a reference to a Metra Cobra Police Division. In fact COBRA is the acronym of Cabinet Office Briefing Room "A". It's just the room where the PM or DPM meet their consultants to discuss the current emergency!
