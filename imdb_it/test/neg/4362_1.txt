Both Killjoy 1 and Killjoy 2, but the former was better. The special effects in this film were not special at all. Although the killings were better in this episode, they were nothing to brag about. One thing that was worse in part 2 were the characters. Their emotions suddenly changed and some of their lines were simply stupid. For example, one character quoted, "It is better to have a R.E.S.P.E.C.T. or you will find out what it means to me." Once I heard that sentence, I thought it was the worst I'd ever heard. Another thing I hated about this movie was that it was too short. A successful film must last more than an hour and twenty minutes, like Killjoy 2. If Full Moon is part 3 of Killjoy, it would have dropped to the lowest possible level. Overall, 1 in 10. <br /> <br />
