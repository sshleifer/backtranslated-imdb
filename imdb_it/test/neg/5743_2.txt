This is a relatively watchable movie (+1). After seeing UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this looks good by comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffes, although vampire teeth seem strange. <br /> <br /> The plot makes no sense. Let's see. An American soldier fights vampires. He returns to the United States and is rehabilitated for having seen ... Vampires. His commanding officer is his ex-wife's aunt. Who happens to do some research on biodiversity in the South American area where vampires are. Eh! Don't accumulate too many coincidences. Who cares about the vampire boss? Or your daughter? Or someone in this movie? The only novelty in this is that most myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, that can't come out during the day, etc.) are wrong. But they cannot be killed except by beheading or a wooden wound in the heart. Yeah, for sure. It is obvious that they did not want to make a dark film, since this is a TV movie. <br /> <br /> It would have been nice for the viewer, if they had hired actors. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (TV Wonder Woman), and a big black guy with a tremendously deep voice, which growls appropriately to show his prosthetic teeth on vampire teeth. But otherwise, you would never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough combat scenes, and some vampire-biting blood, but no real violence.
