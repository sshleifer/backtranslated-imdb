I saw Grande Ecole in a world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival. I had no idea what I was getting into and if I had an idea I wouldn't have entered. This is the most pretentious film I've seen in a long time. He tries to be provocative, but profound, with his complete frontal homosexual sex scenes - he can't! It is nothing but another bad excuse to show naked people on the big screen. 4/10
