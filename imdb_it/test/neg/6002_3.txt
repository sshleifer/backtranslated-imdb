Predictable, bloody, deceptive, mediocre. Don't waste time: there are many much better movies out there. <br /> <br /> Resurrection starts OK but the plot quickly becomes repetitive. My level of interest has steadily decreased. At the end of the film I was glad it was finally over. The characters have never been completely developed. The cinematography is muddy and the rapid change of the POV rotations - even if impressive in 1999 perhaps, at the moment it simply serves to label the film as an attempt to replace gee whiz flash for the character's plot and substance. The filming gimmicks of the film have a purpose (they transmit tension and anxiety) but they are constantly abused and eventually they become counterproductive. A shame on the whole: the film / story obviously had potential and the producers / directors and actors obviously have technical skills. A delusion.
