Don't see "Mr. Magoo". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was no fun in it. It wasn't fun from the Naked Gun movies. Well, it won't take long to realize that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The plot of the film is ridiculously silly. Nothing in the whole film was fun. The first few minutes of the film were animated to resemble the old cartoons of Magoo. I wish the film would have remained like this.
