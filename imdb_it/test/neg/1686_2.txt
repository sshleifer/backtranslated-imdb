I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and I started showing replicas. Actually, I liked the first one for the third season. Once I saw the fourth and fifth I was starting to get irritated. The first problem was that they did that irrelevant scenario of the repeating story (Jr had a child like his parents). The second was to be one in which everyone had partnered with someone (eg Katie and Franklin). The third episode was when they made Jr even more idiotic than before, which was starting to get boring and irritating to the point where I wanted to get into the TV and beat stupidity outside of him until he was unconscious. The fourth was to be the zealous idiot Clarie claimed as her boyfriend. The fifth was to be Katie, she was starting to be too good for herself and was treated with her "boyfriend" Franklin as the push she was. The last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson just more annoying !!! They seriously missed the shark when he arrived at the show. There was little or no realism to his character and the way he laughed was an obvious sign of strength that showed that Noah could not act. Every time I saw that guy it made me want to slap him. However, B.F. (before Frank) this show was fun and very funny.
