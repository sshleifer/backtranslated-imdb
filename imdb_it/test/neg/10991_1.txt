Like the other comments, it could be a surprise for those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But you've seen Delicatessen before, there's nothing new about this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie came too late to be of any interest. I don't think it's a worse film than Delicatessen, but it's annoying to see it now, as if it were probably to watch Delicatessen again. There is really no sense in the film, nothing that really contains or remains with you. There may be a distant resemblance to Kusturica's films, but he's really in a different league, so you should go see his films rather than waste time with Tuvalu.
