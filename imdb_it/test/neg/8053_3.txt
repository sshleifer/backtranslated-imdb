The unexpected turn of the director Todd Verow in a sentimental coming out drama produces a predictable result: nothing new to see here. Interesting but unconvincing leads: should these twenties be in high school? - dribbling banalities about confused and adolescent sexuality does not seem to me the best way to explore the promise of Anonymous, who was equally involved in himself, but also honest, raw and, by comparison, not all that is rude. I have no idea what to do with this gray and uninteresting film except to hope that Verow finds another career. Sure, it's unpretentious, but so is Mike Huckabee. <br /> <br /> No single attribute, however, is as terrible as the electronic divide of Jim Dwyer, who scratches non-stop, from wall to wall throughout the length of this film. If I had seen this, and heard this, in a theater, I would have gone out. Fortunately, on my laptop, I could rub and hit the silent.
