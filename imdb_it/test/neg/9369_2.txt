I don't usually write reviews for shows unless I've seen them in full. However, there were so many positive opinions about this show here that I felt it was necessary to balance it with some realism. <br /> <br /> This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it was meant to be, but it is. I see that there is a lot of praise on the show, and I honestly can't understand why --- this show is so poorly interpreted, the dialogue is so terrible, and the plots are thin around their holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting as it is a clear litmus test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and maybe those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work, which makes the show almost unwatchable for people like me. <br /> <br /> If you have fun enjoying a show while watching it, anticipating the lines of the cliché and the like, this can be a fun show to ridicule, if you have that kind of time available. <br /> <br /> The pilot is an example rather than the whole show. If the cliché of meaningless spelling does not leave you in stupid astonishment, then this could be a show for you.
