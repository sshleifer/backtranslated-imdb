A total and total parody of a film. "The power of power" is the kind of film that even the troma would be embarrassed to release. The script, the direction, the acting and the action sequence are so terrible as to be almost painful to watch and I can't help thinking that only 75 minutes of duration could have been spent better. The reviewer mentioned above must be connected to the director as it is the only reason I can see for his evaluation of this junk, some might call it fun b-movie or 'so bad is good' just to excuse the enjoyment of it but when the main actor (and the most experienced cast member) fails to deliver his lines convincingly, you know you have a very, very bad movie. Avoid at all costs.
