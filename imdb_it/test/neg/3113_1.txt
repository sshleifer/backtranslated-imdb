I had to read I Know Why The Caged Birds Sing in my English class and we watched the movie after finishing it. After seeing the movie, I'm sorry to see it. It has completely removed the impact of the book. The scenes made no sense in their sequences, the acting was horrible, and it seemed that the writer had never actually taken the book but opted instead for the cliff notes. I was indignant about how the film ended. Almost half of the book has been cut and some aspects have been extremely important for the growth of Maya as a person. If you've read ... Birds in a cage, this movie will ruin the book experience, so I warn you not to see it.
