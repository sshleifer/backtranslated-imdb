I like films of various kinds and qualities. Whether it's the typical Hollywood action movie or your Oscar season, movies that meet certain standards will almost always be nice to me. <br /> <br /> In Soap Girl, I received nothing but confusion. First, we meet Maya, a masseuse who seems to attract all the customers in the living room. A virgin poet named Harry arrives in a day and fall in love. After that, there are various twists thrown into the plot that seem to lead nowhere. <br /> <br /> Although many have commented on the controversial problem of an Asian prostitute being exploited by the white man, keep in mind that this film was made by an Asian director who wanted to shed light on the issue. But whether it is successful or not, it doesn't matter, because the problem is whether the film is fun or not. <br /> <br /> For me, Soap Girl does not meet the standard I expect from movies. It was hard for me to emotionally involve this film, given the loose storyline and mediocre acting. Worse, it seems that the director wanted to do a drama, when the tone goes more towards comedy. <br /> <br /> A film like Soap Girl that can't trap me in the magic of cinema will always leave me bored. Throughout the film, I couldn't help thinking, "What is it really about?" A film must answer this question before it is made. Otherwise, what you will find is an empty push to attract public attention. <br /> <br /> Vote: D + <br /> <br />
