The only interesting part of this film was its fall in jazz and reggae in New Orleans. Try to be one of those films that has two struggles that the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present that fails to do convincingly. The acting is very bad and the direction is even worse. I'm not surprised this went directly to the video. The final result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced including the actors themselves.
