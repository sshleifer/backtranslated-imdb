Dead Man's Bounty (the American title of the film) looks like a classic Italian western. Cinematography, costumes and set designs are fantastic. The cast is robust, it's not a pretty face between them. At the beginning I was preparing for a good film, but what I finally saw was an absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The script was really terrible. There was no suspense whatsoever and very little useful action or drama. <br /> <br /> Despite the fantastic appearance, the cast spoke (English) with heavy European accents that were often unintelligible. <br /> <br /> The final Nail in his coffin was the wide strip of pretentiousness that paints most of the picture, focusing heavily on the character of the maid who was described in a couple of very embarrassing sex scenes. Even his speech towards the end was rather repulsive! <br /> <br /> The only novelty comes from Val Kilmer's acrobatic casting in the role of the dead, continuing his recent DOA! series of performances!
