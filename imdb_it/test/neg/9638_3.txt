This is one of those so-called "Hollywood Social Commentary" movies that want to have both cards in order. And believe me, in this film, both ways are clichés and stereotypes. STOP-LOSS is a 21st century John Wayne film that deals with an anti-war sentiment but which clearly ends with the note: "If you are a MAN in today's society, you put yourself on stage and go to war with yours friends". In many ways the film was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE as it played an equally crazy and out-of-control soldier, a whim almost FRAT PARTY / ANIMAL HOUSE mixed with a Texas Red Neck world of homo-erotic repressed evidence of masculinity. This film had everything in one scene after another of the cliché images. And then the rebel military deserter Ryan Phillippe does a "Road Trip" with his best friend's girlfriend, an artificial plot manipulation to visit dead military families, mutilated soldiers in military hospitals, etc. And finally to address the issue of flight to Canada or Mexico. But masculine honor and patriotism are won in the end, like all fresh and beautiful, it launches at sunset on a bus with its friends in Iraq and in a world that a few minutes before has assured everyone that it would never again tolerate . COMPLETE METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA. But in the end, John Wayne rides again! And a Hollywood Blockbuster eventually manages to keep both sides of his audience in the palm of his hand ????. At least he would like to think so. As for me, bring me back to the most convincing reality of IN THE GARDEN OF ELAH.
