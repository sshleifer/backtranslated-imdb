Well, that was definitely a waste of Dave McKean's talent, wasn't it? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphics, Dave McKean could be the best in the world right now. The layered and structured look that manages to achieve with just a few pencil lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher like what they are: hackwork. McKean was the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics, movies, even magazine ads that borrow the exclusive collage effect he has experienced. <br /> <br /> But this movie? It is rubbish. Complete garbage The story, by Neil Gaiman, is, unfortunately, exactly what Gaiman has given us since he first ripped off Clive Barker: a pseudo-mythical, exaggerated, exaggerated dream landscape populated by characters who have titles in All capital letters, rather than names. Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion or empathy from anyone involved. People make concise postulations, speaking in puzzles that suggest what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead might have looked like if Tom Stoppard had suffered a debilitating blow in the middle of his composition. Really, Gaiman, recover. You are not a prophet. You are a poser. <br /> <br /> McKean's direction does not help - his rhythm is poor, taking half an hour to devote himself to the picaresque plot, and then simply providing a disconnected sequence of events, none of them gave any weight. Monsters do not threaten because they are not foreshadowed, simply launched on the screen. The plot does not engage because we are not really interested in the small rancid protagonists. Half of the dialogues, muttered in the face of a shirt and omnipresent masks, are unintelligible. <br /> <br /> Some images are beautiful, and I'm sure the fans will be licking. Pity. Think of the amount of really good work McKean could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project. <br /> <br /> Rating: D / D-
