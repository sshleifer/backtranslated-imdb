I received this film as a birthday present because all my friends know I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy pitch films delivered. I loved watching their movies at home on rainy nights with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... WHAT HAPPENED? <br /> <br /> This film started with a good concept of changing bugs and also added some brilliant comedy but overall the script is just bad and this was the number one mistake. Ronald K. Armstrong should learn to become a better writer before becoming a director. After reading the Credits we discover that he has given himself the most important role in the film!?! two words Mr. Director "Acting lessons" OK? Mr. Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who launch into their films and this is the mistake number two. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I believe saved this film was the artistic work of the camera and the soundtrack, (let's hear it for the crew!) The cast of other actors that at the beginning of this production seemed a bit cold, really warmed towards the center and at the end of this production. Everyone worked together to bring out this film. Ronald Armstrong may lack the talent to become a decent director or actor, but, I will say this about him, he seems to know how to organize people to make everyone join and pull out his productions. <br /> <This film, I must say, can be an inspiration to any young director who dreams of creating his own film because if Mr. Armstrong was able to pull it out, anyone else can do it too. If you have the chance to watch this movie, watch it for the sake of inspiring you to do "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs bigger and better horror movies to make this genre come back from the grave.
