Usually, I wouldn't waste time reviewing a film like "Human Pork Chop" (the 2001 version, not to be confused with the previous film of the same title, which is probably better known in the West as "The Untold Story"), but since the reviews already here are rather vague about what it actually consists of, I thought it would be better to publish something more detailed, just as no one has ever tried (as I was) to buy it because of the mystical film. Say STAY AWAY. <br /> <br /> **** GREATER SPOILERS are contained under **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop", I expected to be like a Chinese interpretation of the popular movie Japanese "Guinea Pig". Anyone who has seen enough of that series can see where its creators come from. There is a strong sense of humor going through it - you can't watch the ridiculous "He Never Dies" without laughing and "The Making of Guinea Pig "is a fabulous breakthrough of the whole affair on his head, proving that it was just done, with a bit of cheer, by fairly good racing dogs. All the films of the GP have a punk rock, do-it-yourself, a shot-on-video aesthetic, occasional flashes of authentic artistic ability ("Sirena in a manhole"), an aggressive political agenda and a deformed zeal and unbalanced that places them in a league of their own. <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop" has none of this. <br /> <br /> It is filmed on 35mm film (with disarmingly good production values), is 90 minutes long and is completely devoid of all redeems. The plot tells, in flashback to an interview of the police of the suspects, of the systematic torture, of the death and the eventual dismemberment of Grace, a streetwalker drugged by the heroine who is kidnapped and brutalized by her protector and her henchmen when she steals money from him. br /> <br /> Despite the fleeting attempts to be a moral drama, the film has a detached and inhuman feeling and one cannot help but dwell on the mind of those behind it. Although reluctantly he paints Grace as an innocent victim, the petty nature of his script and the constant and vicious dialogue of the protagonist turn towards a shocking, totally unwelcome "he deserves it!" point of view that makes it almost impossible to look at. Much more time is spent describing the degradation of Grace and when her captors are finally found guilty and imprisoned, it seems like a hasty rethink on behalf of writers who have long since ceased to worry less. <br /> <br /> What makes it amazing about why anyone would want to see a movie like that is that even the kind of people who really do MUCH sex and violence in movies would lose a lot. Torture is just a continuous flow of kicks, slaps, verbal abuse, psychological abuse and then more and more bizarre displays of power by the kidnappers use Grace's heroin addiction to force her to make their orders. And when I say it, don't get me wrong, by the way. Unlike "Guinea Pig" with its frequent burst of nudity that gives an almost adolescent feeling of fake titillation towards the procedure despite the ultraviolence, "Human Pork Chop" does not have such sexual connotations. There is no nudity in the film and the violence is performed purely out of malice by the hateful protagonists (who is seen at the beginning of the film who puts a dog in a bag and slams against a brick wall - don't worry, not real, just a special economic effect!). <br /> <br /> The only real bloodshed in the film is towards the end when they break up Grace's body and boil the bones, all very poor special effects (nowhere near "Guinea") Pig " level "and, at that point, you will probably already feel too sad and unhappy not to worry about what's going on. <br /> <br /> The film is depressingly gloomy and uncompromising along a line similar to that of Buddy Giovinazzo "Combat Shock" and I imagine it can also be compared, in the blink of an eye. Both films deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who lives in a nightmare environment devoid of socially or morally redeemable characters and the climax of both films in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable, inevitable ruin of the individual. <br /> <br /> In all honesty, neither "glamourises" is violence (while "Guinea Pig" could easily be blamed for this) but you can't help but wonder where the place is for a film like this. He fails in many real points in his frank presentation of such brutality and with a rhythm of lead, a practically non-existent plot and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, I cannot understand what would encourage someone to look at something like this. I only did it until the end, in order to be able to review it correctly ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 0 of 10. Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
