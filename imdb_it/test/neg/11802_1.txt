Okay, they tell you it's real. They don't list writers or directors, but a vision of this film will be revealed to anyone - It's not real the way you hoped. Speaking rarely sounds like a real natural speech ... but it doesn't even sound like a script. (probably without script). It seemed to me much more like they were always trying to ad-libare. (which they almost always hurt). Therefore, they knew they were making a "movie", not just collecting natural footage. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew they had some points to look for the things that had been created ... and he was just told to ad-lib around everything. <br /> <br /> ************* 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ************************ <br /> <br /> Ok, it's so lame. Every object, point or thing that could be strange or use d as a fright is magically stumbled by these people. Allow me to list the incredibly obvious things that have happened that I remember: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes from the entrance, they light a light switch - sparks of light and a chandelier almost fall over a boy. <br /> <br /> 2) They find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher knife inside * while they explore the cellar. <br /> <br /> 3) They hear a noise inside a closet, so they open the door slowly - BAM - a cat seems to be in there and jumps straight to the camera while screaming. <br /> <br /> 4) Then you notice that there is a hole in the wall, so put your hand inside ... wow, they pulled out a baby doll wrapped in mummy tape. <br /> <br /> 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh it feels "heavy" on here .... BOOM - a chair flies across the room. <br /> <br /> 6) Time to eat. Oh no! The girl who was afraid of insects had a ROACH in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 7) Take the Ouija board ... oops one of the planchette's legs has fallen from the side of the board. This couldn't be because people pushed him, didn't they? (they discover a ghost called Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was that noise in the fireplace ... CLINK - oh my chains fell "I think * he kept people here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now the small girl is going to look for the fireplace ... oh, what is this that sees something ... and is asking the people who are not looking at the fireplace what it is. SWISH - It falls straight on you. (perfect shot) It moves just in time. It was more chain. <br /> <br /> 10) Now we have to separate and "clean up" our designated rooms - it wouldn't be something if things started happening one by one to these people now ... okay: <br /> <br / > CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly his room is shaking ... but nobody loves him. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 1: Actually he says to himself "Charles, it's you Charles ... you can't be you because you're just a figment of my imagination, you're not Charles". Well, guess what, it's knocked over and dragged to the floor. Another lucky photo shoot. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: hear things ... communicate to communicate ... and stand there doing abrasions or something. <br /> <br /> DUDICE # 2: He was in the attic, he reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a splinter ... I don't remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, takes Chick # 2 .. they hear chick and dude # 1 screaming ... they find them chained to a wall and tied to a table. (*) They leave. Cut to black. The final text tells us that they fled safely, they were treated for minor cuts. Since then they have had nightmares and insomnia, we also discover that the next day a 911 call was made naming someone called "Charles". <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Major Spoilers' **************** ********* ********* over ********** ********** <br /> <br /> Ok, when I first heard this movie, I couldn't wait. I thought it would be real. REAL, real. - and more professional, with more professional type people. I love the idea of ​​this kind of stuff, I'd like to see obsessive movies. Before this film was released, I saw couple reviews from people online. They both said how fake and how stupid the people were ... time passed I forgot about the movie .... then I realized that it never came out in theaters. So I found out that he went directly to the video, we rented it ... I discovered that every brutal review was completely true. Too bad, I really wanted it to be beautiful. <br /> <br /> Random thought: the house didn't seem to have TV, radio ... appliances that I remember ... which would have made me think no one lived there for a long time. Above all the house is known to be haunted ... I'm pretty sure no one lives there. But it looks so clean and tidy ... what was a cat doing? The property has no neighbors nearby .... <br /> <br /> All in all, you want to rent it only if you and your friends want to sit and tease it ... or if you've heard about it a long time ago and you he intrigued. (you will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random thought: I think the producer says "The movie you see is real". Well technically it's a real movie right? Real footage of false ghosts? Maybe that was his hole. <br /> <br /> Give this film a star - strictly on the fact that they told the story of Madame LaLaurie. A true New Orleans story. <br /> <br /> The best interpretation was of the boy who taught the participants the ghost hunting equipment at the beginning. Obviously he was really real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
