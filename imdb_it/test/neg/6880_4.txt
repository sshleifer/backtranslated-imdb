I wouldn't call this a good movie, it could even be a bad one. <br /> <br /> BUT there are at least 2 good reasons to keep watching this movie, those are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), both with solid performances. <br /> <br /> They are much better than the rest of the cast, which are pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). <br /> <br /> BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in the "Boys of the suburbs goes to the hood" - script of HAVOC, but here is anything but good to be boring. <br /> <br /> HISTORY is quite decent although nothing special, but it would have been much better since it takes place in LOUSIANNA that some of the children actually incorporated a southern accent, but it doesn't (!). <br /> <br /> Especially in a film in which "the monster" is actually so deeply tied to the popular tradition of Lousianna, with voodoo and so it is simply the stupidity of not including that accent in the characters. <br /> <br /> The only w I did this is the rapper METHOD MAN, he plays Deputy Turner and puts down a good accent in his few scenes, and I want to say if a rapper is able to do it, because they shouldn't the "proffesional" actors be able to do same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very funny in his VERY little role, who knows that the Ticallion Stallion would ever be a cop? Even if only on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a rather stupid but pretty funny Slasher movie, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, this could have been really bad, luckily they are good as usual. <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10, decent, but there are hundreds of best slasher movies out there.
