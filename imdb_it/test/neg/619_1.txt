One of the worst things that a movie studio can do is exploit the tragedies of others, marketing a "shock" or "gore" factor to sell tickets in order to buy their Birch with a new diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to completely misrepresent the true facts of an incredible saga by making events, dialogues and images to the director's liking. Finally, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is use the barrel actors and shoot everything on a sound stage that has been rented for fifty cents a day. All three of these disguises are the culprits of this film. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen thousands of them. A score of "1" is too good for this celluloid waste. Not only should the directors be ashamed for doing so, they should be ashamed to negatively exploit the heroes of this story, who are the people who experienced this tragedy in the first person, both the living and the dead.
