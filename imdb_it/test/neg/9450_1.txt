Dreamland started out moderately interesting but never went anywhere except the city of Tedium. A low affair with no name actors and laughable effects, not recommended for any reason. The best thing that could be said is that they actually filmed it in the Nevada desert. That's right, I can't think of a good thing besides that of this stink. The ending should be a sort of revelation, but it falls to the ground like the rest. Oh, I thought of another positive aspect of this cheese, which is approaching just over an hour, although it is still worn out before then. When the girl starts walking in the desert at night it seems to last forever and continues to get worse from there. Attempts at horror are not at all effective. History is an attempt to feel the style of a twilight zone, but it fails badly. Discover "Retroactive" for a good science fiction movie.
