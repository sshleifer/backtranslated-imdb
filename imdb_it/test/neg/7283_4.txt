HANA-BI has many quiet moments and slow pace. Unfortunately, during the many reflective interludes, the viewer is left to reflect on the recent scenes just watched and many questions overlook and annoy. <br /> <br /> For example, why didn't the boy in the wheelchair drown in the ocean when he was stuck in the sand and the tide was approaching around him? There was no seen or mentioned rescue. <br /> <br /> Can it be true that the Japanese police are so inept and unqualified in arrest procedures that they do not first remove the ability of the suspect to reach a weapon? This Japanese detective police did not seem to have any experience with a suspect. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't the protagonist's right eye flash? Having only one blink of an eye was distracting and was unexplained. <br /> <br /> What exactly was the main character who spends all his money on having to borrow so much from loan sharks? Gambling was not seen. Being a non-entry level government employee, his wife must have had full health insurance. <br /> <br /> What was the single man who did it all alone in the middle of nowhere in the natural park? What was his reason for being there? <br /> <br /> Why would the gangsters find the protagonist and his wife in the distant nature reserve? It didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> And again, how could the bandits later find the protagonist and his wife in the remote Monte. Resort Fuji? There was absolutely no clue available for these gangsters to know in which nation the protagonist and his wife were located, not to mention the correct specific position at the right time at the right time! <br /> <br /> And a third question, how could the younger detectives know which Japanese coast the protagonist and his wife were at? The Japanese coastline must be vast. Did all these characters have psychic powers? <br /> <br /> Two final questions: The cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - WHERE did she come? He seemed to have no means of transport or companions with her. And why in the world did he keep trying to fly what was left of his kite after it was torn to pieces ?! This was strange Inintentionly Python-esque. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, I loved the background music. It was dramatic and smooth and added a lot to this film. Photography, images and art were pleasing to the eye. <br /> <br /> One last point, the wife was overly pleasing to the eye. Not once has she ever come close to looking like a dying sick person. He seemed very healthy. If anything, these people seemed depressed, mentally ill and not physically sick. The husband treated his wife as if a newly released gay man treated a respected wife ... a love for friendship, but not a close tenderness. <br /> <br /> A mixed film for sure.
