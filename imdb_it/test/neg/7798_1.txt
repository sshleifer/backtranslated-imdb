I saw the preview in Femalien and thought it could be a fantastic movie. Turns out, it's a terrible garbage. There is not much nudity in the film, not to mention the fact that we don't have much sex. There were only a few stupid and trivial dialogues along with not interesting dancing that you usually expect to see during the audition. In our case, you might even see it in real movies. Conclusion: I have none for this. Leave it.
