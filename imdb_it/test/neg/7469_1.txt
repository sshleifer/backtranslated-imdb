I saw this movie at the New York New Festival. It was by far the worst movie there. It is the use of total uncircumcised frontal nudity and a screenplay and a direction that does not undertake to reconstruct "Maurice", nor does it decide that it is a Neil LaBute film, makes me feel "Why would anyone ruin such a perfect cast? It lacks irony and fills the void of feeling, which causes the times when the film turns on itself to make you want to wipe your face while your mind and your heart seek what might happen in the film but not Ã¨ I wish the director and the publisher had re-edited the film because maybe there is more history that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
