Who gave these people the money to make a movie? There was nothing funny about this. The fact that the fart dog was the funniest thing about this piece of disease says it all. First of all, it has nothing to do with Christmas, it just took its name and counted on all those people who liked the original Chevy Chase. They took Randy "I'm not talented, I'm just a fat, sweaty pig" Quaid (the only thing wrong with part 1) and made a film about him ... There are only morons in his family, but not they're cute 'they're a little moral, but the' don't touch me 'is a bit of an idiot. Watching this mound of earth helps you to hope that everyone who takes part in it will die! They didn't even bother getting the effects in order ... when I'm in the boat, the only thing moving is the fake background ... when Pigface Quaid is in the water, you can tell from the lighting that is in one study This film was sexist (Uncle Nick), racist (Uncle Nick) and should never have been done ... never ... throwing money into a volcano would have been much more use. <br /> <br /> Well I hope I have reached some of you ... No one warned me and now I am scarred for life Merry F * cking Christmas
