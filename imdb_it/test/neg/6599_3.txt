This film is like so many biopic TV movies I've seen: terrific, exaggerated, misinterpreted and, above all, it's happening too soon. <br /> <br /> What I mean is that the film was shot and, for that matter, aired before Michael Jackson's acquittal of child molestation charges, which I think was one of the most significant periods of Jackson's life and career so far. He probably would have made a great finale to this docu-drama. However, this film is already biting more than it can chew, staging too many details in this over-ambitious project. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician, not to mention the modern-day pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six specials Behind the Music to tell with precision. This film tried to tell too much in three hours, and needless to say, it failed. <br /> <br /> Flex Alexander did everything he could to play Jackson, but it became more like an SNL caricature of the likes of Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would certainly be rather difficult to find someone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting the King of Pop and studying his methods of madness. However, with a small budget, you can only depend on what they see in the tabloids, and they don't necessarily give an accurate representation. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the director's efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely insane. Alexander's face make-up makes it look more like a reverse minstrel show, and everyone who has been to a grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. It is also surprising to me that the movie documents Jackson going under the knife to get a cosmetic surgery, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same size as his nose. This kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects cannot hold up for television viewers in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> It was even more annoying when the filming of the real Michael Jackson (ie the time he hung his little baby on a balcony in Germany) was interspersed in the film in real time. It was a good test, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> If this film came out in theaters, it would only make a profit for its fussiness. It compares to "Mommie Dearest", and this is saying a lot. Above all, this was a film that he probably was quick to make, like many TV movies that aren't on HBO. It could have been done much better if he had just talked about an aspect of Jackson's life. Even if it only covered allegations of child molestation, it would probably have been done much better and would have been even more intriguing.
