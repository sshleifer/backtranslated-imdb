I just saw this today on TCM, where other reviewers saw it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I was the only one who found Davies a weak actress, with a really terrible attempt in an Irish (Irish-American or otherwise) accent. Since it's the star, it was a bit difficult for me to overcome it - especially since other reviewers said that this was his best performance. <br /> <br /> Another particularly terrible performance by Davies was in "Marianne" (1929), which I also saw today. In this film, given a 9 out of 10 rating, his accent shifts from that of a (correct) French woman to a strange combination of Italian and Swiss. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that in the one-hour MTC biography of Davies - "Captured in the movie: the true story of Marion Davies" (2001) - the film historian Jeanine Basinger states that "one of the things you notice about Marion Davies in his sound work is how good he is at making accents. "Of course this biography also includes fan comments (do whatever you want). Davies was a very attractive young woman and, by all accounts, a formidable comedy in real life. <br /> <br /> And because a part of his anatomy has added immeasurably to the response of real life in search of the character of Joseph Cotten for the meaning behind Kane's last word in the opening scene of the great "Citizen Kane ", has earned its place among the great stories if the history of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> But I think that Welles & Mankiewicz understood this for the most part with the facsimile "Susan Alexander" of the real article. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time voting on whether you agree or disagree with this post, I really couldn't care less.
