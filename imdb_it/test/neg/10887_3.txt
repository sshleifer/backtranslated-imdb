SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre .... if you've seen them, don't waste time with this. Typical slasher film, nothing new here except the "visions" of SPOILER that add a little lint to an already weak plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to look at and you can watch this movie or watch a bare wall for 1.5 hours. The only semi-interesting SPOILER part is when the chick starts drinking in the empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because at least it made good use of that liquor instead of using it stereotyped to light a fire to kill the bad guy, even she made that road towards the end. All in all, lame, bad, and not worth it.
