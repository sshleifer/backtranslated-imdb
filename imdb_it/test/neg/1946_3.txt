The film had an interesting surprise. A little psychologically compelling. And the producers could have closed it with taste without making it just another outburst of films released by Hollywood to promote homosexuality and / or other sexual deviations. This could have ended with a "pay-off", but there were other reasons behind the pen. What drives me crazy is the mud that sticks to your face AFTER you see the whole movie. Like the disappointing "The talent of Mr. Ripley". Yes of course, I'm just another Puritan. This gay content has tarnished the entire film. I would not judge positively a film for artistic value or entertainment if its only purpose was to promote a further political motivation, especially for this.
