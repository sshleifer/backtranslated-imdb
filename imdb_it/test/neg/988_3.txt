Being a history buff, I rented this movie because of the subject. The idea of ​​the Ellis Island experience at the end of the century that focuses on a small group is intriguing. Unfortunately, the film is flat. Much of the story is simply boring; it doesn't happen much for long stretches. The director uses silly images (offered in the form of sequences of daydreams) in an apparent attempt to break the glacial rhythm, but instead clashes with the look and authentic look of the film. Even the characters are poorly designed. In the end, we don't care as much about them as we should. It is a pity that this was not what could have been. I would still like to see a good film about the experience of American immigrants, but this is not the case.
