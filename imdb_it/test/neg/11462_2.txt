Is it really possible that so many people in this movie believe that the girl is a witch? Just because she has dark hair and wears dark makeup should she be a witch? And I had the impression that the film was trying to present it as someone who is "different", someone that nobody understands ... She's just a teenager and a dumb girl from her school says she's a witch and everyone believes her. Also, Brandi is portrayed very badly or the character himself is made to be so ... False. He did not convince me that he is not a witch, not that I would believe in the first place. Everyone accuses her of being a witch and behaves as if she is not entirely sure that she is a witch or not. And the way they dressed for the court - I see old women every day who wouldn't wear them even if it was the last dress in the world! Even Brandi's brother was not very convincing ... But, you see, the important thing is that "he put that bad and bad girl on the ground at the end of the film". "He won the battle, he showed everyone that it is different". <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the worst films I saw in May, too superficial. I only saw it because at the moment there was nothing else on TV, so I was sentenced to this garbage. Please don't waste your time watching this movie. When I saw the score of 7 stars, I almost fainted ... It doesn't deserve it, compared to other films that are also classified with 7 stars.
