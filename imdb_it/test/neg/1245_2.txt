What could have been a great movie about the late poker pro (pre-poker mania) Stu "The Kid" Unger turned into a disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can say that the directors were working on a short budget string. Everything seems to have turned low cost. The timelines seemed a little strange to me. <br /> <br /> The casting of Michael Imperoli of the Sopranos was also a bad choice. He seemed too old to play Stu as a child, he looked too healthy for a cocaine addict (if you watch the shooting of the 1997 WSOP main event, the real Stu was so skinny and practically didn't have too much cocaine nose so he wore those glasses alone to hide them), and I kept expecting Adriana to appear and scream "Chris-tu-phur !!!" <br /> <br /> They also jumped on the fact that he had a son from Angie's previous relationship that he committed suicide in the late 1980s. <br /> <br /> Whenever I saw Vincent Van Patten appear, I kept thinking he was about to announce "Show tunes going off in the Stu's head". as it does on the WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a real Stuey movie, check out ESPN Classic because it re-runs the 1997 WSOP Main Event from time to time. Or try YouTube. Avoid this move as a bad blow.
