At first it seems a rather innocent choice: the name "employee of the month" could sound like bells with "Office Space" and the show "Office employee". I do not think so. This is not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, whoever the boy's name was, was a complete idiot and had a sick and perverse mind. There is no pleasure in being induced to feel sorry for a complete loser who cheats on his wife, steals from his first-rate work, and lies between his teeth 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. room when my family is looking at him (and believe me, they were just looking more because they were praying that in the end there was at least some relief, maybe even some fairy tale, sending a warm message of good justice done and when the good guys are fine). All the good guys were killed so long ago that they didn't have time to look good. No memorial has been made. <br /> <br /> This film has borderline madness. He does not respect the elderly, the dead and women - and the director tries to please people. <br /> <br /> I gave this film only two because the soundtrack was good. But even that wasn't all that was memorable. If you have been lucky enough not to see it in theaters, ultimately, my friends, don't do it at home.
