This film suffers terribly from his "Julian Grant" direction, and his incompetent protagonist, Steve Guttenberg, who is making an effort to win a competition similar to Bruce Willis! The script is a reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates give a decent performance. The film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I wonder what the Hollywood studios thought, actually giving the green light to a weak director like Grant. And I would say to Sean Bean "what you were thinking, even considering taking part in a movie like this, after movies like GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!
