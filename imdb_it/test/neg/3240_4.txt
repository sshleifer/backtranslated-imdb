So many critics, he made me ask, what do people think when they watch a simple film made by a rather bad director ??? Did you all expect an impeccably successful film ?? No way, you can already see, Raj Kumar Kohli loves multi-starrer movies ... All his previous works were multi-starrers, but none was perfect. Take the first Jaani Dushman for example, so many flaws, but still have fun. However, the film Jaani Dushman is a Hindi fantasy film about a snake, which can take any form (Armaan (Munish) Kohli) that takes revenge for the suicide of its lover (Manisha Koirala) on the people who caused it. It's pretty good, with a big cast of stars. But I think it could have been a lot better. For example, take the script, you can't say it's flawless. For example Get the ages: <br /> <br /> Do you still study at the university for 40-48 years? <br /> <br /> There are many many others, I won't list more, but there are dozens more. A solid 5.5 is good for this. <br /> <br /> **. 75
