Enough talent and sincerity have gone to make this film I wish it were better. Everyone is clearly doing his best to be faithful to an intriguing premise, but it is too deep a vision, even an implicit attempt to untangle the mental illusion to survive a transition to the screen. It is an attempt to capture the dimensionality of the spider web patterns on celluloid: the result is confused and slow. I give him a 10 for effort, but an overall 5.
