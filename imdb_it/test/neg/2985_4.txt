Sometimes you just have to have patients while you watch the horror indie. If you can only make your way through the first scenes of the slow rhythm, sometimes a real gem will present itself ... This (unfortunately) was not the case with "Satan's Whip". <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Jason Maran, "Satan's Whip" attempts to drag us on a boring film festival, without a real reward at the end. I guess black and white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, but it was never explained because most of the blood is blue, and I found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. The story itself is not so bad, and actually has had originality and decent content, but acting is simply pathetic. This combined with the slow pace and lack of a true (red) gore made "Satan's Whip" to forget pretty quickly. I will give a score of "4" for a witty dialogue that made me laugh, but unfortunately it was not possible to save this boring waste of my time.
