I watched this year on television when I was sick (I don't know, I tend to be more complacent with my TV viewing when I'm sick, too much effort to use the remote, I guess). <Br /> <br /> From what I can remember, every aspect of the film - casting, acting, writing, directing, etc. - was badly advised at best. I could have forgiven the historical inaccuracies if this film had created a sense of what it was like to work on Trinity; But it was not so. There have been attempts to humanize the scientists, but they were insufficient and have never transcended caricature. <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about the people involved in the Manhattan Project at the time, but the portraits in the film were so cartoon that I became interested in knowing the real personalities. And I did it. So I guess this horrible movie did a small amount of good, after all. <br /> <br /> It is not a thorough review, but FMLB does not deserve or require one. You could have fun if you're a fan of bad movies.
