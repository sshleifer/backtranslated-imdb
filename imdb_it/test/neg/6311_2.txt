It's really terrible. Quaid overhangs more than Shatner. The part where Elvis comes in and says "You can have it all" kills everything that might have been good in this movie that is bad enough. Drug use was completely covered in snow, the only thing he had to do with his life was that he married his cousin. Quaid doesn't even look like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be redone in the future with someone who didn't try so hard. A bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more on his real life. I was very, very disappointed with Quaid. Don't watch this movie or you will be too.
