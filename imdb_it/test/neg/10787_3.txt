I think the manuscript of this film was written on the piece of toilet paper. No respect for many important details that intrinsically make the film. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What kind of names are they? Definitely not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What a name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably an implication on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, there have never been any cases of terrorism committed by the Serbs. A journalist like the main character should have known. Thirdly, the actors who play Serbian terrorists are not even Serbs or speak Serbo-Croatian. Apart from this, this film is solidly interpreted but the plot is very thin and full of holes. Sometimes it makes absolutely no sense !!!
