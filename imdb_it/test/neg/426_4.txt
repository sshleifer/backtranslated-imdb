Jeff Speakman has never managed to go beyond the lower ranks of martial artists - actors-actors (lower than Don "The Dragon" Wilson, for example), and with vehicles like "The Expert", you can see why. There are three main problems with this film: 1) The plot - or should I say conspiracies - are everywhere, there are some characters that get a lot of time on the screen but little is needed, 2) There are only 4 combat scenes in total, some of they are completely unrelated to the main plot and some that take place in the dark, 3) The soundtrack is overly zealous and overbearing. Strange as it may seem, this is really the most annoying thing about this movie: the soundtrack constantly tries to convince you that you're looking at some sort of great epic instead of the low-budget, limited-action movie you're actually watching. With all that said, at least there is James Brolin around giving a touch of credibility. * 1/2 out of 4.
