I saw this movie that I thought was a promising start, but then it made me feel disappointed in the end. The problem I think with this film is that the director was trying a little hard to make this film strange and original. There were too many flashbacks and too many negative "effects" that bothered me during the movie. I love Debbie Harry and Isaac Hayes, but they disappointed me in this film, they could do a lot better. This film looked promising in the beginning, dragged in half and then disappointing in the end. The film has never been able to beat the genius of Stanley Kubrick when it comes to controversial issues, strangeness and originality in films.
