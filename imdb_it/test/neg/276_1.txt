The man I loved the Ocean's 11 movie. <br /> <br />. All eleven characters were crucial to the robbery as each had its own specialized skill needed to bring out the grand finale. <br /> <br /> What the hell was Oceans 12? What was the purpose of the twelfth person? I assume it should be Zeta-Jones, but she wasn't really part of the 11 while trying to make them stumble and work against them for the whole movie ?? It was more like the story of Brad and Zeta-Jones's characters weaving a boring relationship with parts of the original film, thrown away just to have bad seats to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> With O-11, the band was always one step ahead of Benedict (Garcia). They have always been able to overcome it. What happened here? Do you reach them after a tip and suddenly they are all screwed? The whole film is so that they can collect the money that has stolen the most interest to repay Benedict for the blow they did 3 years ago. So the next movie will develop courage and brains again and bring it back for paying off for the first robbery? Puh-lease ... <br /> <br /> This film could only have been made with Brad Pitt, Zeta-Jones and 5 minutes of Matt Damon for the switcheroo scene. <br /> <br /> Slow moving films not the energy of the first. I tried to like it and I'm usually very easy to please but I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER !!! The twist: it was not necessary to create the entire movie because the real shot was made before all you just saw in the last 2 hours. <br /> <br /> FINAL SPOILER. <br /> <br /> Wait for it to come on TV or if you're a fan of the 2001 original, please don't watch it.
