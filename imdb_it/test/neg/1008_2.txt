This film could very well be a propaganda film for the Phalangist party in North America - or a similar group ... The strong man (Kersey) stands above the law (but not outside the law) and frees honest citizens killing useless waste. The only thing that made me think it was not done by the KKK was the fact that a Jew acted as a good boy ... Try looking at him again as you think of him as a propaganda film for an extreme group right - and you We'll see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> It's a tragedy that Jimmy Page really made music for this movie ... :(
