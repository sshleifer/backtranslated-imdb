This movie stinks. No money, no acting, nothing. I took the third movie on the program tonight and I felt compelled to comment on it. This film has nothing to recommend. I can't believe he was ever released on American television! No one in this film can act out of a paper bag. The lame comedy attempts fall on their face, the special effects consist of a "monster" similar to a worm-like wand ... I can't even begin to tell you how much this production was. It seems like they cost maybe $ 50,000 to shoot, but only because it's about 16mm, and it's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I lost interest quickly and had to settle for watching "Matlock" replicas instead of finishing it. Here's how BAD is this movie !!!
