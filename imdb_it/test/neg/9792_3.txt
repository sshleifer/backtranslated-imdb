It is impossible to make a film based on a book like "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostoyevsky. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the film was the end. Well, let's think about the book. In the end we have the "guilty" Dimitrij Karamazov. Later they sent him to Siberia. In the end, the famous epilogues of Dostojevsky, friends and family who make a plan to save him. But that's all ... and now the film takes two more steps and shows us an illusion that ends with the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka (I think). only from the moral point of view I am sure that Dostojevsky would end the book with an open end because on the one hand he is not guilty (Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and therefore he must be a free man. But on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him, so he decided to commit the crime ... this is a moral dilemma and therefore the next point is an open end ... well, really, it's not just full open. <br /> <br /> William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! <br /> <br /> The other characters perform well, as we should expect from such great actors ... In front, of course, of a superb performance by Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way. <br /> <br /> But as I said at the beginning: this book is not adaptable. It should never be a movie in two hours impossible. I think there are a few longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing ... But I still believe this book can't be adapted. <br /> <br /> I know - 3 points: <br /> <br /> A point for the great director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> A point for a superb interpretation of Yul Brynner <br /> <br /> Finally: a point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky
