Every once in a while some amateur comes out with a tired piece of action movies. this is so wrong that I don't think I have to even comment on the plot, the acting, the script, the work with the camera. because he has none !! If putting a muscular guy in a cool leather jacket that walks in slow-mo and throwing a funky rap song is the main ingredient of a great action movie, then sayonara action movie !!
