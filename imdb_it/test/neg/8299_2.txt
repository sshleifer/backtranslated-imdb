Okay, if you like your monstrous, stiff, starchy and boringly monstrous moovies, but with a lot of bottlenecks, then go right to "Lady Frankenstein", an Italian corpse of corpses. Joseph Cotten ("Citizen Kane") plays the old old baron and must have really needed to pay for that building. The sexy Sarah Bay, who starred in unscrupulous European B-movies, usually as Rosabla Neri, including "Hercules Against the Moon Men", plays her ambitious daughter, a surgeon in a ruffled ball gown. Cotten makes an ugly big-headed monster (cud really much to do to make a nice one ??), which immediately strangles Cotten (who took his allowance for royalty and runs) and wanders around bypassing everyone in sight. Tania (Bay) decides to change the brain of her lover (who is old and wrinkled) with the brain of a younger man (who is "handsome", but stooopid), to make another monster strangle the first monster that Cotten he did, wandering around to strangle people. Well, after a lot of exposure and a little throttle, the 2 monsters choke for a while, Tania stabs the first monster in the back, and then has sex in the flaming ruins of her villa with the second monster - just to make him speed up her! Doh! There are so many bottlenecks going on that we always overlook the fact that the film is as exciting as a dead carp, and it moves just as fast. The version of Alpha Video I saw for this review has been heavily modified, and it's no wonder that a lot of nekkid people have been cut off, not that it would have greatly improved the movie. The director von Theurmer previously directed a series of Euro-trash level Z, including "Jungle Warriors", "Island of the Dead" (like Mel Wells) and "The Crucified Girls of San Ramon". The MooCow says to avoid this corpse of a movie, and to find something that moves like a full ... accelerator. <br /> <br />; = 8)
