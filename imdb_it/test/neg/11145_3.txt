All the hype! All the add! I was tired of losing this on the big screen. Where this film worked was in the small details. In ALL the rest has failed. Arnold has done many better performances in recent years. I thought the days of Commando and Last Action Hero had disappeared from our lives. Unfortunately this film follows the lowest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a bellow, a grunt, a twisted muscle that knows how to shoot guns and blow things up. In a clich√© at the last moment (and at another time), which was predictable from the start, we see a glimpse of the actor who proved to be more than what was paid for at the beginning of his career. I was not impressed by the film because it never opened new horizons or went everywhere, but where it was expected to happen.
