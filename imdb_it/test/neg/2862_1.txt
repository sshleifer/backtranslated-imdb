When I first heard about this movie, I came out with enthusiasm to rent it, believing (mistakenly) that it was one of those funny and funny movies I liked. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> For beginners, the pace is distressing, incredibly slow. The pace doesn't even begin to rise until the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The plot was boring and the ending was meaningless and confusing. For those looking for a tacky horror movie with cheap thrills, look elsewhere. This film provides carefree, but is lacking in "chills", cheap or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Try "Child's Play" instead.
