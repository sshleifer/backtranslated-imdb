Stay Alive is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die in the game. Friends who play this game soon find out, and then realize that they must defeat the Bloody Countess from the video game or accept their fate. We recorded videotapes in The Ring, a deadly site in FearDotCom. Now it's about video games. Stay Alive does some things well; character development is a bit deeper than it would be in a horror movie. We really see feelings and the past in some of the characters and we all know them pretty well, so the audience could get emotions for them. The film is also very suspenseful. Tense and unnerving moments are often interpreted in the film, accompanied by disturbing and disturbing music. There are lots of jumps and shakes for the viewer. This may be ideal once or twice, but these false flaws that Hollywood seems to enjoy an excess of horror films nowadays fade into Stay Alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes to give viewers a quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen. Why? The gore is obviously very weak due to the film's certificate. The Stay Alive script is very vulgar and quite laughable, and the characters tend to interpret it too melodramatically and confused. Moreover, clich√©s come from every direction, for example people who wander on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have identified a figure in the dark, they will go to investigate it. However, the computer graphics used for the video game segments is quite impressive and looks colorful and sharp, working well with other parts of the film. But overall, there's not enough to resist this movie. Stretching to just over a hundred minutes, it won't be a battle to stay alive, but rather, Stay Awake.
