When I think of a 1970 movie, this is not what I think. I don't want a monotonous soundtrack by Robin Trower; I want a soundtrack dotted with the best bubblegum songs of the day that embodied the 70s. The generic karaoke-style disco music during the dance scene was particularly annoying. The acting (if you can call it that) was a lot of wood, and it seemed just read by the script in monotone. The quality of the film and the work with the camera were horrible; the obscure dialogue, the script seemed thrown together without thinking too much and the plot was thin if not non-existent. I can't believe people are giving the high scores I read here. Basically a miserable, miserable attempt to recreate a beloved epoch of the past. Two stars are all I can invent. Sorry guys.
