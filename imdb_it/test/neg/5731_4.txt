It is sad that Schwarzenegger was the best thing about this production, especially considering the fact that he had not yet arrived alone, and was still as rigid as the cardboard in his delivery of dialogues. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is not as bad as some critics say, but it's not even good. It is fun and plays like a poor country cousin of Conan's line, making it a conflictual, unequal, poor job. And speaking of the poor, the quality is terrible, due to the era in which it was shot, but it is not the only reason. <br /> <br /> The story here is inferior, even to the Conan line, but what's more, it gets lost in the "Red Sonja must be dominated by a strong Schwarzenegger ploy" and completely forgets its purpose, if it ever had one. <br /> <br /> It's fun, but in a low budget, guilty - consider "B" mode. <br /> <br /> Evaluate a 4.2 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Demon :.
