Oh god why? I am horrified by the sheer ineptitude of this delightful nonsense ... if all this makes sense. Well, like in this 1940 Hollywood movie, at the bottom of the poverty line, none of this slamming of the door - made on three sets - makes a lot of sense ... except for Dr Markoff's horny (jerkoff?) Che craves uncontrollably after a piano plonky daughter of the player who has large melons and a ruffled hairstyle. It's just terrible ... and even has a gorilla and a big dog for unnecessary distractions. More Elephantine Elephant and this is only 62 minutes! .... THE MONSTER MAKER is the kind of film that the children in 2005 shouted in disbelief and wonder that the hell they saw their grandparents in their youth that made them the adorable movies they are today. I guess you had to be there. In 1944 or when this crazy madness was shown to impressionable thirteen in splendid velvet palaces of 3000 seats on a wet day. Somehow. It was done without reason by the scammers of the Crapshooter film of botchville during the war years during the war by escaped German refugees who knew who to make a film since they left Europe while the Nazis made progress in the UFA studies ... the monster in this movie, like the mad scientist is actually a Nazi nightmare.
