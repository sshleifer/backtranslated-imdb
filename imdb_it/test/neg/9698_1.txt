NBC had the chance to create a powerful religious epic along the lines of "The Ten Commandments" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told", and instead chose to create a rather lukewarm cartoon that was more like "Waterworld" than any else. I don't remember a passage in the Bible where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember one in which Noah's son develops a serious friendship with an orange, nor do I remember that Noah is a crazy old fool who suddenly entails as if it were commanding a naval fleet and running around shouting nautical terms such as "raising the support!" This was probably the worst marketing decision in history. Obviously most of the people watching this would be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why on earth make the movie so offensive to those people? If they were intentionally trying to offend, why not advertise it that way and at least attract the right audience? I hope that one day they will make a real Noah movie, one made seriously and thoughtfully, one that really attracts people and makes money. Until then, don't waste your time with this garbage.
