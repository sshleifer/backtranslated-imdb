Let me say that this new He-Man comic book is not destroying childhood memories, because I didn't even like the old He-Man cartoon. I loved the action figures, but I found the cartoon to be rude and I hated the plot (the He-Man I liked was one of the very first pre-cartoon mini-comics included in the box figures, where He-Man was a barbarous, the Sword of Power was divided into two parts, and there was no Prince Adam, no premise of Shazam and no Orko). However, we leave the old things alone. <br /> <br /> The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is a disgrace in itself, representing both the worst case histories of the old show and the worst trends today. I looked at it because I had heard that the moral in the face of the old show was (thankfully) gone, and this had more sword play and character development. But I met a terrible mixture of the worst clichés of the genre, characters that I could not avoid hating, and the sadly inevitable visual style of the Matrix. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good idea to give a little background to the characters, as it showed a pre-face peeling Skeletor, but that's how the character development goes, except for the usual garbage which reaches the years I see in the following episodes, where this teenybopper Adam will learn the responsibility of his new acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show Adam was not a spoiled brat! I found myself hating his insides. This is what we get when they publish an adventurous show for pre-teens: pretty faces and young-cool-and-look-youth dresses. I should check the new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special appearance. Friend, this show reminds me of the 1996 Flash Gordon stinkbomb comic! <br /> <br /> Dialogue? Has! It absolutely follows every cliché in the book, from Randor's good-lil-two-shoes in Skeletor's immortal opening scene "Oh, and He-Man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is always the same high tone compared to the old series. 20 years, and nothing we have learned. <br /> <br /> And of course, nowadays there cannot be anything remotely related to the action that is not Matrix style. Leave Anime to the Japanese, people, think of new ideas. And seeing the characters' poses during the fights did not help. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have our usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I think about it, who the hell brings up these names?) doesn't have yellow skin now, but gray-ish. Oh, so no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu won't appear on the show either. The nuances of the 1996 FG again, where Ming the Merciless was a green alien, similar to a toad! <br /> <br /> People complain about Cringer's lack of language. I don't think I would have liked this more or less if Cringer had spoken, it's pretty corny this way. And you have your extra ration of cheese with Orko! The shocking thing is probably many of the people who (rightly) hate Jar Jar Binks, could be big Orko fans ... <br /> <br /> I've seen the feature film pilot and I've had enough. Leave the series alone. 2 out of 10.
