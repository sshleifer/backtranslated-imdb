Hmmmmmmm - massacre of cheerleaders. Let me think: the high school girls are falling apart, except the pretty one survives. Done. The next movie. <br /> <br /> It actually surprised me that this was done in 2003. I really thought they would stop making these films in the 1980s. This was really your version of the grinding film with teenagers who love eyes, mute horn dogs, even an adult male fool and a hot teacher. Continue on the list of the dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods. We have already seen all this. <br /> <br /> However this has had some interesting twists that put it above the normal I-even the cuts, so if you have a couple of brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill: you could do with worse.
