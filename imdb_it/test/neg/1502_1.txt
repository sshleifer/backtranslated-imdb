THERE'S NO WAY ! I hated my grandmother. First, it's too high - of course it is, it's Tom, anyone's brother, who plays it - and I hate that thing he does when he brushes his fake silver hair, but: there are fun parts in this movie. For example, the fact that every single actor looks at V.G. (very German), and also that they think that, even if left alone, they should pretend that that guy (Tom) is their real "grandmother" or something. I particularly liked - not - that moment when Charlotte leaves and starts walking towards the nearest gas station to ask for help. He suddenly finds himself in the middle of some woods (where these were before? Nobody dares to explain) and he turns, turns around, turns like a dancer, looking at the stars ... and ... ignoring the fact that GRANNY IS BACK READY TO STRIKE !!! But, anyway, the music wasn't so bad, the haircuts were ok and the ending terribly provocative ... Mmmmm ... I wish I had the German version.
