Movies like this make me infuriated simply because they don't deserve the funding that allows them to end up in my DVD player. This film is ambiguous in his blurb jacket and even more impenetrable in his casting choices (why did Ms. Song have a romantic interest? They just wanted an Asian woman in there, or her unconvinced wise character actually lend this "message" story of the film a new perspective)? One has very little to do to get closer to this film, and even less while the plot takes place. But after a good hour of the proceedings, I realized that boring casting is all that the casting agent could bring up, studies of unconvincing characters are the result of the fart of the writers' brains, and the story is amorphous and tormented from unclear references to the troubles of capitalism, materialism, and moving forward in the postmodern world. Towards the end of this film, just before nodding and losing the last two minutes, I had the feeling that "Everything's Gone Green" was a product of "connections" in the film world - someone with a very small talent knew someone with very little directorial skill, he knew someone who had absolutely no marketing sense (but a lot of throwaway ego) and had made out of this boring and inefficient attempt at nonsensical nonsense and humor-with-a-conscence. And this is the most exasperating: how many infinitely better scripts have been handed down in favor of this almost unwatchable tripe? Skip this movie and feel good about yourself for doing it.
