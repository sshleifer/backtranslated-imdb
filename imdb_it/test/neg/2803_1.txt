Rent this movie only if you feel like laughing (out of pure stupidity), because this movie wouldn't scare a lot of kindergarten kids during a Halloween party! The problem is that there is too much blood for children, so definitely don't put it in your VCR for kids. It starts with a little promise, giving the impression that the cover artist may have actually started watching this film before drawing the cover, but then quickly descend into an epic stupidity. The "scarecrows" are clumsy idiots who are as frightening as those of the Wizard of Oz, but not as clever. If they had just had a brain ...? I got this movie for $ 1.20 at a local discount / store close-out and even so, I feel a little ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here, if you actually pay to see this, you can only blame yourself.
