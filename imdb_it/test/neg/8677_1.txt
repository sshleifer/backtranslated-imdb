I doubt that anyone who wrote this script ever actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they did it wasn't very good. None of the characters is what they should be: Fanny is lively and aware of her abuse, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally fallen into the personality of Aunt Norris. Furthermore, a Fanny first-person narrative is highly inappropriate for both the story and her character. Fanny is not a funny hero, and I would say that she is not meant to be. Moreover, in the film version, Fanny flirts shamelessly with Edmund from the beginning, when they grew up as brothers and sisters! Austen's Fanny would have retired from flirting of any kind, and the novel depicts the Fanny / Edmund mating as very uncomfortable ... as it should be. Unlike other novels by Jane Austen (P & P, Emma), Mansfield Park is not based on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a type of novel very different from the others; it is not meant to be a love story. I saw this movie because I just finished reading Mansfield Park and I am absolutely horrified by what I see; Miss Austen is rolling into her grave.
