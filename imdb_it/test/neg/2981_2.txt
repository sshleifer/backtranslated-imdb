I saw that this movie was coming out and I couldn't wait to see it. I must say that I was very disappointed with this. It would have been better as a mini series. The whole show seemed very rushed. They have not explained things very clearly. In the end they showed John Paul II, alive and well and the next scene was dead. Never any explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life.) I think the ABC dropped the ball big in something that could have been great. In all I think this film has been blurred. It seemed that a drunken monkey jumped from one point in John Paul's life to another point, never explaining how or why things had happened. As when the older brother leaves, it has never been explained that his brother was a doctor and for this he left home. Even when his father dies, all we see is his father just lying on the floor. I was very disappointed with the film.
