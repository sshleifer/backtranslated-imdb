This noisy and dizzying film by director Oliver Stone seems to have everyone in the cast - well, all but William H. Macy, who could have played the role of Mr. Stone, the team's doctors, or the "fruit pie" sells cereals. If you are a fan of mouth-opening mouth, there are some phrases that have been knocked down, dragging, driving and profane, that you can try on two-faced friends and way-ward lovers. The film is sometimes as good as a lively party atmosphere in the background, especially during the first two hours; also features some MTV-style music video scenes. <br /> <br /> ** Any Given Sunday (12/16/99) Oliver Stone ~ Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid
