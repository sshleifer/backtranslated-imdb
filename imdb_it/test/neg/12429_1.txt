Something strange is happening at Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear, nor cold. A giant plastic robot monster emerges and kills the Scots! What is this movie? First of all, I like to read stories about Nessie, sea monsters in general. When I saw this for sale, I thought it was an economic rip-off of the jaws. No. It was terrible! The plot was useless, the acting was 100% junk, the only side was the cold mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracies, wrong places and all very bad. It's not worth it, leave it on the shelf (or garbage can) where you found it. Secondly, this film was shot in Cailifornia, not in Loch Ness, a major disaster for Nessie fans.
