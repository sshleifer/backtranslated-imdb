Before watching this film (in a screening in which the director herself took part) we were informed that this had won the award for the short film at the Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result will give hope to filmmakers, anyone can do better than this! <br /> <br /> As no one can see the flagrant scam of Donnie Darko in this I'll never know. The film is pure drivel, the acting cartoon, the ridiculous dialogue and the simply flat ending! The only bit of comfort that we liked after seeing this garbage was to comment out loud how terrible it was in front of the director! Yes, it was petty, but liberating! <br /> <br /> At least Irish cinema cannot sink lower!
