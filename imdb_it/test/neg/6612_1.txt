This film is TRASH from the beginning. First, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 YEARS AGO! Who cares? This film had the same depth as a bottle cap. Makes a complex person like Bob Knight in a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> The curses don't bother me, but I'm still stunned by the fact that ESPN showed a film with more curses than a Kevin Smith movie on a cable channel basis. The word F was issued at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was awful and anyone who associated with this should be embarrassed. I consider this to be on the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge and Everybody Wins ... 2 films that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
