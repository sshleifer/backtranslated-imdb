I took this film because it caught my eye as a film with a focus on Jewish comedy, something I had never seen before. <br /> <br /> I approached this film with an open mind and was interested in how it started. The opening is well done, and the first half of the film gave me a lot of reasons to laugh, and that's good. <br /> <br /> However, the humor soon became repetitive, the plot became confused and tense, and I realized that I was no longer enjoying the movie. I tried to avoid saying this, but the film became rather "cheap" - it's not a bad thing for a comedy if the humor holds up, but it's not. I confess that I lost part of the humor, of not being Jewish and having little experience with Jewish culture. However, considering how heavily the bulk of the humor was telegraphed in this film, I am unlikely to have missed much. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, and maybe if you thought about it a little more the film would have been watchable to the end. I wish I could give the film a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would have been better as a TV series or as a series of skits. There was not enough useful material for a feature film. <br /> <br /> Something to say about casting: the main role seemed to have been designed with Ben Stiller in mind, but I don't think the film would have been more useful if it had been inside.
