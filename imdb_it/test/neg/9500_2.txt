Yah. I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, believe me! I rented it thinking it was a film I missed in theaters. It is not. It is a garbage "movie" made by the Showtime guys (cable station). Damn, these cable stations make a few bucks that they think they can make any junk movie they want! It's not good. I'm a big Sinatra fan like any sane man, but this movie was just stupid. Boring. Boring. Unfunny. Not interesting. The only thing that redeems is that (assuming the facts are adhered to) you learn what happened to the kidnappers of Frank Jr. Otherwise it's just a stupid movie.
