Here is a film that clearly points to the fact of being advertised as exoticism towards an audience that is not familiar with its theme. <br /> <br /> An attempt to hybrid between fiction and document, "Kadosh" falls awkwardly between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither precise nor perceptive. To realize its carelessness in detail management, it is not necessary to go beyond the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to put the film correctly. More generally, the boring presentation of rote-style details (in this case the ultra-orthodox Jewish rite) is the role of a manual, not a good documentary; the latter should provide an organizational principle (a gestalt, if you want) for the viewer, so that it can emerge with a better understanding of the visa. This clearly does not happen here, as the ultra-orthodox ritual is made even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining everything verbally during the film's release campaign; cinematically, however, this is a serious case of stuttering. As a feature of fiction, on the other hand, he suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of plot and frankness of the message. In some places I heard that I was watching a cartoon. (for example, the scene of the completion of the wedding night - without going into detail in angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically this could not be a realistic portrait of human sex, however wild it may be.) <br / > <br /> There are no subtleties in this film. The ingenious manipulation of the suggestions, which stimulates the imagination and the viewer's thought to take an active part in the cinematographic text, which I believe is a sign of a good characteristic, is completely absent. On the contrary: watching the film I felt, at times, forcedly fed again and again with the same content already chewed and too obvious. It is, in fact, as the director Gitai himself put in an interview, an "moving objects in the architectural space", and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when requested and advancing the plot on his appropriate and predictable track; but the spark, that creative sparkle, duende-similar, obscure and inarticulate (let's not forget that "Kadosh" is presumably a tragedy), which projects the spell that transforms it into an extension of the world of viewers on a two-dimensional screen it is missing without leaving a trace. Perhaps a work of a visual engineer, perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologist; definitely not a real director. What I saw was a game of passion for animated issues rather than for real people of flesh and blood. Acting, on the whole, has failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea that is forced (sometimes even tortured) to the cinema. A notable exception, although relatively minor, was that of the mikve-lady and her mother, both played by the excellent and experienced Lea Koenig. <br /> <br /> It takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula (that is, a portion of exoticism, plus a harrowing but simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to tease my buds of interest. The bottom line here, all said, is that for a considerable part of the film I was simply bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even the pioneering realization of the use of an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a film set, for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserve all the praise, I found "Kadosh" too Nadosh (in Hebrew for "trivial ").
