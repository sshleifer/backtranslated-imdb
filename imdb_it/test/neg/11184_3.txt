The price of a dream - and some dreams can be "too" expensive. <br /> <br /> Only having seen the translated version in English is perhaps the reason for a low rating by this viewer. <br /> <br /> It made the general film poorer than the story material suggested to ... <br /> <br /> ... and other comments seem to suggest that the subtitled version would have been better. <br /> <br /> But some elements of the plot remained inexplicable, leaving an unfinished feeling. <br /> <br /> Also leave the thought "is there a series to follow?" A pity there was no more (at least at this stage, anyway).
