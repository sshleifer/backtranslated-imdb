This is really abysmal. I have just received a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after hearing positive things, and I have to say that this was so incredibly little fun and bad, that it will leave you numb and disoriented about how this was ever done. /> <br /> I mean, what was it? Is this the typical humor of the 70s? I don't think so. It's just so ugly, and believe me, I don't even mean "so bad it's okay." This is a collection of extremely dismal skits as if you were watching cable TV. Sure, it was an HBO program, and to think that this may have been considered pioneering is scary. <br /> <br /> There's a pretty pretty girl, and there's some old New York Islanders team NHL hockey footage, which is fun to watch even though I'm a NY Rangers fan throughout the life. But they also ruin it, as they try to take some humor from two hockey players who fight in the ice as if they were "dancing" and, worse yet, upset the videotape of two struggling hockey players to make it look like let's have sex. Oh, how funny! With a little cunning, there is an interview with a hockey player named "Chico" who looks like the NY Islander goalkeeper, Chico Resch, but they also do it wearing a Rangers shirt! Well, maybe it was intentional, who knows. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is, "Disco Beaver" is so obviously horrible, so incredibly bad, you'll definitely feel cheated after watching this and losing almost an hour of your life. You may wonder what the producers of this junk might have thought of having something fun here, and you'll also wonder why these skits can't even get close to the worst Saturday Night Night slop. Unbelievable. Simply incredible
