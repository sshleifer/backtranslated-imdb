This season lacked the real confusion, but, as regards the creation of stories to bring us back in the mood, season 6 is without highlights and spontaneity. <br /> <br /> This season lacked his usual Sopranos style, and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in every episode of this season, you probably would have had 6 episodes worth real stories. <br /> <br /> Secondary stories like Pauly's mom, is she or not? he was boring and had no other purpose than to further explore his character. I wanted to see Bobby express his anger more to Pauly in that carnival episode, but without success. <br /> <br /> And that's it! These side stories had no real purpose and lacked finish. If these stories end up in the next 6 episodes, I'd rather not watch it, because it's not worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Disappointing is a nice word to say about this season and its ending.
