I can see what this movie intended to do. Unfortunately it never completely completes the agreement. The "crime reality" aspect works well and the shots are all top notch. In fact, some scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody way. In particular the silhouette of the detective who talks to the beaten woman, the scene of the investigators crossing the garbage and the father who ties the flies. On some occasions, some scenes get stuck in too many dialogues. Instead of showing the viewer the writer treats him too much like a book. But the real problem lies in the editing. History does not flow. He cannot get a total from the sum of the parts. Eventually you're confused about what's really going on. Those who like this type of detective movie like to follow, putting together the puzzle at the same time that the main characters do it. With such poor editing it is difficult if not impossible to do it.
