This starts off interestingly, as there is a carnival right next to someone's home with an oil rig right there and a kind of church in front of the store across the street with a neon "Jesus Saves" sign, all in a small area ... Now it's pretty dazzling, if unlikely ... and then we get into the movie, which seems unlikely to new levels. Of course this is a limping remake of the 1979 thriller starring Carol Kane as babysitter Jill Johnson ... now Jill is a girl who made her phone minutes work so high that her bad parents are punishing her by making her work, probably something that the public can identify with this film. Jill is taken to this huge and extravagant house on a lake in the middle of nowhere (obviously) by her father to babysit the Mandrakis family. The children are already all crouched in their bed when Jill arrives, and the housekeeper is still there, eh, couldn't she babysit? Obviously, despite the remote position of one of Jill's friends, one with whom he apparently has problems like in "boy theft" or something like that. However, obviously the alarm in the house goes off for no reason and then calls from someone starting to enter, calls from someone who wants to kill her. Clearly, Jill calls the cops and since there's been no real threat to her life, they blow her away, but tell her to call back if there's anything else they can do for her. Watch the scene with Jill calling her friends to the bonfire of the pep high school or whatever it should be, it looks like a "Burning Man" festival, ?? !! ?? There is the whole genre of haters invented in this, including the cute cat Chester who obviously appears here and there, one of the most boring clich√©s of the horrid film there is. I have to admit that I dozed off at some point during this, and I missed something? Hard to say, or worry about it, really. This is one of those films that makes me wonder how badly the remakes of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" could have been. However, from reading online reviews, it seems that the most frightened of these were 12-year-old girls, and I can only assume that statements like "made me pee my pants". Well, one can only hope that this will put an end to the remakes of Hollywood films that weren't exactly stellar to begin with, but don't bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I'm too generous.
