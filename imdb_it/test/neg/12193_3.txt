What could have been an excellent hostage film was totally ruined by what seems to be a bored director ... there were so many directions that the movie could have taken ... a vampire slash-fest was not one Of these !!! The last 45 minutes. it follows that the film is a completely ridiculous waste of time. ... and the sex machine ?? ... you are making a fool of me! The acting talents of characters like Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel (not to mention George Clooney) are completely wasted on this senseless film. <br /> <br /> The director ... Robert Rodriguez, known for his other bloody films including el mariachi, the desperado, once in Mexico, and the very recent city of sin ... really holds your attention with the first half well done ... which leads you to believe that you are in a funny moment ... but then apparently without reason, and without any provocation, madness begins ... there are also weak attempts at parody and comedy. .. really exasperating !!
