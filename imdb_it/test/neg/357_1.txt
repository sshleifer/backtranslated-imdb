I just saw this movie on Bravo! and it was absolutely horrible. It has the plot of a Shannon Tweed film without nudity. The premise was quite interesting, a winning lottery ticket in a secluded area and people who have reasons why they want money. The characters were trivial as were the observations on human nature and greed. <br /> <br /> For a film called Class Warfare, it had very little to do with class differences beyond the first 20 minutes and the predictable final. This film could have done a lot better if there were more characters with reasons to get the ticket and was it a "who did it?" <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't fantastic but it's hard to believe it with such a terrible script. Lindsey McKeon is very pretty and I'd like to see what she could do in a better production with a better script. Probably the only reason I sat through the whole movie. <br /> <br />
