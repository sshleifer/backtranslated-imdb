For years I hesitated to watch this movie. Now, I know why. Not only is it a comedy that can't even be remotely funny, but there's nothing to laugh about * at the movie either. It was even worse than I expected. I rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time rather than money. I've never seen a movie that bothered me so much. It's a film about stupid people who are doing stupid and terrible things. Actually I don't even know how someone with common sense can actually act in this type of film. I've been using IMDb for a while, but I felt compelled to register just to help prevent poor and unaware people from renting or, worse, from buying this stinker !! Really a waste of time and money. I must say that the plot is terrible.
