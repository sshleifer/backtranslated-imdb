From time to time is it highly advised that the aristocracy watch a silent film about the hard life of ordinary people to remember the privileges and the comfortable life they have enjoyed since the beginning of humanity or even before? compared to the complicated and hard work that ordinary people have to endure every day since aristocrats rule the world. <br /> <br /> And that's what happens in "The Love Light", the first film directed by Dame France Marion that will be famous later in the world of silence and talkie, thanks mainly to her work as a screenwriter; better for her, certainly, because her career as a director does not impress this German count. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Dame Angela Carlotti (Dame Mary Pickford) a cheerful Italian girl who lives surrounded by a "picturesque squalor" (an important difference of opinion between upper and lower classes, the aristocrats prefer to live surrounded by "picturesque luxury" ??); she has two brothers and a secret admirer, but all she gives him in return is indifference. Destiny begins to work hard and the war is declared very soon and the two brothers of Dame Angela join in and in the next roll both are dead. But fate is even more cruel and in the meantime Dame Angela falls in love with ?? a German!! And to make things worse, she doesn't know that her Teutonic treasure is a spy and that the light signals she sends to him every night from the lighthouse that she claims to think is a sign of love, do not mean "Ich Liebe Dich" but "Do you sink every damn Italian boat into the sea" ?? <br /> <br /> Fortunately for Dame Angela, very soon her sweet German spy will be found by neighbors in her home where she was hiding him (a strange fact, indeed, because it is not an easy task for a German to pass unnoticed ??) but the German spy will prefer to die before being captured by those Italians. <br /> <br /> From that German love, a half-Teutonic child will be born (the evil Destiny at full speed ??) but a greedy neighbor who has a particular idea of ​​motherhood will take away his child with the consent of a Catholic nun who brought the Council of Trent to extremes? a fact that will put Dame Angela on the brink of madness. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the secret admirer of Dame Angela has returned from the war and one can think that eventually the painful life of Dame Angela will improve; a terrible mistake because Destiny has in store for you that the returned soldier is blind. But as they say in Germany, it could be a blessing in disguise and eventually Dame Angela will recover her son and start a new life with her blind treasure in a poor Italian village in what should be a happy ending for the common people. <br /> <br /> As this German count said earlier, it was much better for Dame Frances Marion who continued her career as a screenwriter, because as can be seen in "The Love Light", she had a lot of imagination to invent incredible stories, ja wohl! ?? but a completely different topic is that of directing films and his silent debut lacks emotion and rhythm despite the effort of Dame Pickford to involve the public with his numerous dishonors. The non-existent narrative of the film provokes indifference in the viewer, making this type of film in which only Dame Pickford itself provides the interest and not its circumstances. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take my leave because this German count must send Morse signals from the castle's north tower to one of his rich Teutonic heirs.
