OK if you're looking for a fun lesbian fun. This is NOT the movie If you are looking for a funny movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the weathervane of "cruel intentions" or "wild things") this is NOT the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian movie. This is NOT the movie. <br /> <br /> However if you are looking to spend an hour of your life, this is your movie. It is poorly written, badly directed, badly marked, badly turned. He had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think you can actually generate the same special effects in imovie lol. <br /> <br /> IT IS REALLY A PRETTY BAD FILM. <br /> <br /> The actors were classic star beauty but they look more like porn stars. it's shot like a soft core porn, but you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored by their brains. the scenes of 'girl on girl', which suck, were so LAME that it is not worth mentioning. go see the "almost sex scenes" on youtube because it's the only reason why you would like to see this movie and even there it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> A DISCOUNT OF MONEY AND TIME !!! don't pick it up, go watch 'Cruel intentions 2' instead - the same movie without the bad special effects, the bad plot, the bad writing, the bad dialogue and bad acting. actually I could go and see it now just to purify myself
