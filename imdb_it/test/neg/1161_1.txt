I did some research on Ed Gien and found some interesting things. Like the fact that Ed Gien, was quiet and a loner, not a little funny as an asshole like in this movie. I will say that I did not finish this film, but I will. I'll make a fool of the fact that all of us, Wisconsin, talk like we're from Kentucy. You know the funny, but really sad factor of this movie, is that Wisconsin isn't as hot as they made it look. <br /> <br /> This film is not just an insult to the people of Wisconsin, being a Wisconsite myself, but it is a complete insult to a man who turned out to be a mad and lonely man. He killed two people and the film didn't even get it right. And he didn't have people so close, personal and scary, he shot only two people, he killed. So why do these films lie and say "BASED ON A TRUE STORY"? This is not based on anything but the lies that the director came up with with his twisted head. <br /> <br /> A joke and nothing more! <br /> <br /> OK, I would like to add to this. I finished this film so sad and I would personally like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when you make a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and oh THERE IS NO DESERT! What the hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous and that had to be filmed in Californa. <br /> <br /> OK, for those who know nothing about Ed Gein, I'd like to give you the history lesson. It was thought that Ed Gein had killed his family, but it was never tried. She killed a bartender, was shot at the nearby bar when no one was around. He took the dead bartender to his house. 10 years later he made SHOT and killed the store clerk, stole the cash register and the store's truck. He was captured because of this murder, he arrived the day before when his son was there and asked for information on antifreeze. The day he killed her, he was in there buying the antifreeze, and the bill that he only had antif ..... was the only proof that they had to start a manhunt all over the world. He robbed the graves, in fact he stole 56 graves. He hates the people he dug and made furinture; lampshades, sofas, chairs and other things. <br /> <br /> He had a family with whom he dined once in a while and threw all the meat he ever gave them when he was captured, considering he was captured at their home. He was arrested and hidden in the back of a police car, for fear of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book that the judge who tried it wrote. <br /> <br /> After this film is finished, after looking at the whole horrible thing, I am not only offended by the horrors of the filmmakers about what Wisconsin women look like. I mean, it was hard to tell who had this guy on the plate for half the time, you know why the women of Wisconsin are all BLONDES. Please! I'm excessively offended by the lack of homework that this guy did and his little work on making this film. I have no idea who this guy Kane is and I think he may be OK in something else, but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all this I'm so sad that I wasted 3.99 in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie after it finished was completely false, this film is like me saying that the world is flat and George Washington was not our first president. Come on, people, this is your story, and this is the story of Wisconsin. To top it off, how would you feel if you made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you might think it's okay, but it wouldn't be true) and lived and wasn't the president and whatever. It is not possible to rewrite the history.
