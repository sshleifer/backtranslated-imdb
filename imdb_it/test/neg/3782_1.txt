This is a VERY bad movie. However, I read that it was done by a high school teacher, so maybe I should give him at least a MINUTE of praise for the ambitious (but terrible) special effects. Here's the plot: a monster emerges from a pile of garbage and pollution in the city of Milpitas, California, and takes on a destructive fury. I'm about to ruin the "big surprise" on how the monster looks, so please read the rest at your own risk. You have been warned! The monster looks like a giant two-legged fly wearing a gas mask. In some scenes, the monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is terrible. The special effects are terrible. The plot is predictable. Stay away!
