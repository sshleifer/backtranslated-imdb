I sat for 2 hours of pure boredom. I look here on IMDB, even though it's not at the top of the list, it's in the top 250. I was a little surprised. Although, yes. I'm very impressed by the acting skills of Robin and Matt, but they haven't saved the film yet. I'm not sure what I didn't like about the movie. Maybe it's because I have math. Maybe they aren't too bad to talk about for 2 hours. Even though I loved "American Beauty", but it was like that. I just want my 2 hours back. It was a big waste of my time. If I miss something in this movie, please send me an e-mail. I'm curious why this is in the top 250. And don't say "Because it was a good movie". <br /> <br /> 2/10
