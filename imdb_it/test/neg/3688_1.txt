This may not be the worst movie ever made, but it is absolutely the most boring. I wonder why it was shot mainly in the dark, and especially with Vincent Gallo walking away from the camera, or looking down? Because he doesn't want to show his face for agreeing to be in this movie. I liked his first things, but the pretentiousness of the "Brown Bunny" and then the cast in this mess put him to rest in my book. And Val Kilmer? Actually, I want to send him a sympathy card. The "doors" to this ??? Actually the casting was the only reason why I watched this movie, and Val doesn't show up until the movie is more than half way. Simply a sad film.
