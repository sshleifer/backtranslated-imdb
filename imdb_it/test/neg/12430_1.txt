** Possible spoilers in advance ** <br /> <br /> Whenever fans of bad movies gather for more than a few minutes, a name that invariably arrives is that of Larry Buchanan. This extraordinary director gave us remakes of other turkeys (ZONTAR THE THING FROM VENUS), cheap criminal dramas like A BULLET FOR PRETTY CHILD, and fantastic conspiracy plots like DOWN ON US and GOODBYE NORMA JEAN. THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a humiliating to say the least. Overlooking the fact that Loch Ness is extremely long and narrow, Larry filmed this howl on a wide, round Californian lake. In the beginning, the film boasts an underwater photography (for the budget) dazzling and creates an atmosphere in spite of itself. Then it degenerates into a windy dialogue pronounced by unnamed actors with falling Scottish accents, not to mention a soundtrack that will do nothing for the very evil bagpipes. At one point, campers sing "Take the high road, I'll take the low road", just to add another Scottish cliché. If the Scots ever decide to jump on the bandwagon of political correctness, they will sue Larry Buchanan for this film, despite his surname. The monster looks like a giant papier-mâché doll and makes the Beanie & Cecil dragon look terrifying by comparison. In an unforgettable scene, Nessie leads to the ground and, to escape from some soldier patrolling, the long fifty-foot-long critique tries to hide behind a tree - and the soldiers don't see it! THE LOCH NESS HORROR is a real boggler that must be seen, several times, to be believed.
