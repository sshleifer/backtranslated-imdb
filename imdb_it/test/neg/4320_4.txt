This film is watchable, but nothing special. Four girls on a trip to Las Vegas foolishly decide to take a hitchhiker (because it's nice). They all end up staying at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the psychotic problems of the hitchhiker with women become evident. <br /> <br /> The characters are clich√©s: there is a married and responsible woman; a slutty party girl; an unstable future bride; and a man-hater who has just been dumped. The hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazy. <br /> <br /> There is not enough blood and too much rape. I really like horror / thriller thrillers, and that didn't do anything for me. The ending was as lame as the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the actors did a great job with what they had to work with. The dialogue is not terrible, and overall I was impressed by the cast, having never seen or heard any of them before. And the plot was not out of the realm of possibility (although I really doubt that a woman these days picks up a hitchhiker - no matter how attractive), so I wasn't complaining that things didn't overall, "The Hitchhiker" was well played and it made sense, but it wasn't very interesting. There are many better films of the same genre that I would recommend about this ("Rest Stop", "The Devil's Rejects", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", also "The Hitcher"). Do yourself a favor and skip it unless you have other options.
