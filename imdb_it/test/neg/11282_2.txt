I leave very few film screenings and this film managed to become one of those that I couldn't bear to look beyond. As for the prizes won, those awarded by Turkish festivals are not credible in my opinion. My only explanation for the Queens Festival award was to think that somehow a comedy layer was "earned in translation" since the subtitles helped divert attention from the horrendous performances. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the screening I attended, the speaker briefly talked about the history of Turkish cinema and at one point mentioned that the first Turkish cinema was rightly called "stage" since many of the directors and actors involved were people from the theater scene. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film falls into that category. English-speaking subtitles might think that Turkish is a naturally strong language and attribute all the cries of the film to this, but observant native commentators will immediately notice that all actors perform with exaggerated voices. This could be attributed to the amateur nature of all the actors, but the biggest source of "shouted dialogue" is the main character, played by the only professional actor in the film. Not by chance his background is in the theater. My hypothesis is that in response to his strong line-up, all the other amateur actors raised their voices, thus transforming the entire film into a series of unnatural performances. <br /> <br /> Put on top of all this a plot that develops at a snail's pace, you get an extremely boring film. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I also have a personal problem with Turkish films that depict an entirely rural life with poorly educated characters. Since "Zugurt Aga", one of the best Turkish films ever made, Turkish filmmakers seem unable to avoid the charm of the rural part of the country. This is interesting only in small doses and if it is beautifully orchestrated with excellent writing and directing as in Zugurt Aga. Very often, however, it is extremely boring and frankly quite embarrassing for the native "urban" Turks. Rural communities are a neglected and uneducated part of the country, and while this provides good material for comedy, it has a huge cost for the image of Turkey. <br /> <br /> A member of the Western public whose only exposure to Turkey is this film will undoubtedly think that Turkey is like Afghanistan. I would like filmmakers to realize this and let go of their passion for "rural man" stories and remain loyal to most of the country, which lives in cities that put the metropolitan areas in Europe to shame.
