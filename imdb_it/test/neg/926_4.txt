Ignoring extreme ratings on "House of Wax", in no way is a "1" or a "10". I will try to help anyone thinking of seeing "House of Wax" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this film very promising, which is what the trailers should do. There is only one thing certain with the trailers, if the producers can't put together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it's almost certain that the film is a great success. But a good trailer just tells you that some things about the movie are good, it doesn't give you much idea of ​​the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. "House of Wax" features the participation of Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than her Canadian colleague Sarah Polley or her double Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist previously known as Jaume , in his first feature film. These are not good signs, but if you are like me ignore them and go see the work of production designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the appearance of "Ghost Ship". Once again, Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it seems that 90% of the film's $ 30 million budget went into production. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate for the abuse he had to make throughout the film (cut fingers, glued, tied lips, and a lot of wading in sticky assorted stuff). By the way, Cuthbert seems noticeably heavier than she is in "The Girl Next Door", about a big pig out of a bigger problem. <br /> <br /> Which means they had little more than to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging by the content of the screen, this could actually be true. It seems that everyone else has given their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy about the unequal pay, the contribution of all these inexperienced / incompetent volunteers is less than zero. <br /> <br /> The inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was as terrible as it probably was to see and work in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert "Pearl Harbor" here) who manage to take most of the added value from the production design group. Rather than pause to show the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and a jerk. Negran aggravated the problem with a crazy number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, a ADD-like camera and a burst are what is used to hide a poor and poor production design; it is not what is needed when the film's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets. <br /> <br /> Chan Hayes did the script and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as a writer although not for the title and the use of wax figures has absolutely no resemblance. One thing that saves is that the film does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (enter "Van Helsing" here). The murders are interpreted for laughter, too extreme to be scary or even terrifying for anyone over six. The audience broke down particularly when a certain high-profile heiress got her familiar face crossed by a steel bar, even though her first half-cooked striptease was the only really creepy thing in the film. Another highlight of the play was when Cuthbert slipped his finger into a grating and cut it from the villain. <br /> <br /> The beautiful scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a wax that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, Siamese twins, and a lot of roadkills (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in) . All this should happen somewhere in the rural areas of Florida, although from the many hills you certainly resemble the country of Paul Hogan (observers of the position of attention: the gulf coast is not known for its undulating terrain). The script apparently thought of reproducing the connection (bad wordplay) between the two groups of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogues related to this have been cropped. Since what's left of the double connection doesn't make sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't even cut to reduce the boredom factor. <br /> <br /> What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize half the production that they had the ingredients for a classic horror of the first order, even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was the possibility of going somewhere with the illusion of a wax city. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is inherently naturalistic, almost without exception, inclined to create an illusion of reality. Here they had an opportunity ready to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the city creates the illusion of reality from a certain distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax construction up close. Obviously they would have had to find a visionary director and a PS to bring it to fruition, but everything else was already in place for this to happen.
