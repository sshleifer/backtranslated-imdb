As you may remember, all three trilogies of garbage seemed to me and the first film is the only one in the distance close to being watchable. The second part was of low grade purification and this installment is slightly better than two, but still a steaming pile of something I removed from my yard last Monday. The premise doesn't make sense, because the moonshiners murdered that poor old lady and even in 1921 I think someone would have noticed a group of anointed boys where a sweet old lady once lived. Second, that the scarecrow is pathetic compared to what appeared interesting in the first film. They are just old clothes and a sack of jute. Let's face it, the series is garbage and should be forgotten. THE CAP!
