SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: The Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Format: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Dolby Stereo SR <br /> <br /> Following a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated "suicides", an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) enlisted the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims are acting on a post-hypnotic suggestion . But their subsequent investigations reveal an even darker force at work, linked to a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life was ruined by sadistic abuse ... <br /> <br /> Based on a novel by Keisuke Matsuoka , this densely the mystery of the pick takes inspiration from a variety of sources (Italian yellow, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), although some of the pictures in the showdown reveal a more immediate influence: the recent commercial success of Hideo Nakata's RING (1998). Despite all his ambition, however, SAIMIN is a routine boycott who stumbles seriously after opening a power plant (the "suicides" are particularly impressive, despite some weak CGI effects), although the director Masayuki Ochiai - who has co -scropped the script with Yasushi Fukuda - rallies for a prolonged finale in which the surprising secrets of the narrative are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for his film adaptation of PARASITE EVE (1997) - which also starred Inagaki (a member of the Japanese pop group SMAP) - and while SAIMIN echoes the film's strong visual sense, it falls Insomma, drama, and most of the characters are simple figures, undermining the emotional payoff of the plot. Which is a pity, because the last half hour is galvanized by a series of dynamic elements - especially a concert hall sequence in which Dvorak's "New World" symphony turns into a murder tool! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are attracted by the promise of a cruel carnage can be disappointed: the film is long atmospheres and short of splatter. <br /> <br /> The performances are varied, due to the limitations of the script, but Kanno (TOMIE) is exceptional as a young woman who suffers from a multiple personality disorder - which, the subtitles on the press in question assure us , is not recognized as a viable medical condition in Japan! - who falls prey to a squalid television hypnotist (Takeshi Masu), a prime suspect in the murders. Inagaki is bland in a one-dimensional role, and is constantly overshadowed by Utsui, a veteran whose career dates back to the "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> (Japanese dialogues)
