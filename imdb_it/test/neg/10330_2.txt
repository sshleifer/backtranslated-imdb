Sandra Bullock is my favorite actress ..... But this movie was so horrible, I couldn't help but giggle over the incredulous movie that I was watching something so lousy. Ha ha. The audio editing is horrible, they try too hard to create creative camera angles. Because they're just weird and stupid. The script was sucked out. Acting was horrible, the plot was not very good. Very unrealistic, even for a movie. But it's a 20 year old film ..... so I'll give you a bonus point for that. And yes, the music was terrible. But we all have to start somewhere. And presenting these things is a nuisance ..... 10 line minimum ... annoyance. Well, now I know why I couldn't find this movie in the movie store .... I had to buy it offline to see it ... good thing it was only $ .58 cents .... even if the shipping was $ 2.59 . Oh well ... I don't recommend anyone wasting time and money seeing this movie ...
