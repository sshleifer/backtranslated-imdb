Although I could summarize this pathetic episode of the night gallery in two words, these two words are "horse manure", I am obliged to write at least ten lines. This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of Rod Serling's standards, but rather an inept attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. The premise of the giant rodents that inhabit the moon, a lifeless sphere to be sure, is totally ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we must also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a filler to supplant the other two episodes broadcast for the first time on that date. All in all, a waste of movies, actors and broadcast time.
