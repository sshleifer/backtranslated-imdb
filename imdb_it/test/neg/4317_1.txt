This film was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The suspense created disappeared due to horrible acting or lack of direction on the part of the director .. I don't know .. it was like a tasty chewing gum that seemed to have no more taste but you keep chewing it because it once had an exceptional taste. Like most thrillers, the Hitchhiker had still promised not to deliver when it had bright eyes and was ready to turn down the volume (I was watching the movie alone ... in the dark) This so-called thriller simply parted as if it were made of Lego turning into something else. He simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a TV-style movie with one exception. Probably it was classified as "R".
