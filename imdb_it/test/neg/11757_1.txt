Yes why? Among the directors released in the 80s and 90s Gus Van Sant is one of my idols. There are others, few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, exasperating sometimes, but coherent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the TV, go to a video store or even buy a ticket and go to a movie theater. However, Van Sant's "Psycho" makes me think. Why? I wonder. A massacre fired by one of the classic perennials. The color was jarring, the exhibits atrocious. What was Vince Vaughn doing? Was it a parody? A bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who dressed her? Viggo Mortensen in a cowboy hat. Viggo is an exceptional actor but in this case he couldn't make us forget John Gavin and if Julianne Moore had been introduced to the world through this performance there would have been no "Le Ore" for her, "Il Minuto" maybe. So here I am, speaking ill of one of my idols. The question that remains is: why, Mr. Van Sant? Perhaps, in the words of President Clinton, why he could. I'm afraid there's no excuse.
