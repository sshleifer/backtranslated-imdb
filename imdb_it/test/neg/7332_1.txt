This guy is a real piece of work. An angry and immature boy in the body of an adult man, who fills all the charisma of a rock, turns around to places that most people would like to visit and does his best to be as miserable as possible. <br /> <br /> Offer this job to someone else who really appreciates it. <br /> <br /> I could write an endless list of all the stupid things that this guy does in his "episodes", even if I will highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals are organizing picnics on the sea in his "honor", this clown has the guts to behave like a petulant and spoiled child. He complains about everything, including the fashion sense of the people who live there. What a fool. <br /> <br /> When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes feigning disbelief to a group of chefs (who probably had better things to do than talking to an American idiot, like work) because they didn't think Abba was horrible . Wherever he went, he raised Abba. This is the kind of talk you'll hear from 13-year-olds who watch too much MTV. <br /> <br /> When he was in New Orleans, he got angry because a certain restaurant had more tasty fries than his, so "accidentally" he poured wine on them to ruin them. What a strange emotionally unstable person. <br /> <br /> The worst of it all is its clumsy dubbing, where it tries in vain to add some sort of perspective on a situation that was too thick and ignorant to appreciate. Try to use all these "big" words to look like an author, but in reality it is just a pretentious hack whose lack of awareness has convinced him that he has something to say. By the way, this is probably the only positive thing about this joker's TV show. It will show you, no matter how inept you are, as long as you take yourself seriously, so will the world. <br /> <br /> Then there's the way he talks to local guides whose English is obviously only rudimentary. Any writer will use the vocabulary - as he believes himself to be - instinctively he will most likely know it will not be understood by these people. Does it matter to him? No. Self-understanding fools like this clown Bourdain do not use language to communicate; they use it to make themselves important. <br /> <br /> Mcg13jthm's review on this same page is a perfect example of the kind of mind that attracts Bourdain, that of a low-IQ social misfit. Notice how the reviewer attempts to justify Bourdain's sociopathic nature with childish simple-minded excuses that make no sense. "Bourdain could complain, but he went through 'a lot' and, not only, he was 'forced' to do this show but he is trying to redeem himself." A dolt attracts the dolts and reading the review of Mcg13jthm should let you know perfectly if you are not the kind of person who would like this show absolutely useless and useless. <br /> <br /> Finally, to add some "fairness" to my diatribe, I admit that Bourdain would have been momentarily funny if I had met him in a bar. But as a television host of a travel show whose aim is to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable, abject, desperate, sad and depressing failure. <br /> <br /> A failure.
