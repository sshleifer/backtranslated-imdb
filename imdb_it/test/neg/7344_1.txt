Were the cast and crew drugged before shooting began? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could fill it. From the first scene where the co-star is late for dinner, was there any doubt about where he was and what he had just done? The suspense was over from there. Now it would take another 85 minutes before the mystery was solved. I must confess that the biggest hole in the plot kept me awake for hours, wondering how stupid the writer, the director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea couldn't at least explain how our killer, who wasn't a lawyer, policeman, could go to a cell locked in a prison, kill his second victim and tie him from a noose to make suicide seem like ??? I kept wondering if I had fallen asleep out of pure boredom and hadn't realized what had happened. If anyone can explain it to me, please do it ... and then, why, for God's sake, did you kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... yet, someone thought that this film was worthy of being an official selection in a film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I couldn't laugh.
