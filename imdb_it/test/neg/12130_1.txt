This film was pure genius. John Waters is brilliant. It's hilarious and I'm not tired of it even after seeing it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. The acting is great, although Ricki Lake could have been better. And Johnny Depp is magnificent. He is such a handsome man and a very talented actor. And seeing most of Johnny's films, this is probably my favorite. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent it today!
