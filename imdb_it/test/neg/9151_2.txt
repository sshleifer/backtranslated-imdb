I just saw a terrible movie called The Sleeping Dictionary. A reviewer of Four Word Film Review (www.fwfr.com) understood correctly when he wrote "From A to Zzzzzzzzz". The story is about an English colonial asshole who comes to Malaysia to "civilize the savages" so to speak and ends up falling in love with his sleeping dictionary. A sleeping dictionary is a fluent native English Malaysian prostitute who supplies the British colonialists and teaches them her mother tongue in exchange for ... well, the film never really clarifies it, but I can only assume that it gives her money or something gender. Needless to say, the film focuses much more on the "sleeping" part than on the "dictionary" part of the job description. Things get complicated for our young hero when the forbidden love story is aggravated by his culture, his domestic soap opera situation and his boundless stupidity in every important decision he makes throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So yes, the film has some major flaws, but on the other hand, it delivered exactly the two things I rented it for in the first place: a beautifully photographed exotic location, and a woman still more beautiful photographed and exotic that plays the sleep dictionary, Jessica Alba. My friend told me that this lousy movie was her the most beautiful and damn it was right. She is not a great actress, and she is not entirely rude, and it is quite obvious that they use a double of the body for nudity, but who cares? Jessica Alba has a rare face and figure that is more than sexy, but also beautiful in the way that a Vivaldi Concerto violin or a Rembrandt painting is. <br /> <br /> (PS We apologize for all the feminists who discourage objectifying women, the "male gaze", etc. etc., but I hope you can understand that I do not want to lack respect.)
