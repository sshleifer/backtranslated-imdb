This film had all the ingredients of a good adventure movie, but revealed incompetence at almost every level. <br /> <br /> The presence of Roger Moore on the cast list is usually a sign that the film will not be something more than mediocre, because Moore always has leading roles and cannot act. But Ian Holm and Lee Marvin were also in this film, and it was based on a book by Wilbur Smith, so I thought I'd give it a chance when I saw the DVD for sale in the business basket ... <br /> br /> It was a mistake. The opening scene seemed to start in the middle of a reel, with the sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been truncated. The scene showed a battleship at sea with a German crew. This bad editing was a sign of things to come, but the scene with the dreadnought was interesting enough to watch. The special effects were good, and the crew wore the appropriate uniforms and spoke in German, indicating that the director paid attention to at least the historical details. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> So I kept watching, and then Moore appeared and my suspicions were confirmed. Bad acting, cliché jokes, cliché cinematography and poor humor ... but, worse still, there is a disastrous attempt to merge the carefree feeling of the film with drama and tragedy. It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Does the film end so suddenly and as badly as it started? in the middle of a coil.
