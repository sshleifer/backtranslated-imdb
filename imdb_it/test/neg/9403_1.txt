This is by far probably the worst movie in which Al Pacino could have acted. The film had no plot. It is a kind of careening in 24 different directions. It seems that the target audience for this film are people from the anonymous gambler. Mcconaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacino's protégé. "So he won some bets for some degenerate customers as a secondary activity in a shitty job that he recorded on a 900 service. This should automatically convince an audience of his abilities? just stupid to think about it, the trailer has promised to show us how it makes its safe choices, but after going through the whole movie I haven't yet seen what skill it has ever had. Now that it's a show. At some point in the movie, Mat's character chooses his winning bets with a coin toss. Someone might do it. Al Pacino seems to be talking a lot and I mean the blabber in your mouth in your dialog box. I think the style started with Scent of a Woman and worked for him because he eventually won an Oscar, but now I think it's just annoying. He always seems to be sermonizing. He makes a petty act of portraying a man with unstable angina (which is an attack of imminent heart) that generally recalls his acting in Godather part 3 that interprets aging, diabetic mafia don corleone but apart from the fact that the talent of Pacino is wasted on this film. Rene Russo is simply an eye candy for this film. She is kept in shape and shows her with the tight clothes she wears all the time. This movie is lousy. Don't waste your money on it. It is much worse than the game choices of the character of Mats in the film.
