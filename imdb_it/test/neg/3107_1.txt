Don't rent this movie. I ended up buying the "previously seen" tape of this for $ 4.00. It was close to the price of a rent, so I thought I could also buy it. I'm throwing it out after finishing this review. The film that reads Lowe is a music video with a few lines of dialogue, slow shots and poorly done editing. I thought I would see a meaningless action movie, which is what I wanted to see, I didn't even understand it. This film is an exercise in slow strokes, without a script, close-ups, a terrible montage and an underdeveloped plot. I can't believe it actually ends with a scene where they think the audience cares about the characters. At the end of the film, we still don't know who they really are. Believe me, stay away.
