Surely I expected more after seeing the cast list, but WOW! <br /> <br /> I think a director at the first opportunity could have done a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler made it, embarrasses me to no end. Somehow, the budget allowed them to secure a group of D-List actors, who managed to embarrass for an hour and a half. The unknown actors were simply horrible, except Steve Wastell who does a decent job as Axl. The story is so ugly, it needs no mention. The overall value of the production seems standard, with some above-average photographic work, if you can overcome the "slo-mo" scenes of God-Awful and the painful "burning person" sequences. I knew it would be stupid, I had no idea how stupid, and unfortunately it is the time that can never be returned to me. I suppose if you like really bad "B" movies, this might work for you, but if you appreciate any story, this is simply terrifying ... A complete waste of time.
