Okay ... for the most part, and all his generosity, this movie was actually pretty good for an MST3K movie ... but then they decided to ruin what little goodness he had about fifteen minutes before the finale. * SPOILER ALERT * The film is very simple ... a rich mom boy named Danny meets a tramp named Bix, and the two of them travel to a small town, where Bix meets a beautiful girl named Carrie (which is so much ). Now, the basic premise of this film seemed quite promising. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any love film ... Carrie adores Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a creepy boy in the city desires for Carrie ... Now I know what you're thinking. .. Bix fights the creep and finally decides to settle with Carrie, and Danny returns home, and they all live happily ever after ... right? MISTAKEN!! Because Carrie is killed by the creep of the city, because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual nuances between Danny and Bix.) And then, the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even if the creep of the city would easily have been the first suspect. Then, the town insinuates confessing to having killed Carrie without much hesitation ... (He must have felt bad, the poor stuff.) Then, Danny brings Bix home with him ... this is the film "always happy and happy". Sad, eh? All I can say is, thank God for Joel and the Bots. Because they turned this hockey horse into one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
