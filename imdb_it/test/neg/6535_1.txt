IMDb lists this film as a comedy. I have no idea which genre falls in this film, but it certainly isn't comedy. perhaps the tragedy. <br /> <br /> I will not say if this is a good movie or not. All I know is that it's not a comedy. I wanted a laugh tonight and what I got was a strange idea of ​​someone's attachment to a bad chair. <br /> <br /> This film is not what is advertised. It's a film school tripe that I can only assume is meant to "make people think". I would not recommend this film to anyone I know, or even to what I don't know. It's a ridiculous thing that makes absolutely no sense. <br /> <br /> It made me think well. It made me think, "I wish I had those ninety minutes of my life back." I'm sure the world is full of chair critics who have a liberal view of their worldview that will make this film worth watching. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of them.
