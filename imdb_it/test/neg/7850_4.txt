The Kissing Bandit was the third and final film by Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson co-starring with MGM. The first two were Anchors Aweigh and it happened in Brooklyn. And in both Sinatra they courted and lost Grayson. I imagine the third time is the charm. <br /> <br /> For romance perhaps, but certainly not for the screen image. Sinatra in his forty films, once again plays the nice little schnook only this time in bullfighter pants. Poaching on the territory of Tyrone Power exhibited in The Mark of Zorro, Sinatra plays the son of a man who owned a hotel by day and The Kissing Bandit by night. He left and left California for an education and returned ready to take the place of dad, but only in the hotel industry. And where he learns the hotel business, in Boston. <br /> <br /> Of course, some of the former members of the Dad band, who grew up a little old and bulging, led by J. Carrol Naish, want me to lead the band again. But Frank is not left out for the life of an outlaw. But it makes a good impression on the governor's daughter, Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> Someone must have done it for Sinatra at MGM to let him in after the bad reviews he had at Miracle of the Bells. Frank is in a better position for Red Skelton. But since this was a musical, I guess MGM's brain trust imagined Kathryn Grayson must have a co-star. <br /> <br /> Actually the best number in the film is for her, Love Is Where You Find It. Ricardo Montalban, Ann Miller and Cyd Charisse also do a dance specialty that is pretty. Frank's songs are beautiful, but nothing spectacular. <br /> <br /> In later years, Sinatra would stop talking about The Kissing Bandit and for good reason.
