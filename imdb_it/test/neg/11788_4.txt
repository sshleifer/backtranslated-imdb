It is difficult to find enthusiasm for this terrible epic of cartoons which for some reason has become a cult classic. Certainly it cannot be due to the totally artificial appearance of the set designers or the clear acting of a cast of stars. These days it is shown too often on Fox Movie Channel or AMC. <br /> <br /> I am sorry to report that veteran actors like Walter Pigeon and Joan Fontaine are also expressed in this confusing science fiction parody, none of which sounds real. It's like looking at an expensive budget that is spent on a Saturday afternoon show full of cartoon characters and unconvincing dialogue. It's a comic version of the novel by Jules Verne. <br /> <br /> Fontaine's aging was still attractive but brings a painful expression to his face, perhaps regretting having accepted the psychiatrist's role before reading the script. It does not contribute absolutely to its cardboard role, but to an imperial and uncomfortable presence and most of the time it seems totally out of place. There is nothing better than Robert Sterling, Barbara Eden and, above all, Peter Lorre, as well as Frankie Avalon, who will sing the title song that, one can say, has not become the melody of anyone's favorite title. <br /> <br /> A terribly frustrating experience to sit in a film like this that wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence. Totally unconvincing from beginning to end. The film, like the fantastic submarine, sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a sad conclusion.
