This film begins with a man who seems to be a sort of sports driver. He meets with a band that contains an arrogant boss, an obvious idiot, a fat boy who never talks, and a woman who turns between them three. The group called Satan's Angels, wants Rod, the driver, as their personal driver. He says no but then says yes, after the authorities have made him a spy to check them. They steal a weapon shop in an absurdly missing plot scene. The scene involves the woman entering the shop with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses. He says he wants protection and wants the shopkeeper to load the gun to show her how. Then he takes it from the shopkeeper and shoots it. The other three in the band (excluding Rod) enter the shop. They take everything from the walls and then proceed to play with it like children receiving their toys on Christmas day. <br /> <br /> This film certainly does not waste precious time on the screen with a plot.
