Actually, I couldn't wait to see this movie. The ads have made him very nice and full of action. And I heard that the character of Claire Daines was arrested for assault, so I thought maybe she'd kick a lot of ass and it would have been nice. BUT NOOOOOOOO !!. Theirs was almost no action and the character was all a bit bland. The only thing he saved was Omar Epps and he didn't help much with this film either.
