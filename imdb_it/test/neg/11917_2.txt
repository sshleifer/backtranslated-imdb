It doesn't really deserve a review, but I suppose it's my duty to warn you of everyone, especially because there are some good reviews of this Canadian floating bomb out there ... Bad acting and a slow, utterly excruciatingly boring 'coming of age' story in which 3 boys live are upset when a fleeing man shows up in their clubhouse in the woods. At one point the boys manage to get away with the intruder and at some point they even see it as a sort of role model ... However, all this changes ... and you don't care yet. You'll recognize Chris Penn, whose greatest cinematic impact is Corky Romano, and a young Devon Sawa, whose career has reached its highest level in "Casper". I was hoping for a '12 and in Holding ', in' The War 'or in' Lie 'and all I got was a waste of time. This film strives to keep the attention of the public and never has an impact or keeps a note of something remotely interesting.
