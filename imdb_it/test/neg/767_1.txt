Although it is considered a cartoon of Tom and Jerry, this is not the cat and mouse team, but a previous Mutt-and-Jeff scam that leads them to go to Africa and disguise themselves as a stereotypical burnt cork trick to try to camouflage. While dialectal humor is mostly lame, there is a short musical sequence that involves "black skeletons" which was fun. I have to ask anyway, how come Tom and Jerry still have the trick to stay on even after being thrown into the water a couple of times? One of the many rumors produced by Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO entered into an agreement with Disney. It is worth seeing only if you are a fan of animation or are interested in how certain ethnic groups have been stereotyped as entertainment when.
