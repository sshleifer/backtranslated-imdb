My summary refers to the fact that this film has 1479 votes - only 21 less than making it eligible for inclusion in the infamous IMDb Bottom 100 list: the 100 films with the lowest score on the site. With a paltry score of only 1.8, this would place the film approximately between 38 and 46 on the list - it's about a very dubious result !! My score of 3 is not so bad - but it brings the movie much closer to the dreaded list. <br /> <br /> As for the film, he sees the very pretty Aaron Carter - yet another once-forgotten and forgettable pop star of the 90s. When he first came on the scene, he was a nice guy with some pre-teen songs and tweeners on Radio Disney. His songs, his appearance and his image were scrupulously cared for and created by marketing people and they did the trick, leading to some huge album sales. Unfortunately, by 2005, sales were falling and Carter had reached his embarrassing stage in life - something that ALL children of his age face. To put it plainly, it is no longer cute in this film and is in a very difficult phase of life. I assume he is now a wonderful young man ... but in "Popstar" he is no longer the heartbreaker he once was. Here, it's just very normal ... a death sentence for a child in his "sensational" position. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note that the film has some appearances by other former admirers of the last decades - including a role for David Cassidy and Leif Garrett - two guys who also know what it means to disappear from the lights of the limelight. Cassidy managed to collect the pieces and make a niche for himself, while Garrett is a great example of a pop star whose life after the celebrity was a bit of a joke. I hope that Carter will come after Cassidy in the future and so far, fortunately, he has managed to avoid negative publicity and the appearance in court of many former pop idols. I was far from thrilled by the film, but I wish him the very best in this department. It's not his fault that he was plastered through radio and television in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> In this film, Carter doesn't really need to stretch: he plays a pop star. However, despite having made millions and been adored by girls, he doesn't have "everything". It is quite dense, especially because it has little interest in learning. The problem is so serious that his mother decides not to attend school anymore - forcing him to attend public school. The problem, however, is that it is rather phobic about taking tests ... and making school voting difficult. So, he has the idea of ​​finding an intelligent girl to date - one who would naturally be forced to help him at school. He takes the pretty but lively Jane (Alana Austin) and pretends to like him very much in the sad attempt to make this scheme work. <br /> <br /> This plot, by the way, is not bad and could also work even if it looks very similar to an episode of a show like "The Brady Bunch" or a Nickelodeon sitcom. Of course, it is predictable and you know that the formula will mean that in the end he will learn his plot and he will get hurt And in the end he will realize that he really cares for him And at the end of the film, everything will be forgiven and they be a real couple. But given good acting and competent management, this could be worth being seen by his teenage fans, as predictable is not always bad. And, as it turned out, this is NOT exactly where the plot went ... but it was terribly close. <br /> <br /> There are some positive things that I liked about the movie. Seeing Tom Bosley and Stella Stevens play Jane's grandparents was very nice - their role was pretty sweet and it was good to see them again. In the film, TV movie star Andrew Stevens also appeared in the 1970s - it was good to see him again - even if a part of me hated him, since he's so beautiful after all these years and I've always seen my 45 years ! He did a great job and it was good to see him in the same film as his mother (Stella). <br /> <br /> As for Carter, with his many previous experiences on TV, it was, not surprisingly, quite good. While his relationship with Jane didn't seem very credible, he and Mrs. Austin gave their best. The film was not great, but they tried and I think most of the problems with the film were in writing - with a better and less formidable plot, it could have worked much better. Furthermore, the whole angle of "testophobia" seemed rather elaborate ... and rather insignificant. Who cares if a mega-millionaire star gets anxious while doing school tests ?! Overall, it is not a rotten movie as the current evaluation would imply, although there is not much here to attract a large audience. People who grew up loving Carter will probably like the movie. Older people will probably care less about young people who probably haven't heard of him. For them, there is no nostalgia value in the film. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie ... Leif Garrett giving advice to Aaron. I seemed to scream "don't listen !!" but no!
