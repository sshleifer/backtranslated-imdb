The first thing that struck me about this film was the terrible acting. The entire cast was so uniformly inept in delivering their lines that I started laughing at the horrible dialog box in the middle of the movie. An even bigger problem with this film is that at no time do we ever find out what motivates the actions of each character. The somewhat salvific aspect of the film is the innovative visual effect of Halfdan Hussey. However, as captivating as they may be, they do little to make up for the imperfections mentioned above. A terrible script mixed with acting at a community theatrical level does not make the vision pleasant. I was genuinely shocked at how bad this movie was.
