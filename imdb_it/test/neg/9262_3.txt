Extremely slow movie. There are excellent performances by all the actors, which is why above 5 points. Surya and Jyo should be this ideal husband and wife and shown to us until we get to a point where you start asking history. one day Jyo discovers Surya's diary to find his failed college romance. The college romance is totally unconvincing since Surya is an arrogant elder who always chooses Bhoomika, beats her friend, screams in public and despite being terrified by him falls in love with him. After that it continues to dominate it using crude language. I could hardly appreciate the mild character played by Bhoomika, I don't think any self-respecting woman will fall for such cretins in real life. So Jyo decides to reunite them and what happens next is the climax. The story is extremely weak in his characters. An extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is the exact opposite of Jyo (and there is no reason for the sudden change of character). An extremely gentle Bhoomika becomes a great extrovert when he returns. if she had become so super confident because she didn't try to find her love because she no longer feared anyone.
