This film tells the complicated friendship, romance and deception between two men and two women during World War II. <br /> <br /> A great effort has been made to make "The Edge of Love" the right time. However, I find this effort too excessive, especially in terms of color tone. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much that it has a strong bluish tone. It is difficult to distinguish who is who in this tone. <br /> <br /> Another negative point is the elaborate use of lenses to take pictures. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, like three smiling faces of Keira Knightley or four pairs of arms in embrace. This simply makes the film confused and difficult to follow, instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> As for the plot, it's simply boring. The way the plot unfolds is not at all engaging. The unstable character of Sienna Miller is annoying. Actually all the main characters are annoying and unlikely. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, which makes it an additional obstacle to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend avoiding "The Edge of Love", unless you watch a movie just to enjoy great costumes, beautiful sets and lighting.
