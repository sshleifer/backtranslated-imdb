One minute in THE UNTOLD and he has already been swiped techniques by THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR. Does this mean we will see many trees? We will certainly do it. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder who blows things up? Well, this film has the budget of a TVM so the answer is a resounding no. Does anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Well because there is a scene in this that looks like this kind of shows. Unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen goes black during a TVM? Great because this happens between every scene in THE UNTOLD. In fact, it also happens in every scene. Did you like MILIONAIRE - A GREAT FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded major Charles Ingram, the competitor who tried to cheat the show of a million pounds. Seriously one of the characters seems to be Major Ingram. I kept waiting for him to say "It's a bear, it could be a bear, but it could be a bigfoot <Cough, cough>, yes it's a bigfoot <Cough>, it's definitely a bigfoot <Cough> Yes I I'm going to take it back. Final answer Chris "<br /> <br /> Oh and did I mention that all of the above are the beautiful pieces? <br /> <br /> THE UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I have ever seen, this recognition definitely goes to NIGHT OF THE DEMON I saw over twenty years ago and I think I only saw less than a dozen films which are worse in all that time. But this said that THE UNTOLD is still a very poor film in almost every aspect, especially editing. As some other reviewers have pointed out, it seems that entire fragments of the film are missing, while there are other fragments in which the scenes are joined in the wrong order. This is a really bad film that deserves much less than its 5.1 rating. I give it 3 out of ten and I am very kind
