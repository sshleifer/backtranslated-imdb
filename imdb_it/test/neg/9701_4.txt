I would like to start by saying that I love the book and I love the A & E miniseries. I was hoping to love this film, and I was absolutely willing to grant him a moderate degree of artistic license in interpreting and shortening the actual story. However, this film barely resembles the original book. If only "the names had been changed to protect the innocent", I would probably have liked the film simply as a hilarious, if not accurate period piece. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, putting the name "Mr. Darcy" on a character who is emotional and weak, giving the name "Elizabeth Bennett" to a reckless, snippy hoyden, often with tears in his eyes, which he does not worries about the rules of society, and makes "Mr. Bingley" a dimwit with wide eyes absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read the original story of Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> There are some really stellar moments in this movie - maybe a total of 10 minutes are really excellent. Charlotte's explanation of why she accepted Mr. Collins's proposal starts beautifully. He is 27 years old (quite close to the age of the spinster without hope in those times), he is becoming a burden for his family and is not romantic. He just wants "a comfortable home". However, the nice dialogue is ruined when you blubbers, "Don't judge me, Elizabeth. Don't you dare judge me!" and run away in tears. Later, see Charlotte going to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who was not at all in her character as described in the book. <br /> <br /> Another good time is when Darcy captures Elizabeth in her home while on tour with her aunt and uncle. It was well done in the A & E series, but the film version with Keira Knightley made the audience feel deeply how humiliating this moment was for Elizabeth. Very beautiful. <br /> <br /> The finale also illustrated a level of affection between Elizabeth and Darcy that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries. I really enjoyed this scene, simply because I like to see a happy ending, rather than knowing what happened. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, this film eliminated the subtlety that was such an important part of Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The characters speak in a strident combination of Austen's verbal dialogue and modern colloquial phrases and expressions. The information that was only hinted at or suggested in the original work is explicitly stated in this version. Yes, time was a problem. It's just a short film, yada yada. But turning a complex and beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Some have commented that they loved the moment when Darcy first saw Elizabeth, because she is so clearly a case of "love at first sight". Love at first sight? Eh? One of the best aspects of the book is that Elizabeth should not be a traditional beauty and Darcy will love her for her spirit and her liveliness ... literally "love her for her mind". <br /> <br /> This version also had a moment (during Darcy's first proposal) when the two were screaming furiously at each other, as they leaned closer ... and closer ... and almost kissed ... but suddenly parted. Ugh! What a sad clich√©. Are they angry and disgusted with each other, but so attracted that it doesn't matter that (at the moment) they don't even love each other? Ridiculous! <br /> <br /> The characterizations were so far removed from those described in the book that it really seemed like a different story. Mr. Bennet was strict, Elizabeth usually played foolishly like her younger sisters, Charlotte was emotional, somehow lacking in intelligence and desperate for a home of her own - unlike the intelligent woman, a little intriguing with an abundance common sense that is portrayed in the novel. The relationship between Jane and Elizabeth is simply topical, instead of the deeply rooted love and admiration they should have for one another. <br /> <br /> All this I could have accepted as merely interpretations of the novel, but I refused to accept all this besides the many, many historical inaccuracies. Miss Bingley was barely dressed (her dress looked like what others wore as undergarments). Elizabeth headed for Netherfield with her hair down and let it all fly. The family stayed in bed one morning, although the mornings had to be reserved for calling acquaintances (or being called home). Elizabeth came out barefoot in her nightgown. And in a truly terrifying scene, Bingley entered Jane's room and conversed with her (and sounded like an idiot) when she felt sick. <br /> <br /> Many believe that these are minor points, but I simply wanted A.) a historically accurate film, or B.) an accurate representation of the characters of the novel. <br /> <br /> The director / writer / anyone has sacrificed accuracy, subtlety and a good story for a trivial love story at first sight. I can admit that those who have not read the book or are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could easily appreciate this film, and there is nothing wrong with that. I simply could not overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than two beautiful faces.
