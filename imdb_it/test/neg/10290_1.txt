I'm not sure who recommended me Surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of the "Fat Guys At the Movies". The person said he was surprised by how big it was and said it was one of the most appealing / disturbing films. (I'm paraphrasing and I do it only by heart, so forgive me if I mentioned it wrongly.) Anyway, I made the decision to watch it. So I take the total blame for my misjudgment in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt that he ever called a "stupid" film but that was the first word that came to my mind about a third and I was impressed until the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Incredible premises and reactions, incredibly cerebral characters (they could blame the writing or the actors, or I'll blame both) and a hugely negative acting. I would prefer if Bill Pullman were US President rather than an FBI agent here. (Of course, there's a reason for this, and I'll think about it partially.) And finally, if you can't understand the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you must have arrived late at the theater or entered the room to watch it late. Don't worry, they will tell you the "turn" every five minutes. <br /> <br /> There have been some serial killers in the wild in the most depressing city in the county or the world. But there's more to the story! Some stupid and corrupt cops like to turn off the tires for their own fun. Could there possibly be more? Oh, yes, there is a family, well maybe not, but there are four humans, a boy, a girl and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole who sees the dead in the sixth sense. There must be more than what I mentioned! This is what makes a movie interesting! Adding all the subplots that can / cannot be developed is the way to go! Ok, then I'll continue. We have stupid FBI agents that made me laugh. A couple of giggling addicts who are shocked at first by their OD dealer but then resort to robbery. An exceptional policeman, who must have been in search of a comic relief, who always fights with an angry / suspicious cop. And finally, (poor, poor) Michael Ironside, who has not just phoned his performance, has just put a message. <br /> <br /> None of these works. They are all told in various forms of temporal presence or flashbacks, and believe me, you will lose any sense of kindness after the first of many subplots has begun. Furthermore, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I think it mainly refers to the cops, but mainly to the girl who did or didn't just lose her family and who barely blinked. <br /> <br /> This stupid, stupid movie sucks. It is barely bloody how the person who advised him said he was, unless his exposure was limited to the stories of Goosebumps. And what is the title? Surveillance? Ah, I understand; it's because it was used in 1/50 subplots just to film the interviews. Since it is so random, it could also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Stay away from this horrible mess.
