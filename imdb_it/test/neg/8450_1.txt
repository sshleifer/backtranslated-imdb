Like the poster above, I burned myself on the title thinking that I was taking the other Piranha ... This film is all that the above poster said and worse ... <br /> <br /> Poor camera, bad acting and simple horrible plot ... <br /> <br /> There was very little here that was worth watching ... The way this film was released is beyond myself. <br /> <br /> Make sure the movie you buy is what you want ... and not this one. <br /> <br /> The movie I bought was labeled "Piranha" and not "Piranha, Piranha"! which is what it actually is ... This is the only way they sold this film. <br /> <br /> Peace Out.
