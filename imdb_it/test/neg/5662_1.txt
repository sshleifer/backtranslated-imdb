iCarly is about a teenager named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with the artist's brother, Spencer in a Seattle loft. Carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes a lot of money a year, so much money that "she doesn't even know it's a real number". His best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy) which is as predictable as it gets! He says "normal" things and beats Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is responsible for all the technical stuff for their web show. Carly shouts every word and seems to have no emotions. Sam chases Freddie and screams Freddie. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (the doorman) in the elevator and survive. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, unless you like screaming teenagers, hurting people and making fun of things.
