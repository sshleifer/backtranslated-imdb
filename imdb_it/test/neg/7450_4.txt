'Ernest Saves Christmas' is the comedies of Ernest's Christmas movie. In this film, Ernest must find a successor to Santa Claus for Christmas to continue. Along the way, he meets a girl who is a thief and who ends up stealing something very important from Santa Claus (I won't tell you what it is, you'll just have to watch the movie for yourself). Like most of Ernest's films, there is a lot of slapstick humor involved. <br /> <br /> This film is probably one of Ernest's best films. It's fun, and has some important lessons to learn about friendship and family and not being afraid to show love. It's not the best Christmas movie out there, but it's a good way to get yourself into the Christmas spirit. It's a little sad that the film is a little dated now.
