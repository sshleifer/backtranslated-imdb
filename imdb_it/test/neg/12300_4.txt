'The 4th Floor' is a decidedly mediocre film starring Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer with a heck of a near problem. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited a fantastic fifth-floor apartment from her grandmother and, by arrangement with the landlord, gets a ridiculously low rental rate. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a terrifying man of the time) wants her to move in with him, but she wants her space. So she moves, and strange things start happening, and since this is a B-level horror movie, there's a stupid, not-to-be-found-in-reality reason. While Jane, too intriguing, keeps trying to tell others - her boyfriend, the police, her colleagues - what's going on, everyone thinks she's losing. So, of course, he has to face the problem - the fool who lives right below her - alone. Neither scary nor interesting, the only saving grace of the film is Lewis. She is a very beautiful but ill-used actress here, which does not mean that it is not the best thing about this film, because it is. It has a feral charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen silicone bimbos that usually populate this type of film. This type of film, however, is not worthy of her - which is ironic, since it is probably the only reason why someone would see it.
