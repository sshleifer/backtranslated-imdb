Terrible! A friend of mine (who obviously thought he had an abysmal sense of humor) recommended it. <br /> <br /> They are spools. I almost turned it off. It is only my anal desire not to leave unfinished things that have prevented me from doing so. <br /> <br /> This was evidently a British attempt to shoot a film with a group of television actors who used some lame script of their business partner. I find it hard to think of something that comes close to the scarcity of this film. Less fun than global warming. <br /> <br /> Normally I'm not so vehement, but I watched this over ten years ago and thought that I lost an hour or more of my life on it is destructive. <Br /> <br /> Childish, less plot, useless tosh. <br /> <br /> I would rather eat my feet than watch it again.
