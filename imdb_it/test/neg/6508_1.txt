Perhaps it was the excess weight accumulated by Seagal. Or maybe it was the horrible acting of Wayans in an action movie. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two protagonists? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should never have done this acting nightmare. True, the plot was good. However, as an avid follower of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his kind of clean, pure and healthy Zen Buddhist life, particularly in his screen discussions with Wayans. (Again his real "nanny" deal was also inconsistent!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what an action character did in " Kindergarten cover "... put funny material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react comically. Otherwise, leave out the essays and useless attempts at humor while chasing a serial killer. Seagal is not a type of natural humor. It did not work. <br /> <br />
