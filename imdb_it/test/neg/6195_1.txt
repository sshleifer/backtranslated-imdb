Okay, I heard that a Mormon movie about Mormons would be a disaster waiting for Mormons to happen, but I didn't know how painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally beautiful propaganda films. The official Church film campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow" that ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 1970s. Then there is the violent work of Neil LaBute .... <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films depended largely on whether they focused on Mormons or a specific Mormon theology. Instead they choose to focus on a universal theme and address it at a basic human level. "God's Army" abandons every pretext of universality and rushes headlong into the fairy and myopic world of orthodoxy. While this may be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted Mormon, the ineptitude of director Richard Ductcher as a director and his youthful approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge the "Army of God" unwatchable by almost any standard. <br /> <br /> The same acting of Dutcher in wood imposes the tone to his army of the less interesting Mormons you could meet. Obviously the unpleasant interpretations of the cast were not helped by Dutcher's pathetic script. He should have the merit of not evading some of the most controversial aspects of the Church, but, as one might expect, he conveniently frames these polemics in a comprehensive light. Nor should it be surprising that most of the answers to the dark side of the Church are dealt with by little other than faith. At one point, an African American missionary was scolded by a black couple to enter a church that was segregated until 1978 (about ten or twenty years after almost all the congregations in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so) . Instead of addressing the actively racist history of the Church, perhaps the most painful point in Mormon theology that even Church leaders no longer defend, Dutcher's concerned character instead reflects the murder of Joseph Smith - an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Complete this fun sip of milk with the third leprous grader passing through the comic relief and you have a strong argument for the awakening of silent films. <br /> <br /> If you knew little about the Mormons before watching this movie, you could become inclined to avoid them at all costs. If you are a Mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
