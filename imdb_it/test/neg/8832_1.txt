I have seen THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL with the declared object of refuting this so-called scientific atheist. I don't know where to start because it is such a rich source of stupidity. <br /> <br /> Obviously it is not a statistician, otherwise the odds of 2/1 of him burning for eternity would have led him to belief in God <br /> <br /> considers science as a religion and yes wait for us to believe in him as we do God. One only has to look at the language used in his postulations. <br /> <br /> Regarding faith. This product is widely used in everyday behavior. Think about it. When he joins an electrician, he believes it will be wired correctly and will turn on the switch with confidence. When he enters a plumber, he pulls the chain in his bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding belief in science When I was in the chemistry class I believed and was taught that the atom was the smallest particle and the theory of electron peel, both of which have now been taken for granted. I was taught this as an atomic theory "written in stone" so to speak. So why should we believe any scientist, especially when it goes beyond the parameters of his field? Dawkins states that religion will be the ruin of civilization. Religion is civilization. Can he or any other atheist please tell us which civilization was founded and nurtured by atheism, barbarism or ferocity, please? Now he lives in the last stages of a Christian civilization and reaps all the benefits without any admission for his source. I found Dawkins arrogant, dictatorial, judgmental, an obvious believer in eugenics and a Nazi in his attitude to young people. How dare he say what a parent can teach his child. The child is theirs, not that of the nation and as parents leave behind their genetics, so they leave their beliefs as their inheritance. His dismissal of Adam as "never existed" since he has no evidence was an example of this same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he could very well do it. I haven't found the proof yet. This does not deny its existence. I note his argument with the bishop of Oxford that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Well, even Dawkins does it. Where does it draw the line between this as a historical document and a religious declaration? It is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins discovered the ALTRUISTIC gene. What fun. He is desperately looking for evidence for his extravagance and how the Piltdown Man was invented, so now we have this so-called ALTRUISTIC gene that predisposes us to take care of our young people and other members of our 'group'. The problem is that all animals do this - not just monkeys, and with evolution is the survival of the fittest. he is not the kindest and if he really thinks we are becoming kinder as a race is not reading the same newspapers as me, I found his arrogance beyond imagination in declaiming that as we only have this life, we should fully enjoy it. So, how does he compare it to his obvious position as a wealthy European in a poor person in Africa who has made his entire family disappear and probably raped and is starving. Will it help you? I note that all his opposition to religion is a) that they go to war. Well, G K Chesterton declared that the only war worth fighting was a war for religion b) we are against the use of contraception, abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the sixth commandment. Funny. <br /> <br /> As a Catholic, I find his departure from the declaration of Pius XII on the Assumption Dogma in 1958 wrong. He, Pio, never said that he was revealed while sitting somewhere alone . In the event that Dawkins does not know it, the Apocalypse ended with the last Apostle. Pio would take years of advice and study the documents delivered over the centuries for having devised this statement. Even as a Catholic I find his dismissal of all religious people as satisfied. that total nonsense. Every day we fight the world, the flesh and the devil. We are the militant Church. We are also able to glory at sunset and admire the beauties of nature even if we believe in God. The trouble with Dawkins was that he interviewed zealot fanatics and extrapolated them to all of us.
