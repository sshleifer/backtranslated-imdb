After his success with A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided his next project would be this TV movie. I'm not a big fan of this director overall; The last house on the left and his modern Scream slasher fit me well, but the rest of his work is very inconsistent and I would hesitate to call him the teacher that others have labeled him as. The main theme here is cryogenic freezing, although it is more a springboard to the plot rather than an important part of the film. The main influence here is obviously the excellent 1974 zombie movie Deathdream and we focus on Miles Creighton; a businessman cryogenically frozen for ten years before an accident which means he must be defrosted immediately. Miles is a part of a project for sick people; they pay to be frozen in the hope that they can be revived in the future when their illnesses can be cured. Miles is successfully reanimated and seen as a miracle ... but the person who wakes up is not the person who was frozen, as Miles returns without a soul. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been decent enough to judge by the idea behind it, but instead we are given a plot that doesn't have much to do and it must be said that Craven does not make the most of the movie. The "soul" is the main focal point, but it would seem that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intent / no compassion is the same thing, which seems a bit devoid of imagination. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly bad and it is obvious that not much money was spent because the entire production seems very cheap. Michael Beck has never become a very popular actor and it is not surprising to judge by his interpretation here; while it is passable, it largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot doesn't flow too badly, but there is a real lack of suspense and / or tension and things slow down too often, which makes the film rather boring on certain occasions. It all boils down to a predictable ending. Overall, I have to admit that I wasn't at all impressed by this movie and, as far as Craven's filmography is concerned, Chiller should go down with Shocker, sequels to Scream and The Hills Have Eyes II.
