I remember watching this movie on TV a few years ago. It was so bad, I can only remember the scenes that made me laugh. The only summary of the plot that I can give you (without spoiler) is the image of a movie made by college children who were tall. <br /> <br /> (The spoiler warning starts here ...) When the movie starts, a boy running, chased by the "Demon Cop", when in reality the man was really chased by a Halloween costume gone wrong. A car comes out of nowhere, hitting the guy who was running. He sends it flying over it, and what does the driver do ??? He looks at the man as he falls, gets back in the car and runs away. What kind of idiot with hair on his head would do this? I would at least have asked if the boy was okay. <br /> <br /> Then, a black guy looks straight at the Demon Cop in his face, then tells reporters, "I didn't have a good look at him." My sisters and I, at that point, were almost choking to death with laughter. <br /> <br /> Then, there is a scene in an alley, where this girl with an afro pulls out a machine gun from her teenage years. weeny small bag. He couldn't have FIT !! I can barely remember certain scenes. Maybe it's because they were just so bad. <br /> <br /> The cops in the film can't even jump over a fence, and the acting is so wooden, it makes the wooden planks look better actors. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie brings shame to Hollywood, much more than any other flop can do. You have to see it to believe in its mushy texture, which has none, as far as I know.
