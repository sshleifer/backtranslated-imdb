When THE PUFFY CHAIR calls, pay attention to its soft and colorful linings. <br /> <br /> The film starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are a boyfriend-girlfriend couple who have some difficulty with their relationship. A discussion occurs one night and to remedy this, Josh asks Emily to come on a trip to her father's house where Josh plans to deliver a LazyBoy recliner for his father's birthday. Emily accepts and along the way they collect Josh's brother Rhett Wilkins, an Amish-looking guy more in touch with the lives of others than his own. <br /> <br /> The roadtrip quickly turns into more quarrels between Josh and Emily, as well as a bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (initially it is very dirty and is disintegrating until Josh "convinces" the original owner to renew it). Rhett quickly ascertains that the cause of all Emily and Josh's problems is the LazyBoy and takes him to the torch one night ... <br /> <br /> And it is the last time we hear about the chair, even if there many minutes left in the film. <br /> <br /> The big problem is that the title of the film is The Puffy Chair, when it is not at all the chair that takes center stage. It's the condemned relationship of Josh and Emily and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for each other. Once the chair is destroyed, no other one is ever mentioned, even if they come to Josh's parents on his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentions the chair, nor his father. There is no connection between this and the lives of these people. So why call the movie The Puffy Chair and why there is no connection with it in the end? Bad script. <br /> <br /> The other annoying thing is that Mark Duplass's brother, Jay Duplass, is not only the director, but also the cameraman (and not very good). Almost all the scenes have a quick zoom on the characters that become grainy and blurred before the camera's autofocus reaches its rights. Initially this took on a picturesque and artistic appearance, but quickly became unbearable. <br /> <br /> Acting in the film is accessible and fun. All the actors / actresses have done excellent jobs. But the poor quality of production, the forced end and the lack of consistency in the title have caused this film to have too many problems.
