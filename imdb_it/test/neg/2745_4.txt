-SPOILERS ------------ I am a fan of the French cinema of the 60s-70s but not necessarily the most modern, so to be honest I saw it thanks to Bellucci. He is very young here, extremely apparently this film is one in which they met with Cassel, so it gives him a little more importance. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a very beautiful style reminiscent of DePalma. Then suddenly we get flashbacks, and the front and back goes forward which becomes tiring. I don't mind a flashback, but do it and finish it with the man !!! However, the film is still interesting to me to a point where the first and well-defined hole in the plot, which takes into account the rest of the story, never lets me enjoy the rest. I can leave holes here and there, but don't base an entire plot on hot air. This is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame. This is the main plot. I will go on, when the story at one point will convince me that there are really mysterious things going on, but in a story there is nothing really mysterious. Bellucci-Cassel are a couple, so Bellucci must urgently leave for a I work in Italy (not the farthest place in the world from Paris) and she leaves him a message, which for later reasons explained that he doesn't. Yes, so ?, these people don't have phones? Is it supposed to be absent for 2 months (not exactly a century) and would not have called his boyfriend in Paris to see how he was? Of course not. Instead, even when he returns, he forgets all about him. All right, but later in the movie he tells his friend that he was his greatest love and is ready to commit for the first time in his life. she couldn't call him for 2 months and then never tried to go back with him. And what about the Cassel character? He was supposedly unable to locate her in Italy, really hard to find someone in Italy, probably like Siberia, especially an actress who is probably also listed in art newspapers. And after 2 months when she returns, it's really hard to find her and ask for an explanation. It is believed that he wanted to avoid it, but no, we find that they simply could not meet. It is difficult to meet in Paris. OK, I don't need to go any further because this is the whole movie based incident. Worse still, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but this other girl is Bohringer.
