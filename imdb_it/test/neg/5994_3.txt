I like most of Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie from the United States, because in Germany you can't get it anywhere. I thought it would be nice and fun like the Subspecies or the Puppetmaster series, because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was happy when the film finally arrived. <br /> <br /> But after watching this cheese film, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can't even say actors) are boring and without talent. The story was poorly performed and even the set and the monster were very cheap and bad. I hope no one can ever make a sequel or a remake of this terrible movie. :-)
