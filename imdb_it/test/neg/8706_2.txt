With a name like "10 commandments" you would expect a film to be representative of the story in the Bible, especially Exodus. It is not so here. This is a standard procedure with any film made with the Biblical brand. Remember "Noah" ?? It was an absolute fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had "some" truths in the original story. However, Menerith, who was an important character in this film - half brother of Moses, is not in the original story. Other characters were absent, not to mention the important events that had been completely eliminated. So what, could you ask? Because this should be representative of real history; otherwise, some may and believe that it is actually the way it happened. In today's age, people take their religion from movies instead of the Church and read the Bible. Moreover, it is a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script has already been written. Why change it? In addition to the account in Exodus itself (which should be the main objective), you have the Cecil B. DeMille film to compare it, which is clearly a far better presentation. <br /> <br /> The night she was first shown, my wife was anxious to see him. I told her not to let her hope because it was a Hallmark movie. She looked puzzled and said, "Why? Hallmark makes good movies". It could be that way, but they slaughter the Bible. I'm sorry to say I was right. Not just the story, but also the acting. With today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful Bible movie. I'm still waiting...
