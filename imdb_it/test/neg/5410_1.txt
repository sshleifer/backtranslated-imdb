My wife and I enjoy the bad science fiction movies. Some movies are so bad that they are good. Mansquito was one of those. That was bad but had some saving qualities. Makes you think of a respectable actor approaching lines like "Hey! Mansquito!" <br /> <br /> This is so serious that it has now taken its place as our standard for evil. It's not just a bad movie, it really stinks. There was the coed attack force, the "Indian" who rode in a black cloak and used a SWORD to shout loudly. He shot down a helicopter with an arrow !! <br /> <br /> We tried to laugh at this movie, but there were no points where it didn't rise above the pitiful. We could not find any saving function except one. Those were the words "The End" <br /> <br /> There seemed to be no plot, no character development and no point to the film. Someone in Hollywood must be fired.
