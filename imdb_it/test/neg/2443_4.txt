Miserable film Not even to be compared in a breath with "To Kill a Mockingbird" or "In the Heat of the Night". <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a racial bias but the film is ridiculous at best. <br /> <br /> Come on now. Would you really have Elizabeth Patterson, of all people, guarding a prison to avoid a lynching? Patterson, in his time, played the mother of all and was the hostess in "I Love Lucy" before Fred and Ethel Mertz bought the building. <br /> <br /> Imagine exhuming the body so that the man's black pistol didn't kill a white man? <br /> <br /> Claude Jarman Jr., who was fabulous in 1946 "The Yearling" appears in this mess. He still had those sad eyes. Even my eyes would be sad if I appeared in this horrible film. <br /> <br /> For me, this was nothing more than a full-fledged Faulkner flop.
