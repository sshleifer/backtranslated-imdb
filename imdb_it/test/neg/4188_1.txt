My spoiler is in my pants because thinking about this movie made me so angry that I was pampered. <br /> <br /> Once you have finished watching it, stare at the TV in confusion and horror. Then, there is a light touch on your shoulder and a hissing voice: "You will die in seven days". You turn around, and one of your best friends is standing there with a look of absolute hatred for what this movie suggested when you were in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> I will not lie: this is the worst film on the face of the earth. I saw it with 5 of my friends all 18-year-olds, and these were our reactions: -A person actually started crying and punching herself -A person screamed and fainted -A person got up and staggered out the front door to reappear more than an hour later - A person simply obscured (this was me) - A person started babbling incoherently, as if he had both cerebral palsy and Touretts Syndrome - A person entered in a kind of catatonic trance and he hasn't answered our voices for more than twenty minutes <br /> <br /> The film is really so ugly. There is a part where the retarded cameraman actually travels (holding the camera), but the producers have decided to leave him inside. Seriously, it can be heard grunting and cursing when it hits the ground. There is only one special effect, and it is special in the same way that a retarded child trying to solve a Rubix Cube is special: the camera rotates in such a way that the action on the screen (action, n. Some idiot lost in a cornfield for 80 freaking minutes) makes a barrel roll. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances should it be watched, and the movie itself also alerts you to this fact. Do you know what the tagline is on the back? "Some warnings should not be ignored." I honestly think that the release of this film to the public is a sick practical joke from the producers. This does not mean, however, that you should pass it if you see it in a movie store: it would then sit on the shelf to see other poor poor people. Instead, buy every copy of what you can put on your hands and send them to people you hate.
