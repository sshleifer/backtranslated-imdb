I saw this movie and in all honesty I was pretty disappointed. And in my opinion this film is heartless. Frankly, I didn't care what happened to the characters at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were so many things that they could have done with the movie that they didn't do it because they were so enthralled in trying to be obscure and make some profound comments about life, or try so much to, that the characters and the story were completely lost in all of this. I saw another picture of this director and I had a pretty good time. But I felt that this film lacked the whim and heart of the other and I wondered what the point was, or if the point of the film was that it made no sense. Honestly, while I didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the film, I felt remorse for the time lost in the sad film. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but frankly I didn't.
