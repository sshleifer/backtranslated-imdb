The best thing I can say about "Quintetto" is that it's not as bad as I remembered being at my first sight. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's good. <br /> <br /> This strange sci-fi thriller is not exactly like any other film I've ever seen, which, I believe, gives it the brand of newness. But it is a borderline disaster in a movie, and one of the worst Robert Altman ever made. In the special DVD on the creation of "Quintet", it is clear that Altman also did not know what the hell the film should be. <br /> <br /> It is set in a distant future when the world is in the grip of another ice age. The film was shot on the abandoned site of the Montreal Expo '67, and I have to admit that this gives the film some interesting production design elements, although it appears to be largely filmed in a frozen mall. Paul Newman, apparently zonked and utterly uninterested in everything that happens around him, and Brigitte Fossey, play drifters who roam this futuristic city in search of Newman's brother. Soon Newman is involved in a deadly game of "Quintet", which all the bored inhabitants play for lack of something better to do and whose rules are never clarified to the public. All we know is that the goal of the game is to kill everyone else you are playing with and remain the only person alive. This gives these nihilistic inhabitants their only emotion, because as one of them says at one point in a psycho-solilous soliloquy, only to be close to death can one appreciate being alive. <br /> <br /> The film is slow, ugly and actually uncomfortable to watch due to its inexorable sadness. It is almost as if Altman were intentionally intending to make a film that nobody would like to seduce. There are no characters - oh sure, the actors revolve around talking lines, but none of the lines really means much and the impressive list of international actors that Altman has assembled for this register is not a shred. Only Bibi Andersson gives the closest thing to a memorable performance as could be found in a film like this. Nevertheless, he manages to create an atmosphere, even if that atmosphere is purely terrible, and is strangely fascinating in the way that watching a man slowly die of hunger would be fascinating. <br /> <br /> Altman really hit a drought after nearly a decade of superb films. "Quintet" closely followed the atrocious "A Wedding" and was followed in a short time by the not bad but above all forgettable "A Perfect Couple", the "bad news" by all accounts (which I have never seen why not is available nowhere to be seen) and the disastrous "Popeye". Thank God he bounced. <br /> <br /> Vote: D-
