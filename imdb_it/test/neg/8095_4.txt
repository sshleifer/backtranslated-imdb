I mostly rented this movie to see Shannon Elizabeth. He played well in this film, but the plot sucked. The film didn't talk about anything just to try to stay single after making a deal when one of Jerry O'Connell's friends gets married. The other friends put this money together and whoever was the last to get married gets the money ($ 10,000) from all his friends. However, the film tries to keep doing since then, trying to make it more fun and then doing it since then. I'm glad I paid only â‚¬ 50 for this movie. It was not good at all. I rated it **** on 10 stars!
