This film, "Desperate Measures", was .... I'm not quite sure how to put it into words. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I couldn't stop laughing at how absolutely ridiculous it was. I love Michael Keaton and I can't understand he did it. They did a good job of keeping my attention because I couldn't wait to see how much more ridiculous it would be to get minute by minute. Actually, I just registered on this site to find out. I can't review the films. I don't have time for this, but I can't let it go knowing that I did not do my civil duty by letting people (those who have an IQ of 85 and above) know that this is not an action / a thriller, it's honest to funny goodness. You people who really excite me scare me. Go watch a good movie like Million Dollar Baby. Clint Eastwood's acting is not superb, but in the end I was in the balance. Exercise your brain in America!
