I feel really bad about the review of this film because I wish I had only seen it as a conceptual production. The Covenant seemed to be a truly original piece, but unfortunately they lose the great idea in the translation on the screen. <br /> <br /> The story follows four (five) teenagers who are descendants of the families who started the city of Ipswitch, a survivor of the Salem witch trials. Furthermore, they are part of the secret sect called "The Covenant". Their power must be used sparingly as it drains their life force in small amounts and is very addictive. In theory, this would be a pretty good science fiction movie or at least an interesting kid movie. <br /> <br /> But there were too many dazzling falls that do not allow this film to reach the full potential plot. That acting was not good, the soundtrack was mediocre and we encountered many unnecessary synchronization problems. Certainly the biggest problem is poor editing work. The film has little or no coherent flow and makes an effort to maintain a mental timeline or any sense of rhythm. <br /> <br /> The film has its moments, but overall it was a bit disappointing. <br /> <br /> A 4/10 witch
