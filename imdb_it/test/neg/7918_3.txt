If you've just watched All Dogs Go To Heaven and learn that there is a sequel, don't watch it. It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible. They hurry to develop the characters. Sasha, for example, starts singing about how you can count on love. And in the end, this looks more like a dramatic and romantic film than a comedy-adventure film. They tear Charlie away from his character and replace him with a soft, soft, but still rebellious version of himself. <br /> <br /> The humor behind the character of Carface is completely lost. It is a totally different dog. He no longer has a beautiful voice, he is not the evil that you love to hate the most, he is only a wimp dubbed by none other than Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Speaking of voice actors ... <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And even if it's not horrible, I don't like it. It's terrible compared to the excellent work Burt Reynolds has done for the character in the first movie. Dom DeLuise is as wonderful as ever, like Itchy. That character remains true, which is why this film gets a 3/10. Only because Dom DeLuise was still voicing Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know Ann-Marie's film is finished and finished, now she has parents, etc., But has Charlie completely forgotten about her, or what? No mention to EVERYONE of her in the second movie. I mean, even a small mention from Itchy would have been acceptable. (ex. "Charlie, we have to come back. You can't take care of every child that needs to be saved.) Or something like that. I mean, he died living with her, he deserves some kind of mention. Don't look at this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
