This movie is really bad, it's not very well done and it's an attempt to lack lucidity in something, but I'm not sure what. I looked at it and was very disappointed. He promised a lot, but he didn't deliver anything. The characters are shallow and wooden, and the music, if you can call it that, is terrible. There are of course all creatures and animate beings, but they are so badly made that it does not present itself as something other than a third-rate film. It is a pity that we cannot pay more attention to special effects, not to the whole and the end of a film. I agree, but in a film based on them, it's a very important factor. For me, a very sad attempt, and should be avoided.
