I don't think of ruining anyone's experience in this movie by telling you not to see it if you have something better to do, like cleaning under the stove. It gets dirty underneath and you have to clean it a few times. <br /> <br /> I think the film suffers from lack of sex and violence, although there is only one stunt that seems so dangerous that it could only have been shot in a country where life is cheaper than beer. The heart of "Gargoyle" is in the right place, but his aspirations are conservative. It is at least not pretentious. But I had a lot of fun acting, playing the perennial idiot in the horror movie that says "What's at the bottom of this hole?" and dies for his arrogance. I also had the opportunity to meet Michael Pare. Every movie addict should work with a clip of the movie B at least once before death. And the Romanians are the most adorable people I've met. Literally the most beautiful. Walking down the street in Bucharest: if 7 out of 10 women are not absolutely beautiful, you are walking down a road that I have not encountered; and be consoled by the fact that at least 5 of the 10 are available for drinks. <br /> <br /> A part of the film was shot in Casa Radio, an abandoned and unfinished communist classic of the nightmare cum-georgian block originally intended to host KGB propaganda ministries, namely Radio Not- so-Free Europe. The five stories of the building are tall and occupy a block; above all, while its fa√ßade radiates the solidity of the state of the Big Brotheresque, it resides near the city center as a post-apocalyptic ruin in a burdock jungle and a hemp populated by dozens of gypsies and dozens of wild dogs. The construction of Casa Radio was suspended when Caucescu and his wife were executed on TV in 1989, and still there are holes that fall from the scorching upper floor of the sun (which offers surreal views of a modern four hundred meter concrete roof section , decorated with cracking rebar and old car parts, overlooking an ancient ruined city) to the damp and disturbing basement (which doubles in the film for the Gargoyle's den.) No American-style railings or signs of danger for Bucharest. <br /> <br /> Since the demise of the Soviet Union, Casa Radio has hosted several non-union films, including "Highlander III". It is interesting for the producers because it is an economic position, enormous in terms of size and available space, bizarre and lacking in insurance headaches as it is still owned by the state. Furthermore, no one complains if he does not clean up after production: anything left on site is interpolated in the construction of their slum by the Gypsies in this urban jungle. <br /> <br /> An assistant director was bitten in blood by a wild dog during the filming of "Gargoyle". The apples provided by the catering were put into service by the cast and crew as bullets to keep the dogs in search of prey at bay. I too have been bitten by wild dogs in Bucharest, once in a bar (!) And once in a city park. I also survived two car accidents in two weeks, both by taxi and none of which was seen by the drivers involved as a reason to stop the cars. <br /> <br /> NOTE GEEK: The Sci-Fi network or channel or anything else was one of the supporters of this movie (the lower the budget, the more producers are on the set), so it's a bit strange that nobody he had problems with the original title, "Gargoyles", until it was almost time to show it on the net, even if science fiction already had an unrelated set of that name. The title has sometimes been changed relatively close to release, as I have a color corrected copy labeled with the previous title.
