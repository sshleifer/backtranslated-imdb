This must be one of the biggest failures of all time ... the script was nice and could have ended much better. The actors should have sounded better and maybe I would have given this film a slightly better grade. maybe Hollywood should redo this movie with little better actors and better directors for disappointment but the film is bad. <br /> <br /> If I were to see it again it would be like torture. I don't want to ruin everyone's opinion with mine so ... my advice is to watch the movie first ... see if you like it and after voting (don't vote before watching it!) And anyway ... Have fun looking at it ! Don't just peek ... look at it until the end :))))))))) !!
