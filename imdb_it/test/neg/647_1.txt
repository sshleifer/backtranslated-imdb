My wife and I saw this in the theater when it came out. <br /> <br /> There were only 3 couples there and we all went out about the same time. <br /> <br /> This is the only movie I've ever released. <br /> <br /> Sitting down was painful. <br /> <br /> The theater actually stopped us as we went out and asked if we wanted a refund. <br /> <br /> It never happened before or after Pleae has not rented this you will really regret it. I am really sure of the summary of the vote. Perhaps personal taste has something to do with it
